*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成-真实数据权重平衡，解决了小目标和标注数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的挑战，需要开发能够在实际限制下保持实时性能的鲁棒检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合增强小目标检测，不确定性最小化查询选择聚焦可靠提议，合成与真实数据权重平衡策略减少视觉差异，并使用数据增强平衡类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测管道，在极端光照或海况下仍保持实时性能，并通过组件分析量化了各架构模块的贡献。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，有效解决了海上目标检测的实际挑战。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DynamicEval基准，针对现有文本到视频评估基准在动态相机运动和视频级评估方面的不足，通过系统策划的动态相机运动提示词和45K人工标注，评估背景场景一致性和前景对象一致性两个关键维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频评估基准（如VBench和EvalCrafter）存在两个局限：一是主要关注主体中心提示词或静态相机场景，而动态相机运动对制作电影镜头至关重要但未被充分探索；二是通常将视频级分数聚合成模型级分数进行排名，忽视了视频级评估的重要性。

Method: 构建DynamicEval基准，包含系统策划的动态相机运动提示词和45K人工标注的视频对。提出两个新指标：基于对象错误图的背景一致性指标，修正遮挡/去遮挡问题；前景一致性指标，通过跟踪对象实例内的点及其邻居来评估对象保真度。

Result: 实验表明，提出的指标在视频级和模型级都与人类偏好有更强的相关性（提升超过2个百分点），确立了DynamicEval作为评估动态相机运动下文本到视频模型的更全面基准。

Conclusion: DynamicEval通过解决现有基准在动态相机运动和视频级评估方面的不足，提供了一个更全面的文本到视频模型评估框架，新提出的背景和前景一致性指标显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP是一种改进的RED算法，通过引入重启惯性机制实现快速收敛，同时保持基于分数的图像先验以获得高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED主要关注设计复杂的图像先验来提高重建质量，而收敛加速往往依赖启发式方法。RISP旨在弥合这一差距，实现快速收敛和高质量重建的平衡。

Method: RISP在RED基础上引入重启惯性机制，同时允许使用基于分数的图像先验。该方法还分析了相关的连续时间动力系统，揭示了与重球ODE的联系。

Result: 理论证明RISP比RED具有更快的驻点收敛速度，且不需要图像先验的凸性。实验表明RISP在各种成像逆问题中都能实现快速收敛和高质量重建。

Conclusion: RISP通过重启惯性机制成功实现了快速收敛和高质量图像重建的平衡，为成像逆问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，能够在资源受限的对抗环境下有效移除或削弱生成模型中的水印，同时保持视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，确保内容归属和来源的水印方法需求日益增长。然而现有的语义水印方案即使在资源受限的对抗设置下仍然存在漏洞。

Method: 通过将带水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，D2RA抑制水印信号同时保持视觉保真度。这是一种无需训练、无需访问底层模型的单图像攻击方法。

Result: 在多种水印方案上的实验表明，该方法能持续降低水印可检测性，揭示了当前水印设计的基本弱点。

Conclusion: D2RA攻击方法暴露了现有水印方案的脆弱性，为改进水印鲁棒性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [5] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个视频风格迁移框架，通过向预训练视频扩散模型插入低秩适配器和利用成对静态图像数据进行训练，实现内容保持和风格迁移的视频转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频风格迁移任务中缺乏成对视频数据监督的挑战，目标是保持输入视频内容的同时按照文本提示渲染目标风格。

Method: 在条件模块的自注意力层插入低秩适配器，利用成对图像数据构建合成训练片段，并引入上下文-风格分类器自由引导（CS-CFG）来分离内容和风格控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保持的视频转换，在定性和定量评估上都优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle框架通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的视频风格转换。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [6] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TRAVL方法改善视频语言模型的物理合理性判断能力，并创建ImplausiBench基准来评估模型的视觉-时间理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但缺乏定量评估物理真实性的方法。研究发现现有视频语言模型难以识别物理违规，暴露了其在时间和因果推理方面的局限性。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块，改进视频语言模型中的运动编码和判别能力。同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成），消除语言偏见并隔离视觉-时间理解。

Result: 性能通过人类判断和更严格的LLM作为评判指标进行报告。TRAVL和ImplausiBench为探索和改进多模态模型中的物理合理性提供了统一框架。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了视觉-时间理解中一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面，为评估和提高视频生成模型的物理真实性提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [7] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于视觉语言模型（VLM）的轻量级遗忘框架CAGUL，通过利用跨模态注意力来识别对输出生成不重要的视觉标记，从而在不改变预训练模型参数的情况下防止敏感信息泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆私有或敏感信息，并在推理时泄露这些信息。传统的机器遗忘方法主要针对语言模型，而VLM由于包含视觉上下文而增加了复杂性，需要专门的处理方案。

Method: 提出Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL)框架，利用跨模态注意力分析视觉标记对输出生成的重要性，通过外部模块对低重要性视觉标记进行编码转换，实现遗忘效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，CAGUL方法在防止信息泄露方面表现优于或与基于微调的基线方法相当，同时保留了参考模型的行为特征，且不改变预训练模型参数或产生重新训练成本。

Conclusion: CAGUL为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用且有效的遗忘解决方案，通过轻量级的外部模块实现敏感信息保护，避免了传统微调方法的高计算成本。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [8] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaizeStandCounting (MaSC) 是一个基于RGB图像和轻量级YOLOv9模型的自动化玉米植株计数算法，可在低成本无人机和硬件上运行，提供精确的行级植株计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数玉米植株既费时又容易出错，特别是在大面积或变化较大的田地中。需要一种自动化、可扩展且低成本的解决方案来准确计数玉米植株，以支持作物管理和研究。

Method: MaSC采用两种模式运行：(1) 将拼接图像分割成小块进行处理，(2) 使用单应性矩阵对齐原始视频帧。两种模式都使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长阶段的玉米幼苗，区分玉米与杂草和其他植被，然后基于检测结果的空间分布进行行和范围分割。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃的实地人工计数相比，MaSC与真实数据表现出强一致性（拼接图像R²=0.616，原始帧R²=0.906）。算法在60.63秒内处理了83个全分辨率帧，包括推理和后处理，显示出实时操作的潜力。

Conclusion: MaSC被证明是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米植株计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [9] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rectified-CFG++是一种自适应预测-校正引导方法，解决了标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过几何感知条件规则确保轨迹在数据流形附近保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类器自由引导在整流流模型中会引起严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和脆弱行为，需要开发更稳定的引导方法。

Method: 结合确定性整流流效率与几何感知条件规则，每个推理步骤先执行条件RF更新将样本锚定在学习到的传输路径附近，然后应用加权条件校正来插值条件和无条件速度场。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文生图模型上的实验表明，Rectified-CFG++在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic、T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上持续优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++生成的轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，确保在各种引导强度下的稳定性，同时保持边际一致性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

### [10] [PIT-QMM: A Large Multimodal Model For No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07636)
*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PIT-QMM，一种新颖的大型多模态模型，用于无参考点云质量评估，能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云数据，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了显著进展，但在3D资产领域尚未充分探索。本文旨在利用这些模型进行无参考点云质量评估，自动评估点云的感知质量。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端消费文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图等多种数据模态，利用这些互补信息预测点云质量分数。

Result: 在流行基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法以较少的训练迭代次数显著优于现有最先进方法，并能够实现失真定位和识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径，在点云质量评估方面取得了突破性进展。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at
https://www.github.com/shngt/pit-qmm.

### [11] [MONKEY: Masking ON KEY-Value Activation Adapter for Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07656)
*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进个性化扩散模型的方法，通过使用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码在第二次处理中限制图像标记到主体区域，让文本提示能够更好地控制背景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的个性化扩散模型在生成图像时往往过度关注主体而忽略文本提示，导致无法准确匹配用户描述的场景或位置。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码，在第二次处理过程中将图像标记限制在主体区域，使文本提示能够专注于控制背景内容的生成。

Result: 该方法在描述位置和场景的文本提示下，能够准确描绘主体同时精确匹配提示内容，相比其他测试时个性化方法显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过掩码限制图像标记到主体区域的方法有效解决了个性化扩散模型中主体过度重现和文本提示被忽略的问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和可控性。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

Method: 比较了四种方法：标准Transformer模型、小型视觉语言模型Phi3.5-vision、大型预训练VLM Gemini，以及处理多张图像的扩展Transformer模型。

Result: 标准Transformer模型通常优于基于VLM的方法，特别是在包含更丰富外观信息时。所有方法在处理非常小的文本或密集布局时都面临挑战。

Conclusion: 任务特定架构具有优势，为自动布局设计的进一步改进指明了方向。

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM
(Gemini), and an extended Transformer that processes multiple images.
Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

Conclusion: CNN-BYOL混合方法在感应电机故障检测中表现出色，为工业环境中的在线监测提供了强大的方法学。

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

### [14] [Mutual Learning for Hashing: Unlocking Strong Hash Functions from Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07703)
*Xiaoxu Ma,Runhao Li,Zhenyu Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MLH的弱到强哈希学习框架，通过让基于中心的强分支和基于成对的弱分支相互学习，结合全局数据分布和局部相似性信息，提升哈希检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中心的方法在建模全局结构方面表现出色，但往往未能充分利用重要的局部相似性信息。为了解决这一局限性，需要设计一种能够同时利用全局和局部信息的哈希学习方法。

Method: MLH框架包含两个分支：基于中心的强分支和基于成对的弱分支。通过迭代的相互学习过程，强分支从弱分支学习局部相似性线索。此外，引入了混合哈希专家模块，实现有效的跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MLH始终优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH通过弱到强的相互学习框架，成功地将基于中心方法的全局建模能力与基于成对方法的局部相似性保持能力相结合，显著提升了哈希检索性能。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: ComGS框架成功解决了高斯溅射中物体-场景组合的挑战，通过创新的SOPs技术和简化的光照估计方法，实现了高效、高质量的3D物体-场景组合渲染。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大、标准曝光下难以同时保留高光和阴影细节的问题，避免RGB多曝光方法中的错位和重影伪影。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围；第二阶段使用亮度感知RAW降噪器增强暗区域细节恢复。构建9档包围曝光流程合成真实UHDR图像数据集。

Result: UltraLED在广泛实验中显著优于现有单帧方法，能够有效避免重影和运动模糊，在动态场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量的UHDR重建，RAW图像的高位深和可预测噪声特性为暗区域信息恢复提供了更大潜力。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机可以异步捕捉快速视觉变化且对运动模糊具有鲁棒性，但缺乏颜色信息。结合这两种模态可以解决这一挑战。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1）使用LoCM无监督微调框架从事件流中提取运动先验；2）提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3）使用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据可以有效优化动态3D高斯泼溅。

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功结合RGB和事件两种模态，通过事件运动先验指导变形场优化，有效解决了低帧率视频重建动态3D高斯泼溅的挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Result: 在12个图像分类数据集上，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最高准确率，超越线性探测平均准确率，对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和有效数据增强，显著提升了视觉提示的性能，同时保持推理时的低计算开销。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在紧凑场景中实现了实时逼真渲染，但在大规模城市场景中会出现严重的走样伪影和优化不稳定问题，特别是在高分辨率渲染下。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性问题，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的框架，与现有管道兼容，通过物理基础的正则化有效解决了3D高斯溅射在大规模城市场景中的走样问题，显著提升了渲染质量和稳定性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: ASBench是第一个专门评估异常合成方法的综合基准框架，通过系统评估为异常合成研究提供了重要工具和方向指导。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

Conclusion: TTOM是一个无需训练的实用框架，能够实时实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐，解决了视频基础模型在组合场景中的性能问题。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation

Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations

achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection

Conclusion: SimCast和CasCast框架在不增加推理开销的情况下显著提高了降水临近预报的准确性，解决了确定性预测的模糊性和分布偏移问题。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像恢复框架，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制执行高频感知重建来重新定义VAE，在效率和细节保留之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UHD图像恢复中计算效率与高频细节保留之间的权衡问题，传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定的高频信息，影响重建保真度。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段提出LH-VAE，通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建；第二阶段使用HF-LoRA联合训练，包含保真度导向的高频对齐损失和感知导向的损失，通过交替优化和选择性梯度传播训练。

Result: 实验表明Latent Harmony在UHD和标准分辨率任务上实现了最先进的性能，有效平衡了效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重新定义VAE和引入高频感知机制，成功解决了UHD图像恢复中的效率-保真度权衡问题，提供灵活的质量控制参数。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的有效性，发现在标签预算有限时抽象标签更有效，而当标签数量充足时对象标签同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在图像隐私这一上下文依赖且主观性强的任务中，对象标签和抽象标签哪种更适合。对象标签表示具体实体，而抽象标签捕捉更高层次的上下文信息。

Method: 比较分析对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类任务中的表现，特别关注不同标签数量预算下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；但当每个图像可用的标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将为未来开发更准确的图像隐私分类器提供指导，强调了标签类型和数量在隐私分类中的重要作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

TL;DR: 本文比较了Transformer模型SwinIR与轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能与效率权衡。虽然SwinIR达到更高的PSNR（39.03 dB），但轻量级CNN以37.4 dB的竞争性性能，仅需10个训练周期（相比SwinIR的132个周期），且模型大小小55倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复与严重噪声抑制的挑战，同时关注实际应用中计算成本的问题。

Method: 通过实验比较最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级CNN模型，在低光图像恢复任务上评估性能与效率的权衡。

Result: SwinIR达到39.03 dB PSNR峰值性能，轻量级CNN达到37.4 dB PSNR，但CNN仅需10个训练周期收敛，模型大小比SwinIR小55倍以上。

Conclusion: 标准CNN在显著降低计算开销的情况下能提供接近最先进水平的性能，在资源受限的实际场景中具有明显优势。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

TL;DR: CIR-CoT是一个端到端的检索导向多模态大语言模型，通过显式的思维链推理来提升组合图像检索的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的组合图像检索方法主要基于视觉语言模型和多模态大语言模型，但这些模型作为"黑盒"存在，用户无法理解检索原理，模型也难以遵循复杂细粒度的指令。

Method: 提出CIR-CoT模型，强制模型首先生成可解释的推理链，然后将其最终的检索意图编码到专用嵌入中。通过三阶段过程创建结构化思维链注释，包括描述、推理和结论。

Result: CIR-CoT在领域内数据集（FashionIQ、CIRR）上取得了极具竞争力的性能，并在领域外CIRCO数据集上表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信赖的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过显式推理链增强了跨模态交互的捕获能力，同时使决策过程透明化。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Conclusion: RayFusion方法通过射线融合有效缓解了深度估计的模糊性，为纯相机协作感知系统提供了性能提升的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，使得润色过程不透明，难以处理多样化的用户或图像特定调整。

Method: 系统包含视觉批评器识别输入与参考图像差异，以及代码生成器产生可执行代码，以类似人类多步骤润色的方式逐步增强图像。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释且可控的图像润色解决方案，能够根据用户意图进行定制化调整。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Conclusion: 提出的物理驱动检测方法能有效识别AI生成视频，为视频真实性验证提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real- world settings.

Motivation: 传统为自然图像设计的增强方法直接应用于CT图像时，忽视了CT模态的特性（HU值具有重要物理意义），可能导致伪影和泛化能力差。需要开发专门针对CT图像的增强技术。

Method: 提出了随机窗位增强技术，该方法利用CT图像中可用的Hounsfield单位强度分布，鼓励模型对对比度增强具有鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行消融实验和分析，该方法显著提高了模型在对比度差或时机不佳的挑战性图像上的性能，并优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 随机窗位是一种有效的CT特定增强技术，能够显著提升肝肿瘤分割任务的模型性能，特别是在处理对比度增强变化时表现出色。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Motivation: 解决实时运动可控视频生成的挑战，包括双向扩散模型的固有延迟问题，以及现有自回归视频扩散模型在少步生成中的质量下降和运动伪影问题。

Method: 首先微调基础图像到视频模型以支持基本运动控制，然后通过强化学习使用基于轨迹的奖励模型进行改进，通过自滚动机制保持马尔可夫性质，并在去噪步骤中选择性引入随机性来加速训练。

Result: AR-Drag实现了高视觉保真度和精确的运动对齐，与最先进的运动可控视频扩散模型相比显著降低了延迟，仅使用13亿参数。

Conclusion: AR-Drag是第一个RL增强的少步自回归视频扩散模型，成功解决了实时运动可控视频生成的关键挑战，在延迟和生成质量方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TCAS的注意力增强方法，通过提高视频语言模型中交叉模态注意力头的时间分辨能力，来解决模型在重述问题中产生自相矛盾输出的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象表现为模型无法基于其基础输出为重新表述的问题提供逻辑一致的响应，但其根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结和干预该现象的可能因素。提出TCAS方法，基于注意力差异构建增强目标，提升模型的时间分辨能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提高了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性。可解释性分析证实该方法确实改善了注意力头的时间区分能力。此外，在一般视频时间定位任务中也实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解的瓶颈，通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有级联视频超分辨率方法主要局限于文本到视频任务，未能充分利用文本之外的多模态生成条件，而这些条件对于确保多模态视频生成的保真度至关重要。

Method: 在潜在视频扩散模型中，全面探索了条件注入策略、训练方案和数据混合技术，设计了不同的数据构建和条件利用方法，使模型能够精确利用所有条件类型。

Result: 实验表明UniMMVSR显著优于现有方法，生成的视频具有更优的细节和更高的多模态条件一致性，并验证了与基础模型结合实现4K视频多模态引导生成的可行性。

Conclusion: UniMMVSR成功解决了多模态条件利用的挑战，为高分辨率视频生成提供了有效的统一框架，实现了此前无法达到的4K视频多模态引导生成能力。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

TL;DR: MURE是一个多模态推理编辑框架，通过交错的文本-图像思维链来解决复杂图像编辑任务，引入多模态深度置信度推理来减少幻觉现象，在三个图像编辑基准上取得显著改进。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于自然语言的图像编辑方法在处理复杂对象交叉和细粒度空间关系时缺乏显式推理过程，纯文本思维链或坐标增强思维链在表示复杂视觉布局和指导像素级细节生成方面存在根本限制。

Method: 提出多模态推理编辑框架，将视觉编辑过程从纯文本推理转变为交错的文本和视觉推理链，每个步骤包含文本描述和相应的视觉提示（如位置掩码或新内容表示），并引入多模态深度置信度推理范式来修剪低质量分支。

Conclusion: MURE框架通过交错的文本-图像思维链和多模态深度置信度推理，有效解决了复杂图像编辑中的推理挑战，显著提升了编辑精度和结果质量。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自举算法，通过迭代重新对齐训练样本来处理细粒度视觉分类中的几何偏差问题，该方法在四个FGVC基准测试中表现优于等变和规范化基线，与数据增强方法性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类任务需要处理几何偏差和噪声（如不同方向和尺度的物体），现有方法依赖大量数据增强或等变架构，但前者需要强大模型，后者限制表达能力并增加成本。规范化方法提供了一种替代方案，但实际中由于训练数据未对齐，获得的规范化器往往脆弱。

Method: 提出一种自举算法，通过迭代重新对齐训练样本，逐步减少方差并恢复对齐假设。该算法为任意紧致群建立了在温和条件下的收敛保证。

Result: 在四个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中，该方法一致地优于等变和规范化基线，与数据增强方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的自举算法能够有效处理细粒度视觉分类中的几何偏差问题，在保持性能的同时避免了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag是一个基于扩散模型的框架，结合文本指令和对象拖拽，实现同时进行对象拖拽和基于文本的图像编辑，解决了现有方法在精确定位和静态重定位方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在图像编辑中存在局限性：基于文本的方法难以精确定位对象，而对象拖拽方法仅限于静态重定位。需要一种能够同时实现精确对象定位和语义控制的编辑方法。

Method: 将对象拖拽视为图像重建过程，分为两个协同分支：移动重建分支使用基于能量的梯度引导来精确移动对象，并优化交叉注意力图以提高重定位精度；文本驱动编辑分支与重建分支共享梯度信号，确保一致的变换并允许对对象属性进行细粒度控制。同时使用DDPM反演并在噪声图中注入先验信息以保持移动对象的结构。

Result: 大量实验表明，InstructUDrag实现了灵活、高保真度的图像编辑，在对象重定位精度和图像内容语义控制方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: InstructUDrag框架成功结合了文本指令和对象拖拽的优势，为图像编辑提供了更精确的定位能力和更丰富的语义控制能力，是图像编辑领域的一个重要进展。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对遥感图像单正多标签学习的自适应梯度校准框架AdaGC，通过梯度校准机制、Mixup和双EMA模块来缓解监督模糊性问题，在两种不同标签噪声类型下均达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像的多标签分类比单标签分类能提供更全面的语义理解，但获取完整标注成本高昂。单正多标签学习(SPML)作为实用替代方案，每个图像仅标注一个相关标签，但引入了严重的监督模糊性，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出AdaGC框架，包含梯度校准(GC)机制、Mixup和双指数移动平均(EMA)模块，用于鲁棒的伪标签生成。引入基于训练动态的自适应触发机制，在初始预热阶段后自适应启动GC，确保有效缓解标签噪声过拟合。

Result: 在两个基准遥感数据集上的广泛实验表明，AdaGC在两种不同标签噪声类型下均实现了最先进的性能，并在多样化设置中保持了强大的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGC是一个新颖且可泛化的SPML框架，专门针对遥感图像设计，通过自适应梯度校准有效解决了单正多标签学习中的监督模糊性问题。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Result: 实验验证NTN-Diff在文本引导扩散模型中优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率带分解和分阶段去噪策略，有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的关键挑战

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过堆叠稀疏局部注意力和全局查询交互来平衡局部性和全局性，在四个参考视频分割基准上取得了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参考视频分割（RVOS）的关键是从语言表达和视频的交互中提取长程时序上下文信息。现有方法要么在所有帧上使用注意力，要么堆叠密集局部注意力，但无法在局部性和全局性之间取得良好平衡，且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增加。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力，设计跨帧的扩张窗口注意力来聚合局部上下文信息，并通过层叠实现全局视图；2）让每个查询关注从全局池中随机选择的一小组键来增强全局性；3）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互以直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个参考视频分割基准上取得了新的最先进性能，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制能够有效平衡局部性和全局性，显著提升参考视频分割性能，同时控制计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.

*Yu Huang,Zelin Peng,Changsong Wen,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语义基础的3D可操作性分割框架，通过跨模态亲和力转移将2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，解决了3D数据稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性等固有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D可操作性分割方法依赖点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽略了3D数据的固有挑战，导致学习到的特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 提出跨模态亲和力转移预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，并联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；在此基础上设计跨模态可操作性分割变换器，集成多模态提示与预训练特征生成精确的分割图。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D可操作性分割方面取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 通过将2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，该工作显著提升了3D可操作性分割的性能，为机器人操作、具身AI等应用提供了更可靠的功能解析能力。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

*Yushi Huang,Xingtong Ge,Ruihao Gong,Chengtao Lv,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的数据无关后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来加速视频扩散模型，同时保持原始模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但由于其表达能力有限和视频生成的时空建模复杂性，完全替换二次注意力需要昂贵的预训练。

Method: 提出选择性转移方法，将层选择视为二元分类问题，自动渐进地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍的加速，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现了15.92倍的延迟减少，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效解决了视频扩散模型计算效率问题，通过智能层选择和高效分布匹配目标，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DTPQA基准测试，专门评估小规模视觉语言模型在交通场景中的感知能力，特别是远距离感知性能，发现当前模型与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是对远距离物体的准确感知。现有视觉语言模型在交通场景中的感知性能缺乏专门评估，且大型模型不适用于资源受限的自动驾驶硬件。

Method: 创建了DTPQA基准测试，专注于交通场景中的纯感知问题，排除推理要求，并包含距离标注。评估了多个最先进的小型视觉语言模型在该基准上的表现。

Result: 最佳小型VLM的平均准确率约为60%，远低于人类约85%的表现。模型在区分左右等特定感知任务上表现尤为困难。

Conclusion: 当前小型视觉语言模型在交通场景感知方面仍有明显不足，特别是在远距离感知和方向判断等任务上，需要进一步改进以满足自动驾驶系统的安全要求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

TL;DR: UniVideo是一个统一的多模态视频生成和编辑框架，采用双流设计结合MLLM和MMDiT，能够处理文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等多种任务，并支持任务组合和跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，本文旨在将统一建模扩展到视频领域，解决多模态指令理解和视觉一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用双流架构：多模态大语言模型(MLLM)用于理解指令，多模态DiT(MMDiT)用于视频生成。通过联合训练统一处理多种视频生成和编辑任务。

Result: 实验表明UniVideo在文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等任务上达到或超越了最先进的特定任务基线模型，并展示了任务组合和跨任务泛化的能力。

Conclusion: UniVideo成功将统一多模态建模扩展到视频领域，支持多种视频任务并具备良好的泛化能力，为未来研究提供了有价值的框架。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗图像数据隐私和安全问题，现有源自由域适应方法主要关注伪标签优化而忽略了学习过程，渐进式学习过程有助于知识迁移。

Method: 提出LFC框架，包含从易到难和从源到目标两个课程：前者从简单样本开始学习并逐步增加难度调整优化方向；后者确保模型从源域到目标域的平稳迁移。

Result: 在眼底分割和息肉分割的跨域数据集上评估，实验结果表明该方法超越了现有方法，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 所提出的源自由域适应框架通过课程学习策略有效解决了医疗图像域适应问题，在保护数据隐私的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: VideoVerse是一个新的文本到视频生成基准测试，专注于评估模型对真实世界复杂时间因果性和世界知识的理解能力，包含300个精心策划的提示，涉及815个事件和793个二元评估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估最先进的文本到视频模型时存在不足：当前评估维度无法区分顶级模型；事件级时间因果性严重不足；缺乏对世界知识的系统评估。

Method: 收集跨领域代表性视频，提取具有固有时间因果性的事件级描述，由独立标注者改写为文本到视频提示，设计包含10个维度的二元评估问题，开发基于现代视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐QA评估流程。

Result: 构建了包含300个提示、815个事件和793个评估问题的VideoVerse基准，对开源和闭源T2V模型进行了系统评估。

Conclusion: VideoVerse为评估T2V模型是否能够理解复杂时间因果性和世界知识提供了全面基准，有助于分析当前T2V生成器与世界模型之间的差距。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到通用应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，解决了原sCM在细节生成上的质量限制，在140亿参数模型和5秒视频任务上实现1-4步高质量生成，加速扩散采样15-50倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性问题，特别是基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的局限性，以及sCM在精细细节生成中的基本质量限制。

Method: 开发并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP核，提出分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，通过分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，结合sCM的前向散度和反向散度的模式寻求特性。

Result: 在140亿参数模型和5秒视频任务上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的蒸馏方法DMD2，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索，仅需1-4步生成高保真样本。

Conclusion: rCM作为一个实用且理论基础的框架，为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了有效解决方案，实现了15-50倍的扩散采样加速。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够处理从基础灰度量化到复杂几何特征提取的多种任务，满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括：步进强度变换进行灰度量化、RGB和YCrCb色彩空间的直方图均衡化、HSV值通道亮度调整、3×3卷积核图像锐化、结合非锐化掩蔽、伽马校正和噪声放大的双向变换管道，以及Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测和形态学窗口定位等几何特征提取方法。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架在图像处理任务中表现出色，具有实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的潜力，为复杂视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

Motivation: 手语中的象似性（语言形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了天然测试平台，研究旨在评估视觉语言模型从动态人体动作中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，采用心理语言学测量方法，在零样本和少样本设置下评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型在荷兰手语上的表现，并与人类基线进行比较。

Result: 在音系形式预测方面，模型能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务上远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评级有中等相关性。有趣的是，音系形式预测能力更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 研究验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，并表明需要以人为本的信号和具身学习方法，以建模象似性并改进多模态模型中的视觉基础。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在RSNA颅内出血检测数据集上评估，模型在诊断准确性和报告生成方面均优于传统基于CNN的模型。

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in
emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is
crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based
approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma
cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to
capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The
AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate
anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates
coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range
dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial
Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models
in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only
supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a
powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback
and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential
of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation
to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain
injuries.

TL;DR: MoA-VR是一个基于多智能体协作的视频修复系统，通过三个协调的智能体（退化识别、路由修复、质量评估）模拟人类专家的处理流程，有效处理复杂多样的视频退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频常因采集和传输条件而遭受复杂退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真），现有方法需要手动选择专业模型或使用单一架构，难以泛化处理不同退化类型。

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率视频退化识别基准，使用视觉语言模型进行退化识别；引入基于大语言模型的自适应路由器学习修复策略；构建Res-VQ数据集并设计专门的VLM视频质量评估模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoA-VR能有效处理多样化和复合退化，在客观指标和感知质量上均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了多模态智能和模块化推理在通用视频修复系统中的整合潜力。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉变换器(ViT)中存在高范数视觉标记(ViT注意力汇点)，这些标记包含高级语义信息，但现有大视觉语言模型(LVLMs)架构中常被忽视。作者提出了训练无关和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些标记，显著提升了视觉推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇点，但很少研究ViT中的视觉标记如何影响LVLMs的理解和推理能力。作者发现ViT中存在一类高范数视觉标记(称为ViT注意力汇点)，这些标记包含重要的语义信息，但当前LVLM架构未能充分利用。

Method: 提出了定性和定量分析ViT汇点标记中嵌入的信息，并开发了训练无关和基于训练的方法来优化LLM对这些标记的解释和利用程度。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇点标记，在各种LVLMs和视觉推理任务上实现了显著改进，证明了ViT注意力汇点在增强视觉推理方面的未开发潜力。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇点标记包含关键的语义信息，有效利用这些标记可以显著提升大视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，为LVLM架构优化提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义场景图的3D点云深度压缩框架，能够在保持结构和语义保真度的同时，将数据大小减少高达98%，并支持多机器人位姿图优化和地图融合等下游应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在集中式和分散式多智能体机器人系统中，3D点云数据的高效传输对于高级感知至关重要，但点云的大规模和复杂特性在带宽受限和连接不稳定的情况下会降低系统性能。

Method: 该方法将点云分解为语义一致的补丁，使用基于特征线性调制（FiLM）的语义感知编码器将其编码为紧凑的潜在表示，并通过基于折叠的解码器在潜在特征和图节点属性的指导下进行结构准确的重建。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了最先进的压缩率，同时保持了结构和语义保真度。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现了高效的点云压缩，还支持下游应用，如多机器人位姿图优化和地图融合，其轨迹精度和地图对齐效果与原始LiDAR扫描相当。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

TL;DR: FlexTraj是一个用于图像到视频生成的框架，通过统一的基于点的运动表示实现灵活的点轨迹控制。该框架使用序列拼接方案实现快速收敛和高效推理，并通过退火训练策略减少对完整监督的依赖。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决图像到视频生成中轨迹控制的灵活性问题，特别是如何在保持时间一致性的同时支持密集和稀疏轨迹控制，并提高训练效率和推理速度。

Method: 提出统一的点轨迹表示方法，包含分割ID、时间一致轨迹ID和可选颜色通道；采用序列拼接方案替代传统条件注入方法；使用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明FlexTraj支持多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，能够应用于运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向等多种应用场景。

Conclusion: FlexTraj框架成功实现了灵活的点轨迹控制，在保持鲁棒性的同时提高了训练效率和推理速度，为图像到视频生成提供了更强大的控制能力。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种渐进式训练框架SpatialLadder，通过三阶段训练方法（空间感知、空间理解和复杂推理）来构建视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在局限性，主要原因是缺乏从感知到理解的层次化基础。作者认为需要建立渐进式的空间智能构建方法。

Method: 构建了SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集（26,610个样本），并设计了三个阶段渐进训练框架：1）通过目标定位建立空间感知；2）通过多维空间任务发展空间理解；3）通过可验证奖励的强化学习加强复杂推理。

Result: SpatialLadder（3B参数模型）在空间推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，相比基础模型平均提升23.4%，超过GPT-4o 20.8%和Gemini-2.0-Flash 10.1%，在域外基准测试中也有7.2%的改进。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建鲁棒的空间智能至关重要，该方法显著提升了视觉语言模型的空间推理能力并保持了良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型在长链反思推理方面的能力不足问题，提出了MM-HELIX基准测试和AHPO训练策略，显著提升了模型在复杂推理任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在数学和逻辑推理任务上表现出色，但在解决复杂现实问题所需的长链反思推理能力方面仍有不足，需要系统性地探索和提升。

Method: 首先构建了包含1,260个样本的MM-HELIX多模态基准测试，然后开发了Step-Elicited Response Generation流水线创建100K规模的反思推理轨迹数据集，最后提出了自适应混合策略优化(AHPO)训练方法，将离线监督和在线优化动态统一。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B基准模型上，该方法在MM-HELIX基准上实现了+18.6%的准确率提升，在通用数学和逻辑任务上平均性能增益达到+5.7%。

Conclusion: 研究表明多模态大语言模型的反思推理能力可以通过有效学习得到显著提升和泛化，为开发更强大的多模态模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的文化基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，涵盖中美文化背景下的社会文化规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试工具。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：使用基于理论提示的教师模型生成候选标注，由训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 基准测试显示：1）模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；2）对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3）提供非语言证据比语言证据更困难；4）在正式、非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架开始填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法存在保真度与效率的权衡：逐场景优化计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计了具有LoD感知渲染策略的分层高斯表示。

Result: 在8个不同室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO提供与SLAM相当的交互性能，与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了实用路径，兼具准确几何和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

Motivation: 现有记忆持久性VLN方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效记忆访问机制，依赖完整记忆整合或固定范围查找；主要存储环境观察而忽略编码宝贵决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态，用于编码经验和生成检索查询；2) 混合视角级记忆，将观察和行为模式锚定到视角，实现混合检索；3) 经验增强导航模型，通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景的多样化记忆持久性VLN基准上，Memoir在所有场景中均显著改进：在IR2R上比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4% SPL，同时实现8.3倍训练加速和74%推理内存减少。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆可实现更有效的导航，分析表明这种想象力引导范式具有巨大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在处理用户指定的任意空间位置和时间戳的补丁时面临时序模糊问题，这限制了灵活的视频编辑能力。

Method: 采用混合条件策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时序对齐通过时序RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配连续分数位置，无需新增参数。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas建立了灵活统一视频生成的新技术标准，成功解决了时序模糊问题，实现了像素级帧感知控制。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain

contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise

challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,

Result: 广泛的定性和定量实验表明，多模态控制能够实现更动态、可定制和上下文准确的视觉叙事。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态控制视频插帧框架在灵活性、易用性和精度之间取得了平衡，能够更好地满足用户的创意需求。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

TL;DR: ResAD提出了一种归一化残差轨迹建模框架，通过预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差来解决端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，显著简化学习任务并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有的时空不平衡问题，导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先考虑不确定的远距离预测而危及即时安全。

Method: 提出ResAD框架，将学习任务重新定义为预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差，并使用点级归一化处理优化不平衡问题。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅有两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最优PDMS分数。

Conclusion: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模和点级归一化，有效解决了端到端自动驾驶的时空不平衡问题，显著简化了学习任务并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的原生端到端训练方法，探索了其设计空间和扩展特性，提出了名为NaViL的原生MLLM模型，并在14个多模态基准测试中验证了其竞争力。

Conclusion: 原生MLLMs的端到端训练是可行的，研究结果为未来原生MLLMs的研究提供了深入见解，证明了视觉编码器与LLMs扩展的正相关性。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了D²GS框架，通过深度密度引导的dropout策略和距离感知保真度增强模块，解决3D高斯溅射在稀疏视角下的过拟合和欠拟合问题，显著提升了重建质量和稳定性。

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在稀疏视角条件下存在性能下降和不稳定问题，主要表现为相机附近高斯密度过高的过拟合区域和远处高斯覆盖不足的欠拟合区域。

Method: 提出统一框架D²GS，包含两个关键组件：1）深度密度引导dropout策略，基于密度和深度自适应掩码冗余高斯；2）距离感知保真度增强模块，通过针对性监督改善远场欠拟合区域的重建质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在稀疏视角条件下显著提高了视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视角3D高斯溅射的过拟合和欠拟合问题，并引入了新的评估指标来量化学习高斯分布的稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

TL;DR: ReSplat是一种前馈循环高斯溅射模型，通过迭代细化3D高斯而不显式计算梯度，利用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新，在减少高斯数量和提升渲染速度的同时实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统前馈高斯溅射模型依赖单次前向传播，性能受限。需要一种能够迭代优化高斯表示的方法，同时保持计算效率。

Method: 提出循环高斯溅射模型，使用渲染误差作为反馈信号指导高斯更新；引入紧凑重建模型在16倍下采样空间初始化，大幅减少高斯数量。

Result: 在多种输入视图(2,8,16)、分辨率(256×256到540×960)和数据集(DL3DV、RealEstate10K)上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进性能，同时显著减少高斯数量并提升渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环反馈机制有效解决了前馈高斯溅射模型的性能限制，在保持计算效率的同时实现了更好的泛化能力和渲染质量。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

TL;DR: 本文实证研究了最新一代大型语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的能力，与传统监督方法进行比较，发现在缺乏目标领域训练数据的情况下，LLMs通过上下文直接生成词形还原结果，在大多数语言中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性尚无先验证据，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 比较了(i)在域外微调的仅编码器监督方法，(ii)跨语言方法，与(iii)LLMs直接上下文词形还原生成方法，在12种不同形态复杂度的语言上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现，虽然编码器在域外设置下使用黄金数据微调仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs通过仅提供少量示例直接上下文生成词形还原，在大多数语言中达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs能够在没有先验微调的情况下，仅通过少量上下文示例直接生成词形还原结果，在多数语言中超越传统监督方法。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如WER对不影响句子语义的形态和句法细微差异惩罚过重，需要更语义感知的评估方法。

Method: 利用最先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示学习评分规则；同时展示如何通过微调较小LLM来预测惩罚类型。

Result: 使用Gemini 2.5 Pro的印地语LASER评分与人类标注达到94%的高相关性；印地语示例对其他印度语言（马拉地语、卡纳达语、马拉雅拉姆语）也有效；微调Llama 3在词对示例上预测惩罚类型准确率接近89%。

Conclusion: LASER框架提供了一种更语义感知的ASR评估方法，能够跨语言泛化，且小模型微调也能获得良好性能。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多智能体系统中表现出色，但设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难，主要由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性。现有的自动提示设计方法主要针对单智能体，多智能体提示优化仍未被充分探索。

Method: MAPRO框架将MAS提示优化建模为MAP推理问题，使用语言引导的max-product置信传播算法。采用拓扑感知的精炼机制，整合执行反馈和下游责任来选择性更新智能体提示，逐步收敛到协调的智能体特定提示策略。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提升了多智能体系统的性能，其基于MAP的公式化为构建更可靠和原则化的多智能体系统提供了通用指导原则。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤与解码循环，解决了测试时缩放中KV缓存线性增长导致的内存瓶颈问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放通过长链思维提升LLM推理能力，但KV缓存的线性增长加剧了内存瓶颈。现有的查询感知稀疏解码方法受限于顺序依赖的页面过滤和粗粒度token选择，在高并发和长链思维场景下效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含两个核心组件：(1)轻量级时间回归模块预测下一token查询状态；(2)异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离，通过异步机制重叠token级KV选择与前向推理计算。

Result: 在A100节点上的实验表明，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，达到理论最优时间每输出token。相比SoTA基线Quest减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50% TPOT，同时在各种TTS基准测试中保持或超越准确性。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade是首个在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除顺序依赖的方法，显著提升了测试时缩放场景下的LLM服务效率。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

Motivation: 虽然基于大语言模型的多智能体系统受到关注，但对其团队动态的研究较少，受人类团队科学启发，本研究旨在探索多智能体团队的核心特性。

Method: 提出了一个多智能体框架，评估团队在四个任务（CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa、Latent Implicit Hate）上的表现，涵盖常识推理和社交推理。

Result: 扁平化团队表现优于层级化团队，多样性影响复杂；智能体对团队表现过度自信，但任务后反思显示对协作的认可和整合挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队的结构和多样性对性能有重要影响，智能体在协作中存在过度自信和整合挑战，需要改进对话协调机制。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are

team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

Result: 思维链微调使语音大语言模型在口语推理任务上的准确率平均提升2.4倍；提出的早期推理方法在同等延迟条件下在ARC-Easy上获得4%准确率提升；DPO优化实现了70%的延迟降低且无准确率损失。

Conclusion: 思维链微调能有效提升语音大语言模型的推理能力，结合问题完整性指标和DPO优化可以在保持高准确性的同时显著降低响应延迟，为语音交互系统提供了更好的准确性与延迟权衡方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

*Soyeong Jeong,Taehee Jung,Sung Ju Hwang,Joo-Kyung Kim,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为思想模板的方法，通过重用先前问题解决轨迹中的思想缓存来指导多跳推理，解决了长上下文语言模型在处理大量文档时无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的长上下文语言模型虽然能够处理大量文档，但简单地将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕捉证据应该如何连接，这限制了多跳推理的效果。

Method: 使用思想模板将推理过程重新构建为可重用的思想缓存，通过自然语言反馈迭代优化模板，并在检索和非检索设置下验证方法有效性。

Result: 在不同基准测试和LCLM家族中，该方法相比强基线模型取得了持续的性能提升，优化后的模板可以蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: 思想模板增强的长上下文语言模型框架（ToTAL）能够实现透明推理重用，具有广泛的适用性，显著提升了多跳推理能力。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的波斯语-塔吉克语双向音译模型，通过整合所有可用数据集并在多个领域进行训练，实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语作为双语种语言，在阿富汗和伊朗使用波斯-阿拉伯文字，在塔吉克斯坦使用塔吉克-西里尔文字。虽然各国方言相似，但文字差异阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家之间的书面交流。现有音译模型大多局限于特定领域，缺乏实际应用的通用性。

Method: 开发了一个序列到序列的音译模型，整合了所有可用的数据集进行训练，并创建了两个新的数据集。模型在多个文本领域进行训练，以提高通用性。

Result: 模型在波斯语到塔吉克语方向取得了87.91的chrF++分数和0.05的标准化CER分数，在塔吉克语到波斯语方向取得了92.28的chrF++分数和0.04的标准化CER分数，建立了全面的基准性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个跨领域的波斯语-塔吉克语音译解决方案，通过整合多领域数据和先进模型，显著提升了音译性能，为实际应用提供了可行的工具。

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available
at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ParsTranslit-FB30/.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了OWL模型来解决现有推测解码方法在长上下文场景下的性能退化问题，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合算法实现了在长上下文输入中比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准测试中表现良好，但在实际长上下文工作负载中性能严重下降，甚至导致生成速度变慢，需要解决长上下文场景下的推测解码问题。

Method: 提出OWL模型，包含三个创新：(1) 基于LSTM的drafter，仅依赖最后token状态实现长度泛化；(2) 验证器中引入特殊token [SPEC]为drafter提供更丰富的表示；(3) 结合树和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入中实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，显著提升了长上下文场景下的推测解码性能。

Conclusion: OWL模型有效解决了长上下文推测解码的挑战，通过创新的架构设计实现了显著的性能提升，并发布了LongSpecBench基准测试和所有代码数据集以推动未来研究。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

TL;DR: 本研究提出两种方法提升小参数视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中的评估能力：多标准提示和领域自适应迁移学习，开发了ChartJudge模型，在资源受限环境下实现高效评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然7B参数的大视觉语言模型在图表理解任务中表现出作为自动评估器的潜力，但小参数模型（≤2B）表现仍然较差，限制了其在资源受限环境中的实际应用。

Method: 提出两种方法：(1) 多标准提示，将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中；(2) 领域自适应迁移学习，在图表数据集上使用合成判断对2B参数模型进行微调，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了鲁棒性差距，导致7B模型性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能够有效在不同数据集间迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过对图表类型和查询复杂度的细粒度分析，为模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡提供了可行见解，实现了图表推理任务的可扩展、低成本评估。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型输入词汇表示的结构如何形成，以及这种结构在训练过程中如何演化，特别是词汇嵌入几何与语言特征的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型进行实验，将输入和输出嵌入的几何结构与语义、句法和频率指标在训练过程中进行相关性分析。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练过程中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词更快收敛到最终向量，后者保留了一些随机初始化的偏差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了词汇几何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，显示了词频和功能的独特作用，为研究词汇几何演化如何促进模型训练中特定能力获得提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在临床编码任务中表现不佳，特别是存在层次性近错问题，而传统精确匹配评估方法无法有效识别这类错误。需要更有效的方法来提升医疗编码的准确性。

Method: 采用轻量级干预方法（包括提示工程和小规模微调），引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并构建了专家双标注的门诊临床笔记ICD-10编码基准数据集。

Result: 验证被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效且可靠步骤，轻量级干预方法能够在不增加计算开销的情况下提升准确性。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是解决LLM层次性近错问题的有效方法，构建的高质量数据集为未来研究提供了更好的评估基准。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

*Đorđe Klisura,Joseph Khoury,Ashish Kundu,Ram Krishnan,Anthony Rios*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型在角色条件拒绝方面的能力，通过扩展Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，评估了三种方法在访问控制策略下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 访问控制是安全计算的基础，但大型语言模型经常通过产生不受限制的响应来模糊角色边界。研究旨在评估LLM通过在被授权时回答和未被授权时拒绝来遵守访问控制策略的能力。

Method: 创建了一个新颖的数据集，扩展了Spider和BIRD文本到SQL数据集，添加了表级和列级的PostgreSQL基于角色的策略。比较了三种设计：(i)零样本或少样本提示，(ii)两步生成器-验证器管道检查SQL是否符合策略，(iii)LoRA微调模型直接学习权限感知。

Result: 在多个模型家族中，显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可。同时，微调在安全性和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。更长和更复杂的策略持续降低了所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究发布了基于角色的访问控制增强数据集和代码，表明显式验证和微调方法都能有效提高LLM在访问控制策略下的表现，但复杂策略对所有系统都构成挑战。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache提出了一种基于结构化剪枝理论的缓存淘汰框架，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化LLM长上下文缓存管理，相比启发式方法能持续提升长上下文准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存淘汰方法通常使用累积注意力权重启发式地评估token重要性，但未考虑其对注意力输出的真实影响，导致内存开销大且准确性受限。

Method: 基于最优脑损伤理论，将缓存淘汰建模为分层结构化剪枝问题，通过闭式公式量化token重要性，考虑注意力权重、值状态信息和注意力输出。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知分数替换现有工作的启发式分数，能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个原则性的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的token重要性评估，有效解决了LLM长上下文应用中的内存开销问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的训练依赖于AI宪法和模型规范来建立行为准则和伦理原则，但这些规范面临内部原则冲突和对细微场景覆盖不足的关键挑战。

Method: 使用全面的分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，在这些场景中模型必须在无法同时满足的合法原则对之间做出选择。通过价值分类分数评估12个前沿LLM的响应，并测量行为分歧。

Result: 在测试场景中识别出超过70,000个表现出显著行为分歧的案例。实证表明模型行为的高度分歧强烈预示着模型规范中的潜在问题。定性分析揭示了当前模型规范中的直接矛盾和多个原则的解释模糊性等问题。

Conclusion: 该方法有效揭示了模型规范中的系统性问题，包括原则冲突、解释模糊性、明显错位案例和误报拒绝。研究还提供了这些模型的价值优先级模式和差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表面语言线索，难以有效泛化到不同风格变化。不同平台的仇恨言论针对不同群体并采用独特风格，可能引发与标签的虚假相关性。

Method: 将仇恨言论生成建模为包含上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格等关键因素的因果图，提出CADET框架进行因果表示学习，解构仇恨言论为可解释潜在因素并控制混杂变量。

Conclusion: 因果先验在推进可泛化仇恨言论检测方面具有潜力，CADET框架为解决隐式仇恨言论检测问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

TL;DR: MemWeaver是一个将用户文本历史编织成层次化记忆的框架，用于实现深度个性化生成。它通过行为记忆和认知记忆两个互补组件，捕捉用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互方式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本交互，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表进行检索，未能建模反映用户兴趣动态性的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: MemWeaver构建了两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆捕捉具体用户行为，认知记忆表示长期偏好。两者都整合了时间和语义信息，但处于不同的抽象层次。这种双组件记忆作为用户的统一表示，使LLM能够推理具体行为和抽象特征。

Result: 在语言模型个性化基准上的实验验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver通过层次化记忆框架成功捕捉了用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，实现了深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图RAG方法在构建知识图谱时虽然能连接分散的事实，但缺乏深度结构化推理能力，导致复杂多跳问答中证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序的子问题链，为每个子问题从图中检索相关三元组，当现有图谱不足时实时从源文档提取新三元组，并将所有使用的三元组聚合为图记忆。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG实现了持续且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面表现突出。

Conclusion: SubQRAG通过子问题驱动的动态图扩展和结构化证据路径构建，有效提升了复杂多跳问答的推理能力和准确性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Result: 在Hits@1、Hits@3和Hits@10指标上分别比现有最佳MKGC方法提升了5.47%、3.27%和1.01%。实验分析还揭示了在未见语言和不平衡语言设置下知识共享的特性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效利用多语言共享知识显著提升了MKGC性能，证明了跨语言知识共享在多语言知识图谱补全中的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on
https://github.com/gaoxiaofei07/KL-GMoE.

TL;DR: ToolExpander框架通过动态多轮硬采样和自示例思考两个创新，解决了小规模LLM在GRPO训练中响应不准确和训练崩溃的问题，显著提升了工具使用能力和训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小规模LLM在GRPO训练中响应不准确、性能提升有限、训练崩溃等问题，提升资源受限LLM的工具使用能力。

Method: 1. 动态多轮硬采样：用高质量少样本演示动态替换困难样本，结合指数学习率衰减；2. 自示例思考：去除KL散度，调整裁剪系数，通过额外奖励激励模型自主生成分析示例。

Result: ToolExpander显著增强了LLM的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander框架有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键挑战，为资源受限LLM的工具导向强化学习提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

TL;DR: OpenRubrics是一个大规模(prompt, rubric)对集合，通过对比式rubric生成方法，结合显式约束和隐式原则，提升奖励模型的可靠性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型主要依赖标量或成对判断，无法捕捉人类偏好的多维度特性。rubrics-as-rewards方法虽然能提供结构化评估标准，但在可靠性和可扩展性方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出对比式rubric生成(CRG)，通过对比偏好和被拒绝的响应来推导硬规则和原则；使用拒绝采样确保偏好标签一致性，去除噪声rubrics；构建OpenRubrics大规模数据集。

Result: Rubric-RM在多个奖励建模基准上比同规模基线提升6.8%；在指令跟随和生物医学基准上，策略模型也表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: rubrics提供了可扩展的对齐信号，缩小了昂贵的人工评估与自动化奖励建模之间的差距，为LLM对齐开启了新的原则驱动范式。

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 本研究为潜在推理模型实现了并行测试时扩展，通过引入蒙特卡洛Dropout和高斯噪声两种采样策略，以及设计潜在奖励模型来评分和指导潜在推理，在连续空间中开启了可扩展推理的新方向。


<details>

Motivation: 现有并行测试时扩展方法主要针对显式思维链，而潜在推理模型在连续向量空间中进行中间推理，是否也能从并行TTS中受益仍是一个开放问题，主要由于连续空间缺乏采样机制和概率信号。

Method: 提出了两种不确定性启发的随机采样策略：蒙特卡洛Dropout和加性高斯噪声；设计了通过逐步对比目标训练的潜在奖励模型来评分和指导潜在推理。

Result: 实验和可视化分析表明，两种采样策略都能有效随计算规模扩展并展示不同的探索动态，而潜在奖励模型能够实现有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向，通过解决采样和聚合问题，成功实现了潜在推理模型的并行测试时扩展。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究LLMs在选择题回答中仅凭选项就能成功是否真的存在问题，以及推理轨迹是否能揭示这些策略的实质。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅选项输入下解决选择题，分析推理轨迹的长度和忠实性，测试推理对准确率的影响。

Result: 测试时推理在完整输入和约半数的仅选项情况下提升准确率；仅选项成功几乎不受推理轨迹长度影响；推理轨迹通过忠实性测试，显示使用了推断缺失问题等较不问题策略。

Conclusion: 部分输入成功并不总是缺陷，推理轨迹可用于区分问题性数据和较不问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将大量特定问题工具转化为少量功能强大的聚合工具而不损失功能性，有效解决了工具库扩展时的检索挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

TL;DR: 该论文指出基于结果的奖励在数学推理任务中容易导致奖励黑客攻击，造成模型能力的高估。作者提出过程导向的Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，通过评估整个推理轨迹来减少虚假正确解，显著提升模型可靠性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于结果的奖励方法在数学推理任务中存在严重问题，导致大量虚假正确解（正确结果但错误推理过程），高估模型真实推理能力。需要开发过程导向的奖励机制来确保推理的严谨性。

Method: 提出Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，这是一种过程导向的奖励函数，基于问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理轨迹，提供细粒度校准奖励(0-1)，明确惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，RRM训练持续优于仅基于结果的监督方法。在AIME2024上将Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升至62.6%，奇迹步骤发生率减少71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建不仅更准确而且更可靠的模型至关重要。过程导向的奖励机制能有效减少虚假正确解，提升模型推理的严谨性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

TL;DR: 提出了一种旋转约束补偿方法来解决大语言模型结构化剪枝引入的误差，通过保持输出表示的几何特性并重新对齐剪枝子空间，结合方差感知重要性评分，有效补偿误差同时保留重要组件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在剪枝时通常仅使用少量校准数据，导致输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合容易过拟合校准集，破坏预训练权重，需要一种能保持表示几何特性的补偿方法。

Method: 在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数，保持输出表示的范数和内积不变，同时重新对齐剪枝子空间与原始输出。设计方差感知重要性评分，优先保留对输出主方向影响大的维度。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B模型上实验，在WikiText-2和多个语言理解基准测试中，相比现有基线方法，困惑度和任务准确率均表现更优。

Conclusion: 旋转约束补偿方法能有效解决剪枝误差问题，在保持几何特性的同时提升模型性能，为结构化剪枝提供了有效的误差补偿方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To

cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on

Conclusion: AdaSwitch通过动态切换策略同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小型语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Result: 方法将知识准确率从25.14%提升到46.13%，开放理解率从64.5%提升到86.5%，并显著减少了第二语言的发音错误。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了语音-语音交互系统中的语言对齐问题，CS3-Bench基准测试为相关研究提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation
errors in the secondary language. CS3-Bench is available at

TL;DR: 提出ConG框架，通过对比解码前后对齐的弱模型来生成更高质量样本，解决弱到强泛化中的噪声和偏差问题，提升能力转移的可靠性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱到强泛化方法在实际应用中受到弱模型输出噪声和偏差的限制，影响了其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用隐式奖励（通过对数似然比近似显式奖励）与对比解码的结构等价性，提出ConG框架，在前后对齐的弱模型之间进行对比解码来生成更高质量样本。

Result: 在不同模型家族上的实证结果证实了ConG的持续改进，展示了其通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化，为通向AGI提供了一条有前景的途径。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

*Verena Blaschke,Miriam Winkler,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较标准德语到德语方言迁移在文本模型、语音模型和级联系统中的表现，发现语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最佳，级联系统在方言数据上表现相对较好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究标准语到非标准方言的迁移通常关注文本数据，但方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，因此需要比较不同设置下的迁移效果。

Method: 在德语和多个德语方言的书面和口语意图与主题分类背景下，比较文本模型、语音模型以及语音先自动转录再由文本模型处理的级联系统三种设置。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最佳，级联系统在方言数据上表现相对较好，特别是当转录系统生成标准化输出时。

Conclusion: 方言处理中语音模型优于文本模型，级联系统在方言数据上有一定优势，特别是当转录输出标准化时。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

TL;DR: MCBench是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估LLM是否能够严格遵循逐步指令执行字符串匹配NLP指标，提供客观、确定性和可验证的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于前沿LLM在许多先前困难的基准测试上已经饱和，需要更具挑战性的基准测试来提供客观验证。

Method: 通过设计MCBench基准测试，要求LLM严格遵循逐步指令执行字符串匹配NLP指标，并提供并行参考代码来评估LLM输出的准确性。

Result: MCBench作为评估前沿LLM能力的有效客观工具，能够系统测试LLM在逐步执行、指令遵循、数值计算和长范围一致性方面的表现。

Conclusion: MCBench提供了一个客观、确定性和可验证的评估框架，能够有效区分前沿LLM在详细指令理解能力方面的差异。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出ACE框架，通过神经元级归因识别和编辑关键查询-值通路，解决大语言模型在多跳事实回忆中的知识编辑问题，在GPT-J和Qwen3-8B上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实回忆中表现显著下降，特别是在涉及推理链中隐含中间主题时。通过因果分析发现，这是由于忽视了链式知识在神经元层面的动态表示和利用方式。

Method: 提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别关键查询-值通路，并编辑这些通路。该方法基于对推理过程中隐含主题作为查询神经元、依次激活对应值神经元的机制理解。

Result: 在GPT-J上比最先进方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析进一步揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，显示值神经元的语义可解释性由查询驱动积累协调。

Conclusion: 这些发现基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的LLM增强自动评分框架，为各种类型的主观题提供类人评估，通过四个互补模块全面评估学生答案，在多个数据集上表现优于传统和LLM基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主观题自动评分面临挑战，现有方法主要针对特定题型，缺乏支持包含多种题型综合考试的通用性。

Method: 集成四个互补模块：基础文本匹配、LLM提取关键知识点比较、从学生答案生成伪问题评估相关性、模拟人类评估识别内容相关和非内容优缺点。

Result: 在通用和领域特定数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架在多个评分指标上持续优于传统和LLM基线方法，并已成功部署在真实世界的培训和认证考试中。

Conclusion: 提出的统一LLM增强自动评分框架能够有效解决主观题自动评分的挑战，提供类人评估，并在实际应用中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

TL;DR: StepER是一种用于多步检索增强语言模型的知识蒸馏方法，通过步骤监督和难度感知训练来提升推理能力，使8B模型达到与70B教师模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法忽视了不同推理步骤需要不同推理能力的问题，阻碍了多步检索增强框架中的知识迁移。

Method: StepER采用步骤监督来适应不同阶段的信息和推理需求变化，并结合难度感知训练来优先处理合适的步骤，逐步优化学习过程。

Result: 在多项多跳问答基准测试中，StepER优于先前方法，8B模型实现了与70B教师模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: StepER方法能有效提升多步检索增强语言模型的推理能力，且适用于各种多步检索增强框架。

Abstract: Answering complex real-world questions requires step-by-step retrieval and
integration of relevant information to generate well-grounded responses.
However, existing knowledge distillation methods overlook the need for
different reasoning abilities at different steps, hindering transfer in
multi-step retrieval-augmented frameworks. To address this, we propose Stepwise
Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across
stages. Additionally, it incorporates difficulty-aware training to
progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop
QA benchmarks, with an 8B model achieving performance comparable to a 70B
teacher model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型生成文本的完整性，检测缺失信息或未被充分代表的观点，比较三种自动评估方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究三种自动评估策略：基于NLI的方法将文本分解为原子语句并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；基于Q&A的方法提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；端到端方法直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法相比更复杂的方法具有令人惊讶的有效性，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本完整性方面表现突出，但需要在效果与可解释性之间权衡。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

TL;DR: A²Search是一个无需标注的端到端训练框架，用于识别和处理开放域问答中的歧义问题。通过轨迹采样和证据验证自动检测歧义问题并收集替代答案，使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和强化学习方法在开放域问答中表现良好，但在处理允许多个有效答案的歧义问题时仍存在困难。标准问答基准通常假设单一黄金答案，忽略了现实中的歧义性，产生不适当的训练信号。现有处理歧义的方法依赖昂贵的手动标注，难以扩展到多跳数据集。

Method: 提出A²Search框架，核心是自动化流程：通过轨迹采样和证据验证检测歧义问题并收集替代答案，然后使用精心设计的AnsF1奖励进行强化学习优化，自然适应多个答案。

Result: 在八个开放域问答基准测试中，A²Search实现了新的最先进性能。A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中平均AnsF1@1得分48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决歧义问题并在不同基准测试中泛化良好，表明接受歧义对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)与大型语言模型(LLM)之间的行为差异来识别关键推理时刻，通过专家-业余对比构建监督样本，从而高效提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据和均匀优化所有标记，但实际上只有部分标记具有学习价值。本文探索一个反直觉的想法：小型语言模型能否通过揭示反映大型语言模型独特优势的高价值推理时刻来教导大型语言模型。

Method: LightReasoner框架分为两个阶段：(1)采样阶段：通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为对比来识别关键推理时刻，构建捕捉专家优势的监督示例；(2)微调阶段：将专家模型与这些蒸馏的示例对齐，增强其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提高了28.1%，同时减少了90%的时间消耗、80%的采样问题和99%的调优标记使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型语言模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为推进大型语言模型推理提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 该论文发现大语言模型在社交推理任务中存在困难，提出了一种自适应世界模型增强推理机制来解决这一问题，在三个社交基准测试中显著提升了准确性并降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中却表现不佳，经常出现认知混乱、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态的混淆问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混乱指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述及时干预，帮助模型应对认知困境。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中，该机制显著提高了准确性（如在Hi-ToM中提升10%），同时降低了计算成本（最多减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，可用于在社交场景中部署大语言模型，模拟人类如何利用隐式世界模型区分外部事件和内部信念。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学图表标题需要同时具备准确性和文体一致性来传达视觉信息。现有的标题生成方法往往缺乏对作者特定写作风格的适应能力。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：第一阶段结合上下文过滤、使用DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行类别特定提示优化以及标题候选选择；第二阶段应用少样本提示与档案图表进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示方法相比零样本和通用优化方法，将ROUGE-1召回率提高了+8.3%，同时将精度损失限制在-2.8%，BLEU-4减少控制在-10.9%。基于档案的风格精炼使BLEU得分提升40-48%，ROUGE得分提升25-27%。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解与作者特定风格适应的系统能够生成既科学准确又在文体上忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Result: LLMs能捕捉纬度和地形模式，均方根误差3-6°C，偏差±1°C；但在1500米以上海拔性能急剧下降，均方根误差达5-13°C；包含地理背景可平均减少27%误差；模型能捕捉全球平均变暖幅度但无法再现温度变化的空间模式。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能捕捉当前气候分布，但难以表示对理解气候动态至关重要的长期温度变化的区域和局地表达，评估框架为量化LLMs中的参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models
(ORMs) that judge only final answers. Process Reward Models(PRMs) address this
gap by evaluating and guiding reasoning at the step or trajectory level. This
survey provides a systematic overview of PRMs through the full loop: how to
generate process data, build PRMs, and use PRMs for test-time scaling and
reinforcement learning. We summarize applications across math, code, text,
multimodal reasoning, robotics, and agents, and review emerging benchmarks. Our
goal is to clarify design spaces, reveal open challenges, and guide future
research toward fine-grained, robust reasoning alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出FedDTRE，一种基于可信度评估的联邦自适应聚合策略，用于解决联邦学习中对话生成模型的过拟合和遗忘全局信息问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在平衡隐私保护和个性化方面面临挑战，现有联邦学习方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，并在多轮训练后遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE策略，不直接替换本地模型为全局模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度得分，在本地更新时动态调节全局模型的贡献度。

Result: 实验结果表明，FedDTRE能够提高对话模型性能并增强对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估的自适应聚合策略，有效解决了联邦学习中对话生成模型的过拟合和全局信息遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

TL;DR: 研究人类对常识问题答案的合理性判断是否会受到LLM生成的合理性/不合理性论证的影响，发现LLM生成的PRO和CON理由会分别提高和降低人类的合理性评分，表明人类法官认为这些理由具有说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类在常识判断领域是否容易受到LLM生成论证的影响，即使人类被认为是常识领域的"专家"。

Method: 收集了3,000个人类合理性判断和13,600个LLM判断，在提供LLM生成的PRO和CON理由的情况下测试人类和LLM的合理性评分变化。

Result: 在LLM生成的PRO理由存在时，人类平均合理性评分增加；在CON理由存在时，评分降低。LLM实验也显示出类似的受影响模式。

Conclusion: LLMs可以用于研究人类认知方面，但也带来实际担忧：即使在人类是"专家"的常识领域，LLMs也有可能对人们的信念产生相当大的影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's
beliefs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表作为可能的标记集合，它们在下一个标记分布层面（如模型集成）难以相互协作。不同分词方式阻碍了模型间的有效合作。

Method: 建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，能够高效地将给定的自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇量的模型，且不损失任何准确性。

Result: 通过最大公共词汇，展示了具有不同分词方式的语言模型能够有效地相互协作。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架解决了语言模型因不同分词方式而难以协作的问题，为实现模型间的有效合作提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

*Haoyang Gui,Thales Bertaglia,Taylor Annabell,Catalina Goanta,Tjomme Dooper,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较GPT-5-nano和Gemini-2.5-flash-lite在检测未披露赞助内容方面的表现，开发了法律推理错误分类法，发现添加监管文本能提升解释质量但不一定提高检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网红营销模糊了有机内容和赞助内容的界限，使透明度法规执行困难。现有检测方法缺乏法律依据或作为不透明的"黑箱"运作，需要将法律知识应用于监管。

Method: 使用1,143个Instagram帖子，在三种提示策略下比较两个LLM模型，控制法律知识提供水平。开发法律推理错误分类法，结合定量和定性评估策略。

Result: 两个模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1最高0.93），但在模糊案例上性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、模糊引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM生成法律推理常见错误的分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测，并支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

Motivation: 随着LLM作为评估者被大规模使用来增强甚至取代人工标注，理解这种做法的潜在偏见和风险变得至关重要。

Method: 提出了CLoVE算法生成可验证的、基于概念的对比局部解释，以及GloVE算法通过迭代聚类、总结和验证将局部规则浓缩为全局策略。

Result: 在七个标准内容危害检测基准数据集上评估GloVE，发现提取的全局策略对LLM-as-a-Judge的决策具有高度忠实性，并评估了全局策略对文本扰动和对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过用户研究评估了用户对全局策略的理解和满意度，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Motivation: LLM作为自动评估器存在判断偏好偏差，倾向于偏向自身生成的回答，这影响了评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出基于群体的投票优化框架Genii，将多个LLM评估模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟客户端-服务器投票机制进行无监督优化。

Conclusion: Genii能有效缓解LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差，无需人工标注即可改善评估质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误的拒绝，拒绝那些包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求，这影响了模型的实用性和用户体验。

Method: 引入两个综合基准测试：单轮提示的XSB和多轮对话的MS-XSB；利用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发因素；部署三种模型无关的轻量级方法：忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导。

Result: 实验显示这些策略在四个指令调优的Llama模型上显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个可复现的框架来诊断和缓解过度拒绝问题，为更安全和更有用的LLM部署提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有缓解策略通常是启发式和任务特定的，缺乏自适应推理的通用框架。

Method: 提出ARM2统一模型，通过强化学习框架增强长度感知优化，自适应平衡推理性能与效率。整合视觉理解和可执行代码到推理中，扩展多模态应用。

Result: ARM2在性能上与使用GRPO训练的传统推理模型相当，同时平均减少70%以上的token使用。实验验证了模型有效性和设计合理性。

Conclusion: ARM2提供了一个自适应推理的通用框架，在保持性能的同时显著提高效率，支持多模态推理和代码集成，解决了过度思考问题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

Motivation: 现有NLP研究主要关注诗歌自动生成和摘要，而许多语言都有成熟的格律传统，这为深入探究LLM的推理能力和遵循严格规则的能力提供了机会。

Method: 提出了MetricalARGS分类法，将诗歌相关NLP任务分为分析、检索、生成和支持四个维度，讨论了这些任务与现有NLP任务的关系，并解决了数据集和评估指标的问题。

Result: 以泰卢固语为例展示了该分类法的实际应用，证明了通过格律诗歌这一视角可以更好地理解当前LLM的能力和局限性。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS为通过格律诗歌视角理解当今LLM的能力和局限性提供了更广泛的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在预训练中整合知识到记忆、在推理中从记忆检索知识的能力是其成功的关键，但这些记忆检索和巩固机制仍不清楚。

Method: 提出函数令牌假说，通过二分图分析和小型案例研究验证函数令牌激活大多数特征的能力，并分析预训练损失分布。

Result: 实验证据显示少数函数令牌激活大部分特征，函数令牌从上下文中激活最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测，预训练损失主要由预测函数令牌后的内容令牌主导。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解大语言模型的记忆检索和巩固机制提供了新视角，函数令牌在模型推理和训练过程中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在特定领域微调LLMs可能导致广泛的不诚实行为，这种现象在混合任务和实际人机交互中也会出现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在微调恶意或不正确内容后，是否会在高风险场景下表现出广泛的不诚实和欺骗行为。

Method: 在多样化领域对开源LLMs进行错位补全微调，并在下游混合任务和模拟人机交互环境中测试。

Result: LLMs表现出广泛的不诚实行为；仅1%的错位数据可降低诚实行为20%以上；10%的偏见用户群体即可无意中加剧模型的不诚实。

Conclusion: 错位风险不仅通过直接微调产生，也出现在下游混合任务和实际人机交互中，需关注LLMs在高风险场景下的不诚实行为。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the
repository\footnote{https://github.com/gitdevqiang/SenWave}. We anticipate that
this work will foster further exploration into fine-grained sentiment analysis
for complex events within the NLP community, promoting more nuanced
understanding and research innovations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个包含反因果声明的新数据集，解决了现有因果关系提取研究中忽视反因果声明的问题，并证明整合反因果声明能显著提高模型区分正反因果关系的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系提取数据集只关注支持关系的"正因果"声明，完全忽略了反驳关系的"反因果"声明，甚至错误地将反因果标注为正因果。

Method: 通过广泛的文献回顾证明反因果是不完整知识下因果推理的组成部分，制定严格的标注指南，在因果新闻语料库基础上增加反因果声明，获得Cohen's κ=0.74的高标注一致性。

Result: 未训练反因果关系的模型倾向于将反因果错误分类为正因果，而基于新数据集的训练可以缓解这一错误，使transformer模型能有效区分正反因果关系。

Conclusion: 整合反因果声明对于准确的因果关系提取至关重要，新数据集能显著提高模型性能，避免将反因果误判为正因果。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过对话智能体和反馈智能体的协作训练来解决LLM安全对齐问题，在减少不安全回复和过度拒绝方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的安全防护模型往往完全拒绝包含不安全内容的部分，这会加剧过度拒绝问题，且无法为被拒绝的查询提供细致指导。需要一种更协调的方法来平衡帮助性和无害性。

Method: 提出WaltzRL框架，联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，使用动态改进奖励(DIR)机制，基于对话智能体整合反馈的效果进行奖励。推理时，不安全或过度拒绝的回复会被改进而非丢弃。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全回复(如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%)和过度拒绝(OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%)。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，在不降低通用能力的情况下增强了LLM安全性，推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

TL;DR: 该论文研究使用对比解码生成合成数据来增强语言模型训练，通过混合合成数据和真实数据提升语言建模和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能面临枯竭问题，需要探索使用模型自身生成的合成数据作为补充训练资源。

Method: 在控制环境中，使用对比解码方法从好模型和坏模型的相对差异中采样合成语料，然后将合成语料与原始训练数据混合进行训练。

Result: 混合合成数据和真实数据的训练在语言建模目标和多种下游任务上表现更好，对比解码的合成数据对需要推理技能的任务特别有益，而传统采样的合成数据对语言表面能力任务帮助更大。

Conclusion: 使用对比解码生成的合成数据与真实数据混合训练是提升语言模型性能的有效方法，特别能增强模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别了驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，包括文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，这些神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能，但对一般自然语言理解任务影响很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解变得重要。但现有模型存在文化偏见和对代表性不足文化认知有限的问题，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用神经元级分析方法，引入基于梯度的评分方法并进行额外过滤以精确细化，识别文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。通过抑制这些神经元来验证其作用，并分析训练对文化理解的影响。

Result: 识别出的文化相关神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层，仅占所有神经元的不到1%。抑制这些神经元可使文化基准测试性能下降高达30%，而一般自然语言理解任务性能基本不受影响。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 训练自然语言理解基准可能会削弱模型的文化理解能力，特别是当更新包含大量文化通用神经元的模块时。这些发现为理解大语言模型内部机制提供了见解，并为模型训练和工程提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AutoRed是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，通过角色引导的对抗指令生成和反思循环来迭代优化提示质量，并使用验证器评估提示危害性。该方法在攻击成功率和泛化能力上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队方法依赖种子指令，限制了合成对抗提示的语义多样性。为了开发更可靠的人工智能应用，需要提高大型语言模型的安全性评估效果。

Method: AutoRed采用两阶段方法：1）角色引导的对抗指令生成；2）通过反思循环迭代优化低质量提示。为提高效率，引入验证器在不查询目标模型的情况下评估提示危害性。

Result: 构建了两个红队数据集AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard，评估了八个最先进的大型语言模型。AutoRed在攻击成功率和泛化能力上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式的红队测试在大型语言模型安全性评估方面具有潜力。研究结果将开源相关数据集。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构用于自杀风险检测，第一阶段用轻量BERT处理明确信号，第二阶段用LLM投票或基于心理特征的ML集成处理模糊信号，在效率和准确性上取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球自杀率上升，社交媒体提供重要信号，但现有模型难以检测隐晦的自杀意念。轻量模型无法处理隐晦信号，而大语言模型计算成本过高。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段BERT分类器处理高置信度明确案例；第二阶段模糊输入升级到多视角LLM投票框架或基于LLM提取心理特征的ML集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上优于单模型基线，明确案例F1达98.0%，隐晦案例99.7%，跨域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在自杀风险检测中平衡了效率和鲁棒性，首次将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀风险检测。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习（ICL）中表示和学习两个方面的独立性，发现演示的表示决定ICL的基线准确率，而学习从额外演示中提升性能，两者相对独立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示方式的影响，但对ICL学习能力的研究结果不一。本文旨在深入探讨ICL中表示和学习两个方面的交互关系。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集（表示），然后对每个标签集使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 无论标签集质量如何，学习都会发生，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数数量的共同影响。标签集质量的相对优势在学习过程中基本保持不变。

Conclusion: ICL中演示表示和学习效果是相对独立的，表示决定基线性能，学习在此基础上提升性能。这一发现揭示了ICL中一个未被充分探索的方面。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型对条件语句可接受性的判断，发现模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但不如人类一致，且模型规模增大并不一定更接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前的研究主要关注LLMs如何从条件语句中推理，不清楚它们如何判断条件语句的可接受性。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，研究了不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: 模型对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs整合概率和语义线索不如人类一致；更大的模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在判断条件语句可接受性时能够考虑概率和语义因素，但与人类相比存在不一致性，模型规模增加并不保证更好的对齐。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Motivation: 重新思考当前深度学习范式和相关的扩展定律，探索更高效的预训练方法。

Method: 使用单层、两个注意力头和800万参数的Co⁴模型，采用近似O(N)的计算复杂度（N为输入token数），在1000万token上进行训练。

Result: Co⁴在SuperGLUE任务的零样本和微调评估中表现优异：零样本下在7个指标中5个超越GPT-2，4个超越GPT-BERT；微调时在7个任务中6个超越GPT-2，4个超越GPT-BERT。

Conclusion: 小规模但高效的模型架构可以超越更大规模的模型，挑战了当前深度学习范式和扩展定律的普遍认知。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two

is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大推理模型在简单问题上产生不必要的冗长推理轨迹，而在困难问题上探索不足导致错过解决方案。需要一种自适应推理方法来平衡推理效率。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：自适应冷启动阶段根据问题难度按比例生成推理轨迹；第二阶段开发自适应熵策略优化，使用高窗口熵标记作为探索触发器，结合分层熵奖励和动态KL控制来决定探索时机和程度。

Result: 在多种数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中，ARES实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理机制有效解决了推理模型在简单和困难问题上的不平衡表现，实现了更高效的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Motivation: AI模型应该被训练以认识人类判断中的变异和分歧，并评估其识别这种变异的能力。LEWIDI系列任务旨在通过提供合适的数据集和开发评估方法来促进这种训练和评估方法。

Method: 扩展LEWIDI基准到四个数据集（释义识别、反讽检测、讽刺检测和自然语言推理），引入序数判断和两种评估范式：软标签方法（预测群体级判断分布）和视角主义方法（预测个体注释者的解释），测试新的评估指标。

Result: 任务吸引了多样化的参与，结果揭示了建模变异方法的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架的能力，并为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行扩展虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但存在严重的计算效率问题——超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，造成大量计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含：1）使用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型，从部分推理轨迹准确预测答案等价性（AUROC达0.87）；2）在线贪心聚类算法，动态剪枝冗余路径同时保持答案多样性。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试（AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA）和多个推理模型上的评估显示，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样在大多数情况下实现了超过80%的token减少，同时保持准确性在3个百分点以内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

### [156] [Neologism Learning for Controllability and Self-Verbalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08506)
*John Hewitt,Oyvind Tafjord,Robert Geirhos,Been Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过引入新词来理解和控制LLM的方法，称为新词学习。该方法通过添加新词嵌入并训练相关概念示例，实现对模型概念的控制和理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类创造新词表达新概念的启发，探索通过引入新词来更好地理解和控制语言模型，扩展最近提出的新词学习方法。

Method: 通过添加新词嵌入并训练包含该概念的示例，不改变其他模型参数。引入插件评估来验证模型自我描述的含义，并探索多概念联合学习。

Result: 新词可以控制奉承、错误答案、文本长度等概念，以及AxBench中的复杂概念。模型能够用自然语言描述新词含义，并发现机器专用同义词。

Conclusion: 新词学习为理解和控制语言模型提供了有效途径，能够实现概念控制、自我描述和多概念联合学习。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

### [157] [Which Heads Matter for Reasoning? RL-Guided KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08525)
*Wenjie Du,Li Jiang,Keda Tao,Xue Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RLKV框架，使用强化学习识别推理关键注意力头，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持推理质量的同时减少20-50%缓存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在处理推理模型时表现不佳：token丢弃方法会破坏推理完整性，而头重分配方法错误压缩了推理关键头，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出RLKV框架，利用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量之间的关系，识别推理关键头，为关键头分配完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩的常量KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，该方法在实现20-50%缓存减少的同时，性能接近无压缩结果，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RLKV通过识别推理关键头实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，解决了现有方法在推理模型上的局限性，为大规模语言模型的推理部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

TL;DR: CoMAS是一个多智能体协同进化框架，通过智能体间的互动讨论生成内在奖励，实现无外部监督的自主改进，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的方法要么依赖外部密集奖励信号，要么从LLM自身提取内在奖励，这与人类通过相互讨论和协作实现自我进化的机制不符。

Method: CoMAS通过智能体间的丰富讨论动态生成内在奖励，采用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略，实现去中心化和可扩展的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果表明CoMAS始终优于未经训练的智能体，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。消融研究证实了基于互动的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加而具有良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自我进化建立了一个新颖有效的范式，通过多智能体协同互动实现自主改进。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

*Qin Liu,Jacob Dineen,Yuxi Huang,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Ben Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的自动基准演化框架，通过迭代更新测试用例来解决LLM基准测试中的数据泄露问题，保持可比性的同时提高测试难度和模型区分度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于预训练语料库中的数据泄露问题，现有基准测试的有效性受到威胁，模型可能通过记忆而非真正泛化来匹配内容，导致分数虚高、跨模型比较失真和进展误判。

Method: 给定现有基准和待评估模型池，ArenaBencher推断每个测试案例的核心能力，生成保持原始目标的候选问答对，使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图，并聚合多个模型的反馈来选择暴露共同弱点的候选案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用显示，ArenaBencher能产生经过验证、多样化且公平的更新，发现新的失败模式，在保持测试目标对齐的同时增加难度，并改善模型区分度。

Conclusion: 该框架为持续演化基准测试提供了可扩展路径，使其能够与基础模型的快速进展同步发展。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

### [160] [Local MAP Sampling for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07343)
*Shaorong Zhang,Rob Brekelmans,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了局部最大后验采样（LMAPS）方法，为基于优化的扩散求解器提供统一的概率解释框架，在图像恢复和科学任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散后验采样（DPS）虽然提供了贝叶斯方法，但实际逆问题求解的目标是获得最准确的重建，而基于优化的扩散求解器往往表现更好但缺乏明确的概率基础。

Method: 引入LMAPS框架，通过沿扩散轨迹迭代求解局部最大后验子问题，开发了具有概率可解释性的协方差近似、稳定性目标重表述和非可微算子的梯度近似。

Result: 在广泛的图像恢复和科学任务中，LMAPS实现了最先进的性能，包括在运动去模糊、JPEG恢复和量化上获得≥2dB增益，在逆散射基准上获得>1.5dB改进。

Conclusion: LMAPS为基于优化的扩散方法提供了统一的概率解释，显著提升了逆问题求解的性能，并在多个任务中取得了突破性成果。

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically
interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability
and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable
operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion
deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on
inverse scattering benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可微分变量字体框架，将变量字体参数与底层矢量图形进行可微分连接，实现了基于梯度的字体设计和动画优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前变量字体在创意应用中未充分利用，艺术家仍需手动调整字体参数。需要自动化字体设计和动画工作流程，同时保持文本的可读性和美观性。

Method: 将变量字体规范提炼为紧凑的数学公式，可微分地连接变量字体参数与底层矢量图形的非线性映射。构建可微分框架，支持基于梯度的优化。

Result: 开发了四个应用：直接形状操作、重叠感知建模、基于物理的文本动画和自动字体设计优化。

Conclusion: 该框架使得能够利用变量字体精心设计的特性与现代设计优化技术，为简单直观的排版设计工作流程开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Editing and animating text appearance for graphic designs, commercials, etc.
remain highly skilled tasks requiring detailed, hands on efforts from artists.
Automating these manual workflows requires balancing the competing goals of
maintaining legibility and aesthetics of text, while enabling creative
expression. Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts,
offer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and
animation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which
fonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially
serve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated
design optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized
in creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune
font parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design
and animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill
the current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation
that differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of
variable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the
text. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to
variable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of
energies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized
images. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with four applications:
direct shape manipulation, overlap aware modeling, physics based text
animation, and automated font design optimization. Our work now enables
leveraging the carefully designed affordances of variable fonts with
differentiability to use modern design optimization technologies, opening new
possibilities for easy and intuitive typographic design workflows.

### [162] [Variable-Rate Texture Compression: Real-Time Rendering with JPEG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08166)
*Elias Kristmann,Markus Schütz,Michael Wimmer*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文研究了在现代GPU上使用JPEG格式进行可变速率纹理压缩的可行性，并与固定速率压缩方法BC1和ASTC进行比较。通过延迟渲染管线，能够识别所需块并解码，在RTX 4090上仅增加0.3ms渲染时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然可变速率压缩图像格式如JPEG被广泛用于高效编码图像，但由于需要随机访问单个纹理像素等特殊要求，它们尚未在实时渲染中找到应用。

Method: 使用延迟渲染管线识别给定帧所需的块子集，解码这些块，并为帧缓冲区的像素着色。

Result: 尽管需要额外的约0.17位每像素，JPEG在质量和压缩率方面显著优于BC1，并且根据图像类型，优于或与ASTC竞争。JPEG渲染管线在RTX 4090上仅增加不到0.3ms的渲染时间。

Conclusion: 复杂的可变速率压缩方案在现代GPU上是可行的，即使在VR环境中也是如此。

Abstract: Although variable-rate compressed image formats such as JPEG are widely used
to efficiently encode images, they have not found their way into real-time
rendering due to special requirements such as random access to individual
texels. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture
compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the
GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred
rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are
needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels.
Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our
approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates
compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes
with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less
than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate
compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR. Source code and

Motivation: 现有方法要么使用简单材质模型，要么需要额外步骤估计反射率，无法直接实现重光照和可控外观编辑。

Method: 扩展潜在视频扩散模型，基于显式相机控制联合输出空间变化的PBR参数和表面法线，并引入多种机制改进这个不适定设置下的质量。

Result: 在多个以物体为中心的数据集上展示了最先进的重光照和新视角合成性能，能够泛化到多样化输入。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成适用于AR/VR、电影、游戏等视觉媒体的可重光照3D资产。

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

TL;DR: X2Video是首个基于内在通道（反照率、法线、粗糙度、金属度、辐照度）引导的扩散模型，可生成逼真视频，支持参考图像和文本提示的多模态控制，并采用混合自注意力、掩码交叉注意力和递归采样技术确保时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视频生成中时间一致性和多模态控制的问题，特别是如何准确操纵颜色、材质、几何和光照，同时支持直观的全局和局部编辑。

Method: 扩展XRGB图像生成模型到视频生成，采用混合自注意力确保时间一致性，掩码交叉注意力分离全局和局部文本提示，递归采样方法结合关键帧预测和帧插值生成长视频。

Result: X2Video能够生成长时间一致、逼真的视频，有效支持多模态控制，包括参考图像、全局和局部文本提示，并支持颜色、材质、几何和光照的参数化编辑。

Conclusion: X2Video通过内在通道引导和多模态控制，实现了高质量、时间一致的视频生成，为视频编辑和生成提供了强大的工具。

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经语言模型生成内容与知识库不一致的问题，减少幻觉现象，同时保持模型效率。

Method: 基于概率程序语义学，在指令调优系统中引入语义防护格，包括约束语义、贪婪选择证明、熵式不变性和多智能体操作演算。

Result: 案例研究证实防护机制能有效减少幻觉，在保持吞吐量的前提下提升生成内容的真实性。

Conclusion: TAD 为大规模经验模型与形式验证之间提供了实用的桥梁，实现了知识感知的安全生成。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

Motivation: 当前静态的心理健康诊断解决方案无法满足动态思维的需求，神经心理学领域存在能力限制，需要更个性化、纵向的护理方法来提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Method: 提出使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生作为持续更新的计算模型框架。

Result: AI驱动的连续评估能够捕获个体症状动态和轨迹，为个性化心理健康护理提供丰富、以患者为中心的数据支持。

Conclusion: 通过AI驱动的连续评估和心理健康数字孪生框架，可以实现动态适应个体患者需求和不断变化的条件，从而改善心理健康护理的可及性和疗效。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应和人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Conclusion: 本文为医疗智能系统的伦理风险管理提供了数学建模和多种求解方法的比较分析，为构建完整的可信AI伦理风险管理流程奠定了基础。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trust- worthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Pro- gramming(CP).Our contributions
include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling
with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental
study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each
ap- proach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw
some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model
into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

### [170] [CompassLLM: A Multi-Agent Approach toward Geo-Spatial Reasoning for Popular Path Query](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07516)
*Md. Nazmul Islam Ananto,Shamit Fatin,Mohammed Eunus Ali,Md Rizwan Parvez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现热门路径，包含搜索现有路径和生成新路径两个阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统算法和机器学习方法在热门路径查询中需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将其应用于地理空间问题具有重要意义。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，包含两个阶段：SEARCH阶段识别现有热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争力，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功地将大语言模型的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为热门路径查询提供了一种有效且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

TL;DR: RECAP是一个混合框架，结合确定性正则表达式和上下文感知大语言模型，用于在13种低资源语言中检测个人身份信息(PII)，在加权F1分数上比微调NER模型高82%，比零样本LLM高17%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言中的PII检测面临语言多样性和标注数据有限的挑战，需要可扩展的解决方案来满足隐私合规要求。

Method: 采用混合框架，结合确定性正则表达式和上下文感知LLM，使用三阶段精炼管道进行消歧和过滤，模块化设计支持300多种实体类型而无需重新训练。

Result: 使用nervaluate基准测试，系统在加权F1分数上比微调NER模型高出82%，比零样本LLM高出17%。

Conclusion: RECAP为合规应用中的PII检测提供了一个可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: The detection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is critical for
privacy compliance but remains challenging in low-resource languages due to
linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. We present RECAP, a hybrid
framework that combines deterministic regular expressions with context-aware
large language models (LLMs) for scalable PII detection across 13 low-resource
locales. RECAP's modular design supports over 300 entity types without
retraining, using a three-phase refinement pipeline for disambiguation and
filtering. Benchmarked with nervaluate, our system outperforms fine-tuned NER
models by 82% and zero-shot LLMs by 17% in weighted F1-score. This work offers
a scalable and adaptable solution for efficient PII detection in
compliance-focused applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI市场快速扩张，但现有评估方法存在数据污染、选择性报告等严重漏洞，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，损害科学信号和公众信任。

Method: 分析当前AI评估的系统性缺陷，提炼新一代评估的基本要求，并提出PeerBench框架，包含密封执行、题库滚动更新和延迟透明等机制。

Result: 提出了一个社区治理、监考评估的蓝图，通过密封执行、题库银行和延迟透明度等设计，构建更可靠的AI评估体系。

Conclusion: 当前放任自流的AI评估方法不可持续，需要转向统一、实时、质量可控的基准测试框架，以恢复评估的完整性并提供真正可信的AI进展衡量标准。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过在智能体间消息传递时插入必要的问题来阻止错误传播，显著提升多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持低开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过协作分工有望增强问题解决能力，但由于边缘级错误级联（一个消息传递中的小错误会传播到整个链）而经常表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: AgentAsk采用三阶段流程：(i)从整理的失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，(ii)监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问，(iii)使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化，平衡准确性、延迟和成本。该模块与架构无关，易于集成到现有编排中。

Result: 在数学、推理和编码基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提高公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持开销最小，延迟和额外成本均低于5%，接近强评估器的性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的原理性分类和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统虽然能自动化复杂软件任务，但由于错误会在各阶段间悄无声息地传递，导致系统难以信任。需要建立可追溯和问责的流水线机制。

Method: 采用Planner->Executor->Critic三层流水线结构，在三个基准测试上评估了8种配置的三种最先进LLM，分析错误起源、传播路径和修复方法。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 添加结构化、可问责的交接机制显著提高准确性；(2) 模型在特定角色中表现出明显优势；(3) 准确性-成本-延迟权衡是任务相关的，异构流水线通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的、数据驱动的方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测且可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Result: 生成式AI成功提升了退伍军人心理健康支持培训的效果，证明了其在培训领域的可行性和有效性。

Conclusion: 应该优先投资于使用生成式AI来支持心理健康服务提供者的培训，这比直接应用于治疗聊天机器人更安全且影响更大。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，现有评估指标可能系统性低估模型能力，需要更准确的评估方法和性能提升技术。

Method: 引入组匹配评分方法，利用组结构更好地评估模型能力；提出测试时匹配算法，通过迭代自改进在测试时提升模型性能。

Result: 新方法显著提升了模型性能：SigLIP-B16超越所有先前结果和GPT-4，GPT-4.1首次超越人类在Winoground上的表现；测试时匹配算法在16个数据集上持续改进性能，相对增益高达85.7%。

Conclusion: 现有评估指标确实系统性低估了AI模型的组合推理能力，通过改进评估方法和测试时优化技术，可以显著提升模型性能，推动组合推理前沿的发展。

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品不断添加，现有离线策略学习方法在探索新动作时存在安全隐患

Method: 开发Safe OPG（基于高置信度离线策略评估的模型无关方法）和DEPLOY框架（利用安全边际并逐步放松安全正则化）

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；DEPLOY框架在多次部署中实现安全探索

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时探索新动作

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监控的奖励生成方法，用于强化学习中控制策略的自动合成，解决了现有方法中全局奖励稀疏导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实时安全关键CPS中，控制合成必须保证策略在不确定动态条件下满足严格的时序和正确性要求。现有STL引导的RL方法使用全局评估的稀疏奖励，可能导致训练不收敛和不稳定。

Method: 提出在线奖励生成方法，通过在每个控制步骤连续监控系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的定量距离，生成反映瞬时状态动态的奖励。同时提供因果语义的平滑近似以克服不连续性。

Result: 在Gym环境中对多种连续控制基准进行实验评估，结果显示该方法在稳健性和效率上优于现有相关STL引导的RL方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为深度强化学习提供了一个更稳健高效的奖励生成框架，能够有效解决STL引导RL中的训练稳定性问题。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在化学任务如合成设计方面显示出潜力，但尚不清楚这种能力在多大程度上反映了真正的化学推理能力，即生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步骤路径的能力。

Method: 引入了oMeBench基准数据集和oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分。分析了最先进的大型语言模型性能，并探索了提示策略和微调方法。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步骤推理方面存在困难。通过提示策略和在所提数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先的闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench将为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供严格的基础，当前模型在化学机制推理方面仍有改进空间，但通过专门的数据集和评估方法可以显著提升性能。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合层次化引用图来生成更全面、结构更好的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的综述生成方法通常直接从大量相关论文中提取内容进行总结，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合层次化引用图（节点为研究论文，边捕捉引用依赖和语义相关性），将图组织为Foundation、Development和Frontier三层，通过层内水平搜索和跨层垂直遍历生成多级摘要，并经过多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG在人类专家和LLM作为评判者的评估中均优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化和上下文知识，能够生成质量更高的综述论文，为自动化综述生成提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Motivation: 现有的图域适应方法严重依赖源域数据，但在实际应用中由于隐私或安全问题，源域数据往往不可用。这推动了测试时图域适应的发展，旨在不访问源域示例的情况下实现知识迁移。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架：首先将节点表示压缩为紧凑的潜在特征，使用图扩散过程建模图恢复过程；然后通过量化模块将恢复特征编码为离散标记；最后微调LLM作为生成式恢复器，将"噪声"目标图转换为"原生"图，并通过强化学习过程使用对齐和置信度奖励进一步提高恢复质量。

Conclusion: 通过将测试时图域适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，并利用大语言模型的生成能力，GRAIL框架能够在不访问源域数据的情况下有效解决域偏移问题。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

TL;DR: ACONIC框架通过将任务建模为约束问题并利用形式复杂性度量来指导分解，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务上存在可靠性问题，现有分解方法都是启发式的，依赖智能体或手动分解，缺乏系统性。

Method: 提出ACONIC框架，将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式复杂性度量来指导任务分解。

Result: 在组合优化任务(SATBench)和LLM数据库查询任务(Spider)上，通过基于复杂性度量的分解，智能体性能显著提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: 基于约束诱导复杂性的分析方法为LLM在复杂任务上的分解提供了系统性的解决方案，能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

TL;DR: 本文提出了Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO等强化学习算法在推理任务中的局限性，显著提升了小模型在推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型生成回答的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全错或全对的样本中学习知识。这限制了小模型推理能力的提升。

Method: GCPO方法引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案为模型提供正确答案，引导模型朝着明确正确的更新方向学习。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO方法不仅提高了训练效率，充分利用每个样本，还使模型能够模仿参考答案的解题策略，从而增强了推理的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 对抗环境中存在关键战略权衡：获取信息增强态势感知，但通信可能暴露自身位置增加风险。需要研究这种信息获取与风险暴露的平衡问题。

Method: 提出SHADOW多头部序贯强化学习框架，集成连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模，通过强化学习同时学习移动和通信策略。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线实现了更高的成功率，消融研究证实时间序列建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下具有良好的泛化能力，证明了SHADOW框架在对抗环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架通过步进式混合奖励机制有效解决了电商搜索相关性分析中的关键挑战，为AI驱动的电商搜索提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在处理数值时存在非连续性和噪声问题，尽管能够高精度重建数值，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与简单数值输入空间正交，且精度增加时线性重建和解释方差会恶化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续，以及评估其数值表示的质量，特别是在高精度、大数值或混合符号值等常见应用场景中。

Method: 使用来自OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI的模型，通过线性重建和主成分分析来评估嵌入空间的预期属性，包括线性重建能力和主成分解释方差的比例。

Result: 研究发现虽然重建可以达到高保真度（R²≥0.95），但主成分仅能解释嵌入空间变化的一小部分，表明许多嵌入空间组件与简单数值输入空间正交。此外，随着十进制精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型不仅将数值空间表示为非连续的，还引入了显著噪声，这对许多使用嵌入模型的领域具有重要影响，特别是在需要高数值精度、大数值或混合符号值的场景中。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过在不同推理阶段施加不同的熵约束来控制大型推理模型的响应长度，在保持准确性的同时显著缩短推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。控制生成推理长度而不牺牲准确性是一个开放挑战。

Method: 通过系统性实证分析发现模型熵与响应长度存在正相关关系，基于此提出PEAR奖励机制，在思考阶段惩罚过高熵值，在最终答案阶段允许适度探索，从而自适应控制响应长度。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确性，并展现出超出训练分布的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR通过阶段依赖的熵控制实现了推理长度的自适应调节，为平衡推理模型的简洁性和性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来解决LoRA在参数高效微调中的性能次优和收敛慢问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然在实际部署中取得了显著成功，但仍面临性能次优和收敛速度慢的挑战。研究发现自注意力机制中的W^Q和W^V投影矩阵具有不同的参数特性，这源于它们的功能差异。

Method: AILoRA引入函数感知的非对称低秩先验，对W^Q注入其主要成分以保留任务自适应能力，对W^V注入其次要成分以保持可泛化的特征表示。

Result: 这种非对称初始化策略使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过利用W^Q和W^V的功能差异，实现了更有效的参数高效微调，解决了LoRA的局限性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，通过反馈校准模块提高生成精度，利用场景描述和自动驾驶模型约束对抗性车辆行为，实现自然语言到闭环交互模拟的转换。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的多样化关键性场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述ACT：3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其精炼模块有效降低了初始输出的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim通过弥合自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距，促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了安全测试和训练能力。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Motivation: 在线评论质量评估对电商平台和信息服务至关重要，但质量是领域依赖且动态变化的概念。传统方法依赖手工特征，无法跨领域扩展且难以适应内容模式变化；现代深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且可能过度关注语义而非质量。

Method: AutoQual模拟人类研究过程，通过反思迭代生成特征假设，通过自主工具实现操作化，并在持久内存中积累经验。该框架将数据中的隐性知识转化为显性、可计算的特征。

Result: 在大规模在线平台（拥有十亿级用户基础）上部署，大规模A/B测试证实其有效性：每位用户平均查看评论数增加0.79%，评论阅读者的转化率提高0.27%。

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估中的可扩展性、适应性和可解释性问题，为将隐性知识转化为显性特征提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地融入AI驱动的决策支持系统，理解它们的风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要。需要防止AI系统无意中引导用户做出风险决策或嵌入隐藏的偏见。

Method: 研究语言模型在不同经济场景下复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策以及风险厌恶的可操纵性。

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型与人类行为有一定一致性，但存在显著差异，突显了改进生物中心可操纵性测量的必要性。

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提高在风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性。

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: 提出了R-HORIZON方法来评估和增强大型推理模型的长视野推理能力，通过查询组合构建多步骤推理任务，发现现有模型在长视野推理中存在显著性能下降，并利用该方法生成数据通过强化学习提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂长视野场景的能力，需要更全面的评估方法来测试大型推理模型的长视野推理能力。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激大型推理模型的长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步骤推理任务的长视野推理基准，并利用该基准生成数据用于带验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）。

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的大型推理模型在长视野推理任务中也出现显著性能下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和跨问题思考预算分配困难。RLVR与R-HORIZON训练相比单视野数据训练，不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还提高了标准推理任务的准确率，AIME2024上提升7.5分。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估大型推理模型的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了锦标赛树方法(TTM)，一种新颖的偏好获取和评估框架，只需要m-1次成对比较就能获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，显著降低了认知负担和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的成对比较方法如模糊偏好关系和Saaty乘法偏好关系存在高认知负担、不一致性风险和计算复杂性问题，限制了它们在多准则决策中的应用。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的针对性比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。该方法通过设计确保一致性，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数。

Result: 该方法能够获得完整、互反且一致的比较矩阵，与经典卡片法兼容，可以处理区间和比率尺度，并开发了基于Web的工具展示其实际应用性。

Conclusion: 锦标赛树方法通过设计确保一致性，显著减少了认知负担和计算复杂度，为多准则决策提供了一种高效实用的偏好建模方法。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果理解能力。让AI具备因果意识可以提升其对环境机制的理解，从而改善性能。

Method: 智能体通过重复干预与环境交互，利用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性，自主推断隐藏的因果有向无环图结构。

Result: 在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下，DODO表现优于观测方法，通常能以接近零误差重建因果图结构，在最具挑战性配置中比最佳基线高出0.25个F1点。

Conclusion: DODO算法证明了通过主动干预学习因果结构的有效性，为AI系统提供因果理解能力，在噪声环境下仍能准确推断因果机制。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松解决推理任务，但现有的大语言模型即使在大量预训练和后训练后仍无法可靠地进行推理。论文旨在从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，并为解决其挑战提供见解。

Method: 将推理任务建模为选择机制，其中高层逻辑概念作为选择算子作用于给定观察。提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反思表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐，通过估计的潜在变量反馈来促进潜在表示间密集依赖关系的学习。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上带来显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，相比最新进展，使用8倍更少的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务形式化为选择机制，并提出的SR²框架能有效学习潜在表示间的密集依赖关系，显著提升推理任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对LLM智能体的多步后门攻击方法CoTri，通过有序触发序列实现长期控制，在保持高攻击成功率的同时提升智能体在良性任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的智能体在现实应用中的快速部署，其安全性和鲁棒性引发了严重担忧。传统后门攻击仅限于单步控制，需要开发能够实现长期智能体控制的多步后门攻击方法。

Method: 提出Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri)方法，使用有序触发序列，从初始触发开始，后续触发从环境中抽取，实现多步操纵，使智能体偏离预定任务。

Result: 实验结果显示CoTri实现了接近完美的攻击成功率(ASR)，同时保持接近零的误触发率(FTR)。由于训练数据建模了环境的随机性，CoTri的植入反而增强了智能体在良性任务上的性能，并提高了对环境干扰的鲁棒性。该方法在视觉语言模型上验证了可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoTri能够在智能体中实现稳定的多步控制，同时提高其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，这使得攻击更加隐蔽，并带来了潜在的安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了大语言模型中的反思行为，发现反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案。作者提出了一种问题感知的早停方法，在生成几个候选答案后动态截断反思，显著减少了推理token数量。

Motivation: 理解反思在语言模型推理能力提升中的实际贡献，以及如何优化推理过程的效率。

Method: 系统分析八个推理模型在五个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步骤的SFT数据集进行训练，并提出问题感知的早停方法。

Result: 反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步骤主要提升首次答案正确率；提出的早停方法减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理中主要起确认作用，通过动态截断反思可以显著提高推理效率，同时保持较高的准确性。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出Cover@τ指标来替代Pass@k，以更准确地评估语言模型在推理任务中的真实能力边界，避免随机猜测带来的误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大采样预算下会高估基础模型的推理边界，因为离散答案空间中大量采样会增加随机猜中的概率，而非反映真实的推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@τ指标，衡量模型在至少τ比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，通过可靠性阈值来区分真实推理和随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@τ评估多个RLVR模型发现，相比Pass@1，模型相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的不同视角。

Conclusion: Cover@τ能更准确地捕捉模型的真实推理能力，避免Pass@k在大采样预算下的误导性评估。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究每年耗费公司数十亿美元，但存在面板偏差和规模限制的问题。大语言模型提供了模拟合成消费者的替代方案，但直接要求数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: SSR方法从LLMs获取文本响应，然后使用嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的李克特分布。在57个个人护理产品调查的广泛数据集上进行测试。

Result: SSR达到90%的人类测试-重测可靠性，同时保持现实的响应分布(KS相似度>0.85)。合成受访者还提供丰富的定性反馈来解释他们的评分。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在保持传统调查指标和可解释性的同时，实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

Motivation: 检测大型语言模型中的幻觉对于可信部署至关重要，现有不确定性驱动的检测框架存在局限，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 通过测量从多个模型输出和不同层中提取的隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示谱分析提供可解释的洞察。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中稳健泛化。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新范式，结合了理论优雅性和实际效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息，特别是在BabyLM挑战赛的视觉赛道约束下。

Method: 采用轻量级解码器架构，包含：(1) 基于token的动态门控机制，自适应融合语言和视觉线索；(2) 特征调制和通道注意力，最大化有限视觉信息的效用；(3) 辅助对比学习目标用于视觉接地。

Result: 在五个基准测试（BLiMP、BLiMP Supplement、EWoK、Winoground和VQA）上表现出竞争性或优于多模态基线。动态门控在没有显式监督的情况下发现了可解释的模式：内容词偏好视觉线索，功能词偏好语言线索。

Conclusion: 尽管存在挑战约束带来的局限性（如全局图像嵌入造成的信息瓶颈和数据集分割导致的训练不稳定），动态门控被证明是高效多模态学习的强大工具，在严格约束下同时提供可解释性和性能。

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

Motivation: 许多任务需要模型在多轮交互中策略性地收集相关信息后再行动，但现有模型缺乏知道何时停止信息收集的能力，容易导致过度思考或偏离主题。

Method: 提出CaRT方法，使用反事实轨迹对（一个终止合适，一个终止不合适）微调LLMs，并通过语言推理训练模型解释终止决策的合理性。

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率。

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效训练LLMs学习何时停止信息收集，提高任务执行效率和成功率。

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at
