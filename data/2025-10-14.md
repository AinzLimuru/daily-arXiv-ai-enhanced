Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer framework, for early detection of Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early MRI signs of Batten disease are subtle and often missed, motivating the development of an AI solution for early detection.

Method: A large teacher ViT is distilled into a 5M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tuned using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with 5-shot episodes).

Result: The model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset.

Conclusion: TinyViT-Batten demonstrates a practical and explainable AI solution for early Batten disease detection with strong performance and small size.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited data availability and data confidence in medical image analysis.

Method: A novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology called TreeNet, integrating pivotal features from neural networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models.

Result: Achieved an F1-score of up to 0.85 with complete training data and 0.77 with 50% of the training data, with a processing speed of 32 frames per second.

Conclusion: TreeNet demonstrates efficiency and usability in medical image analysis, especially in realtime analysis.

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Omni Swift Action Tokenizer (OmniSAT) 的新型动作标记器，旨在提高视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型中自回归(AR)方法的效率。OmniSAT通过学习紧凑且可迁移的动作表示，有效缩短训练序列，并降低目标熵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型，特别是AR模型，在处理长序列和高维度动作时面临效率瓶颈。以往的压缩方法存在重建质量差或压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 该方法首先对值范围和时间范围进行归一化，利用B-Spline编码获得一致的表示。然后，采用多阶段残差量化方法对位置、旋转和夹持器子空间进行处理，生成具有粗到细粒度的压缩离散令牌。

Result: 在Droid数据集上预训练后，OmniSAT将训练序列缩短了6.8倍，降低了目标熵。通过跨具身学习策略，OmniSAT在多种真实机器人和模拟实验中实现了更高的压缩率，同时保持了重建质量，加速了AR训练的收敛和模型性能。

Conclusion: OmniSAT能够有效压缩动作序列，提高AR模型的训练效率和性能，并具有良好的跨具身学习能力。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) model for improved change detection in MODIS time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Change detection using MODIS time series is challenging due to mixed pixels, information coupling, and background class heterogeneity.

Method: The KAMamba model incorporates a knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided approach, a multi-task learning approach with three losses (PreC-loss, PostC-loss, Chg-loss), spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules, and a sparse and deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone.

Result: The method achieves 1.5-6% gains in average F1 for change detection and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification on a MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada.

Conclusion: The proposed KAMamba model enhances MODIS change detection and LULC classification accuracy.

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNDM: Integrates NN-UNet with diffusion models for brain tumor segmentation, enhancing boundary precision and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN models struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and limited data diversity in brain tumor segmentation.

Method: Integrates NN-UNet's feature extraction with diffusion models to refine segmentation masks by learning residual error distribution.

Result: NNDM outperforms U-Net and transformer-based baselines on BraTS 2021, improving Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance.

Conclusion: NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models in brain tumor analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of Multi-View Multi-Camera (MVMC) systems, unifying tracking, re-identification, and action understanding into a single framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenges of deploying Connected Vision Systems (CVS) in real-world environments, which existing surveys often neglect by focusing on isolated tasks and single-view setups.

Method: The paper proposes a unique taxonomy, dividing CVS into MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. It systematically arranges state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics.

Result: The survey identifies open research questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies like lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning.

Conclusion: The paper outlines key research directions for enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex real-world applications, aiming to inspire innovative solutions and guide future research.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [8] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp improves MLLM accuracy by reallocating image resolution to query-relevant regions using cross-modal attention, enhancing fine-grained perception without changing model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often struggle with fine-grained details and spatial relations in complex scenes, leading to errors in perceptual grounding.

Method: AttWarp uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, focusing resolution on important regions while preserving global context.

Result: AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations across five benchmarks and four MLLMs, outperforming other image manipulation baselines.

Conclusion: Attention-guided warping prioritizes query-relevant information while preserving context, leading to better performance from MLLMs when using warped inputs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

Motivation: 探索新的外语学习方法，利用图像和文本的多模态信息辅助生词学习。

Method: 通过人类参与者进行实验，使用不同的图文配对，分析数据特征与参与者语言背景对生词推断的影响。

Result: 仅发现部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，表明需要进一步研究预测任务成功的特征。

Conclusion: 分析了人工智能系统对参与者表现的推理能力，并发现了提高这种推理能力的潜在方向。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

*Weiqing Luo,Zhen Tan,Yifan Li,Xinyu Zhao,Kwonjoon Lee,Behzad Dariush,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing VLLMs use fixed resolution, leading to subpar performance. This paper proposes a method to determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task and a fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing VLLMs pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to subpar performance.

Method: Conduct a comprehensive investigation into the resolution preferences of different vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image input resolutions. Propose an empirical formula to determine the optimal resolution. Propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution.

Result: Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: The proposed method can improve the performance of VLLMs on various vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 研究使用合成面部数据增强单人脸融合攻击检测 (S-MAD)，解决由于隐私问题导致的大规模真实图像数据集可用性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实人脸图像数据集的隐私问题和数据稀缺性，探索合成数据在提升人脸融合攻击检测中的潜力。

Method: 利用多种融合工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议，评估随着更多合成图像的添加，模型的泛化能力。

Result: 结果表明，通过谨慎地将受控数量的合成图像整合到现有数据集中，或在训练过程中逐步添加真实图像，可以提高泛化能力。然而，不加选择地使用合成数据可能导致次优性能。仅使用合成数据会获得最高的等错误率 (EER)，这意味着在实际操作场景中，最佳选择不是仅依赖合成数据进行 S-MAD。

Conclusion: 谨慎使用合成数据可以提高单人脸融合攻击检测的泛化能力，但不能完全依赖合成数据。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的像素聚类方法Ceb，利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素划分为细胞实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的细胞实例分割方法依赖于像素级的目标，可能丢失细胞实例的几何属性。

Method: Ceb首先提取潜在的前景-前景边界，然后构建边界特征表示（称为边界签名），并使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签。最后，通过基于预测的边界标签分割或合并相邻区域来获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的大量实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法。此外，与SOTA细胞实例分割方法相比，Ceb实现了极具竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb是一种有效的细胞实例分割方法，可以利用细胞边界特征和标签来提高分割性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

### [14] [Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning for Few-Shot Vision-Language Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09867)
*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) to improve VLM zero-shot transfer by preserving the cluster nature of context prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional prompt ensembling in VLMs, which averages textual features, leads to suboptimal results by shifting class centroids.

Method: CAPEL classifies images into class clusters represented by distinct prompts and ensembles in the logits space. It also uses cluster-preserving regularization and adaptive prompt weighting.

Result: The paper demonstrates improved performance across datasets and tasks using CAPEL.

Conclusion: CAPEL enhances VLM performance by preserving cluster structure in prompts and ensembling in the logits space, offering a robust approach to zero-shot transfer.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新的多目标跟踪（MOT）方法，该方法利用自监督编码器融合深度和掩码特征以产生稳定的对象表示，从而改进对象关联，尤其是在对象相似或遮挡的情况下，且避免了计算量大的掩码IoU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MOT方法依赖于IoU进行关联，但在对象相似或遮挡时变得不可靠，且分割掩码的IoU计算量大。

Method: 该方法融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督训练的紧凑编码器生成稳定的对象表示，并将其作为额外的相似性线索，结合边界框IoU和重识别特征进行匹配。

Result: 在具有非线性运动、遮挡和拥挤场景的挑战性基准（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）上，该方法优于最先进的TBD方法，并在具有线性运动的更简单基准（如MOT17）上实现了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该MOT方法首次使用自监督编码器来细化分割掩码，而无需计算掩码IoU，并在复杂场景中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CHUG, a new large-scale subjective dataset for HDR video quality assessment (VQA) of User-Generated Content (UGC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HDR-VQA datasets mainly focus on professionally generated content (PGC), neglecting real-world UGC-HDR degradations.

Method: The authors created CHUG, a dataset of 856 UGC-HDR source videos transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates, and collected 211,848 perceptual ratings via Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Result: CHUG provides a benchmark for analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos.

Conclusion: CHUG is expected to advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse, and real-world UGC dataset.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种场景自适应策略，用于高效地分配表征能力，从不完整的观测中生成室内环境的沉浸式体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景通常呈现出具有不同复杂度的不规则布局，包含杂乱、遮挡和平坦墙壁。

Method: 利用几何先验来指导有限资源的优化利用，记录估计的几何支架上的观测统计数据，并指导基的最优放置。

Result: 在多个大型室内场景中，与采用规则放置的基线相比，展示了显著的增强。

Conclusion: 提出了一种场景自适应策略，可以有效地分配表征能力，并显著提高渲染质量。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从常规相机拍摄中获取日常环境面临频繁场景变化带来的挑战，这需要密集的时间和空间观测。

Method: 构建对象作为模板高斯，作为共享对象轨迹的结构化、可重用先验，然后通过细化流程调整先验以适应随时间变化的环境。

Result: 该框架在多个时间步长上具有通用性，并通过简单转换显著增强了 3D 环境时间演化的可扩展性。在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优于其他基线的重建质量，同时实现了快速和轻量级的更新。

Conclusion: LTGS 是一种有效的场景表示方法，可以从高度欠约束的 casual 拍摄中适应日常变化。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

*Lenny Aharon,Keemin Lee,Karan Sikka,Selmaan Chettih,Cole Hurwitz,Liam Paninski,Matthew R Whiteway*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-view pose estimation framework (MVT) for animal behavior analysis that combines novel training, post-processing, and model distillation techniques to improve accuracy, uncertainty estimates, and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view pose estimation methods for animal behavior analysis struggle with limited labeled data and poor uncertainty estimates.

Method: The proposed framework includes a multi-view transformer (MVT) with patch masking for cross-view correspondence, geometric consistency techniques (3D augmentation and triangulation loss) for calibrated setups, an extended Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) for post-processing with variance inflation, and a distillation procedure using pseudo-labels generated from improved EKS predictions.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms existing methods across three animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits.

Conclusion: The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，传统导航方法因干扰、低能见度或伪装而变得不可靠，因此需要能够在此类环境中可靠运行的无人机。高光谱成像(HSI)通过实现细粒度的材料识别和物体区分，为基于无人机的计算机视觉提供了独特的机会。

Conclusion: 该研究证实所提出的架构提高了无人机感知效率，适用于导航、物体识别和环境监测任务。

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HeadsUp的单步扩散模型，用于人像图像超分辨率重建，该模型能够无缝地恢复和放大人像图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术要么关注通用图像，要么关注严格对齐的面部图像，将不同模型混合处理人像照片会导致面部区域周围出现混合或边界伪影。

Method: 在单步扩散模型的基础上，开发了一种面部监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，并集成了一种基于参考的机制来帮助进行身份恢复。同时，构建了一个高质量的4K人像图像ISR数据集PortraitSR-4K。

Result: HeadsUp在人像ISR任务上取得了state-of-the-art的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐面部数据集上保持了相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp模型能够有效解决人像图像超分辨率重建问题，并在多个数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the limitations of current underwater image datasets, such as lack of diversity and low quality, by proposing to expand them using denoising diffusion models and enhance them using Controlnet to improve the study of the marine ecosystem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that underwater images are crucial for ocean research and marine environmental monitoring, but current datasets suffer from low diversity and quality, hindering effective image enhancement.

Method: The paper proposes expanding datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include various image types (stereo, wide-angled, macro, close-up) and enhancing images using Controlnet to improve dataset quality.

Result: The paper proposes a plan of action; therefore, specific results are not presented in the abstract. The expected result is improved datasets for underwater image analysis.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that expanding and enhancing underwater image datasets using denoising diffusion models and Controlnet can improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

*Agampreet Aulakh,Nils D. Forkert,Matthias Wilms*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new data-driven method using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model and classify brain aging trajectories from longitudinal MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods struggle with the discrete and irregular sampling patterns of longitudinal MRI data, hindering the accurate representation of continuous biological processes in brain aging.

Method: The authors propose a novel INR architecture that disentangles spatial and temporal trajectory parameters. They design a framework to operate on the INRs' parameter space for classifying brain aging trajectories. They also create a biologically grounded simulation to evaluate their method.

Result: The INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy in classifying brain aging trajectories in irregularly sampled data, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline (73.7%).

Conclusion: The proposed INR-based method effectively models and classifies brain aging trajectories from longitudinal MRI data, demonstrating improved accuracy compared to traditional deep learning approaches, especially with irregularly sampled data.

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割模型在基准测试中表现良好，但在真实世界中由于依赖虚假相关性而失效。

Method: 通过人工修正将干预信号传播到视觉相似的图像中，引导模型学习鲁棒和语义相关的特征。

Result: 在具有挑战性的cubemap数据上，分割准确率提高了9 mIoU个点（相对提高了12-15%），与标准重训练相比，标注工作量减少了3-4倍，同时在基准数据集上保持了竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架能够构建准确、对数据集偏差具有鲁棒性、数据高效且适应真实世界领域的分割系统。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

### [25] [A Multi-Strategy Framework for Enhancing Shatian Pomelo Detection in Real-World Orchards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09948)
*Pan Wang,Yihao Hu,Xiaodong Bai,Aiping Yang,Xiangxiang Li,Meiping Ding,Jianguo Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-strategy framework named REAS-Det to address the challenges of automated Shatian pomelo detection, including tone variation, inconsistent illumination, object scale variation, and occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of Shatian pomelos is needed for accurate quantity estimation and lean production, but existing methods perform poorly in real-world scenarios due to several challenges.

Method: The authors propose a multi-strategy framework, REAS-Det, which includes a multi-scenario dataset (STP-AgriData), specific data augmentations for inconsistent illumination, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules for scale variation, and a MultiSEAM structure with soft-NMS for occlusion.

Result: The proposed network achieves a precision of 87.6%, a recall of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%, demonstrating superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed REAS-Det network effectively addresses the challenges of Shatian pomelo detection and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

*Salma J. Ahmed,Emad A. Mohammed,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Joint Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual image segmentation in medical applications is time-consuming, costly, and prone to variability. AI-based methods often require large, annotated datasets and struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions.

Method: The proposed J-RAS method jointly optimizes a segmentation model with a retrieval model, enabling the segmentation model to leverage retrieved image-mask pairs and the retrieval model to learn segmentation-relevant features.

Result: J-RAS was validated on ACDC and M&Ms datasets with U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer backbones, demonstrating consistent improvements. For example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer with J-RAS improved the mean Dice score from 0.8708 to 0.9115 and the mean Hausdorff Distance from 1.8130 to 1.1489.

Conclusion: The J-RAS method is effective and generalizable across architectures and datasets for image segmentation.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

*Fan Zuo,Donglin Zhou,Jingqin Gao,Kaan Ozbay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an AI framework for large-scale traffic monitoring using existing traffic cameras, validated on NYC's congestion pricing rollout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of traditional traffic monitoring methods (sensors) and existing video analytics in terms of cost, scalability, and handling dynamic camera viewpoints.

Method: The method involves a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for real-time traffic density and classification, a graph-based viewpoint normalization method for pan-tilt-zoom cameras, and a domain-specific large language model for automated traffic pattern summaries.

Result: The results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density in the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with signs of rebound, and increased pedestrian and cyclist activity. Example-based prompts improved the LLM's accuracy.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the AI framework is a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

### [28] [FlareX: A Physics-Informed Dataset for Lens Flare Removal via 2D Synthesis and 3D Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09995)
*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Jinshan Pan,Shihao Zhou,Jinglei Shi,Duosheng Chen,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlareX, a new dataset for lens flare removal, generated using a physics-informed method combining 2D synthesis and 3D rendering to improve realism and diversity compared to existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lens flare datasets are synthetically generated in 2D, lack flare diversity, and don't adhere to physical principles, leading to poor generalization to real-world scenarios for trained models.

Method: A physics-informed method for flare data generation consisting of three stages: parameterized template creation, illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D rendering. A masking approach is used to obtain real-world flare-free images.

Result: The FlareX dataset offers 9,500 2D templates and 3,000 flare image pairs. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and dataset.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new, more realistic lens flare dataset (FlareX) and demonstrates its effectiveness for training models to remove lens flares in images, especially in real-world scenarios. The combination of 2D and 3D perspectives improves the diversity and realism of the dataset.

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

TL;DR: 本研究旨在解决短曝光图像中由滚动快门相机和交流电源照明引起的闪烁伪影问题，并提供了一个大规模、真实的闪烁消除数据集 BurstDeflicker。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁伪影会影响图像质量以及物体检测和跟踪等高级任务，但缺乏大规模、真实的数据集阻碍了闪烁消除的研究进展。

Method: 1) 开发了一种基于 Retinex 的合成管道，可以控制关键的闪烁相关属性，从而生成不同的闪烁模式。2) 从不同场景中捕获了 4,000 张真实世界的闪烁图像。3) 提出了一种绿幕方法，将运动融入图像对中，同时保留真实的闪烁退化。

Result: 综合实验表明，该数据集的有效性及其在推进闪烁消除研究方面的潜力。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker 数据集可以有效促进闪烁消除领域的研究。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

TL;DR: MIMO是一个统一的医学视觉语言模型，具有视觉参照的多模态输入和像素接地的多模态输出，可以结合视觉线索和文本指令来理解复杂的医学图像和语义，并且可以将文本输出中的医学术语在图像中定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型存在两个问题：对于输入，模型只依赖文本指令，缺乏对图像中视觉线索的直接理解；对于输出，模型只给出文本答案，缺乏与图像中关键区域的联系。

Method: 提出MIMO模型，并构建了一个包含895K样本的综合医学多模态数据集MIMOSeg。

Result: 实验结果表明，MIMO可以独特地结合视觉参照和像素接地能力，这是以前的模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型在医学多模态任务中表现出色，能够有效解决现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

*Junan Chen,Trung Thanh Nguyen,Takahiro Komamizu,Ichiro Ide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for video captioning that enhances Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by using a lightweight visual adapter module. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among PEFT methods and competitive performance compared to full fine-tuning methods while using only 1.4% of the parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the computational challenges of fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models for video captioning by exploring parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, specifically focusing on enhancing the visual information processing during fine-tuning.

Method: The method involves introducing Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module with learnable query tokens and a gating layer into the Vision Encoder to extract sparse, caption-relevant features without external textual supervision.

Result: Q-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance among PEFT methods on MSR-VTT and MSVD datasets, and competitive performance compared to full fine-tuning methods while using only 1.4% of the parameters. The paper also analyzes the impact of key hyperparameters and design choices.

Conclusion: Q-Adapter demonstrates strong potential in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, showing its scalability for video-language modeling. The results provide insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

TL;DR: P-4DGS: A novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene modeling, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, fast rendering, and low storage footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic 3DGS algorithms have high memory consumption due to neglecting temporal and spatial redundancies.

Method: Propose a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module and an adaptive quantization strategy with context-based entropy coding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, fast rendering speed, and a remarkably low storage footprint (around 1MB on average), achieving up to 40x and 90x compression on synthetic and real-world scenes, respectively.

Conclusion: P-4DGS effectively reduces memory consumption while maintaining high reconstruction quality and rendering speed for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为互补和对比 Transformer (CCFormer) 的新框架，用于音频-视觉分割 (AVS)，该框架能够处理局部和全局信息并全面捕获时空上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的 CNN 方法通过填充和乘法等基本操作来管理音频-视觉交互，但受到 CNN 有限的局部感受野的限制。最近，基于 Transformer 的方法将听觉线索视为查询，利用注意力机制来增强帧内的音频-视觉协作。然而，它们通常难以充分提取多模态系数和时间动态。

Method: CCFormer 以早期集成模块 (EIM) 开始，该模块采用并行双边架构，将多尺度视觉特征与音频数据合并，以增强跨模态互补性。为了提取帧内空间特征并促进对时间连贯性的感知，我们引入了多查询 Transformer 模块 (MTM)，该模块动态地赋予音频查询学习能力，并同时对帧和视频级别的关系进行建模。此外，我们提出了双模态对比学习 (BCL) 以促进统一特征空间中两种模态之间的对齐。

Result: 我们的方法在 S4、MS3 和 AVSS 数据集上设置了新的最先进的基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer 通过有效结合 EIM、MTM 和 BCL，在音频-视觉分割任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

TL;DR: ViTAR: A new VLM framework mimicking human expert's iterative reasoning for improved medical image diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs lack human-like iterative visual cue analysis, hindering accurate diagnosis.

Method: Introduces a 'think-act-rethink-answer' cognitive chain, interactive medical images, and a two-stage training strategy (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning). Also includes curated instruction and VQA datasets.

Result: ViTAR outperforms existing models and focuses attention on clinically relevant areas.

Conclusion: Embedding iterative thinking chains improves both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Motivation: The motivation is to address the lack of study on the subjective perception and realism assessment of deepfakes, which is crucial for evaluating their quality, deceptiveness, and potential impact.

Method: The paper presents a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which includes a deepfake video dataset, a large-scale annotation with realism scores and textual descriptions from human annotators, and a comprehensive evaluation of 16 realism assessment methods, including a newly proposed description-aligned CLIP method.

Result: The paper provides a benchmark and insights that can lay the foundation for future research in deepfake realism assessment and related areas.

Conclusion: The paper successfully introduces the DREAM benchmark for deepfake realism assessment, providing a foundation for future research and highlighting the importance of subjective perception in evaluating deepfakes.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and

Motivation: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning task. This task is confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery.

Method: The method includes three modules: a semantic-related feature learning module, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module, and a collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature learning and label recovery.

Result: CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE).

Conclusion: The proposed CLSL method effectively addresses the challenges of semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery in multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE), a novel model unifying neural graphs with masked autoencoders. It uses random modality masking, combines pre-training and fine-tuning, and enables inference-time ensembles. They also apply knowledge distillation and release a data-pipeline software and an extended Dronescapes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve computer vision tasks by leveraging self-supervised pre-training methods, specifically Masked Autoencoders (MAE), without requiring manually labeled data.

Method: The paper introduces PHG-MAE, which unifies neural graphs with masked autoencoders. It uses random masking of modalities, combines pre-training and fine-tuning into a single loop, and creates inference-time ensembles. Knowledge distillation is applied to these ensembles.

Result: The approach boosts final prediction performance and consistency through ensemble aggregation. Knowledge distillation can be applied with little loss in performance, even with small models. The method is demonstrated on outdoor UAV scenes and the extended Dronescapes dataset.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel model (PHG-MAE) and a data-pipeline software, demonstrating their effectiveness in multi-modal multi-task learning scenarios. The resources, including code and the extended dataset, are publicly released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

Motivation: 现有研究主要集中在单阶段或灾前灾后双阶段滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演变。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，使用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互式细化范式下，实现滑坡疤痕的连续准确识别。

Conclusion: 该框架能够连续追踪滑坡疤痕，捕捉对早期预警至关重要的失败先兆，以及对评估次生灾害和长期稳定性至关重要的失败后演变。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction from unposed sparse images, overcoming the limitations of NeRF and 3DGS in such settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF and 3DGS are limited by their dependence on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage, hindering their use in sparse-view settings where pose estimation is unreliable.

Method: Gesplat uses a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization, a graph-guided attribute refinement module, and flow-based depth regularization. It leverages the VGGT foundation model for initial poses and dense point clouds.

Result: The approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Conclusion: Gesplat enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images by addressing the challenges of pose estimation and supervision in sparse-view settings.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FedCoPL, a novel method for unsupervised federated learning (UFL) in classification problems using CLIP. It addresses challenges in UFL by using pseudo-labeling and a partial prompt aggregation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending UFL to classification problems with CLIP, which was previously infeasible, presents new opportunities.

Method: The proposed FedCoPL method includes:1) clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. 2) a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization: visual prompts are aggregated at the server, while text prompts are retained locally.

Result: Experiments demonstrate FedCoPL's superior performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The paper successfully extends UFL to classification with CLIP by introducing FedCoPL, which uses pseudo-labeling and partial prompt aggregation to improve performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

### [41] [Answer-Consistent Chain-of-thought Reinforcement Learning For Multi-modal Large Langauge Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10104)
*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) to improve the consistency between reasoning and answers in multimodal LLMs, particularly in visual question-answering tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning can improve answer accuracy but may lead to inconsistencies between the reasoning process and the final answer. Standard methods like GRPO show frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning in visual question-answering tasks.

Method: The authors propose ACRE, which modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. It involves shuffling answer options and prompting the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. A consistency-verification reward is designed to penalize reasoning-answer misalignment.

Result: ACRE achieves an average 2.2% and 1.5% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: ACRE improves the consistency between reasoning and answers in multimodal LLMs, reducing reliance on spurious patterns.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

### [42] [Uncertainty-Aware Post-Detection Framework for Enhanced Fire and Smoke Detection in Compact Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10108)
*Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,Godwyn James William,Shreyas Srinivas Joshi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-aware post-detection framework to improve the accuracy of compact deep learning models for fire and smoke detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-based methods using compact models like YOLOv5n/v8n struggle with balancing efficiency and reliability, leading to false positives and missed detections. Traditional post-detection methods are also limited.

Method: Introduces a Confidence Refinement Network that integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to rescale detection confidences.

Result: Demonstrates improved precision, recall, and mean average precision on the D-Fire dataset compared to baselines, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Post-detection rescoring effectively enhances the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection.

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC) 的无需训练的框架，用于图像篡改定位 (IML) 任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督或无训练替代方案通常表现不佳且缺乏可解释性，而有监督的 IML 依赖于昂贵的像素级注释。

Method: ICFC 集成了对象化的规则构建与自适应过滤，以构建可靠的知识库，并采用多步骤渐进推理流程，模拟专家取证工作流程，从粗略的提议到细粒度的取证结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC 不仅超越了最先进的无训练方法，而且实现了与弱监督和完全监督方法相比具有竞争力或更优越的性能。

Conclusion: ICFC 能够系统地利用 MLLM 推理进行图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性，从而实现高效且可解释的图像篡改定位。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 介绍ImmerIris数据集，一个大规模的VR头显采集的虹膜图像数据集，并提出了一种新的无需归一化的虹膜识别方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在增强现实和虚拟现实等以自我为中心的应用程序中，沉浸式虹膜识别正在成为一种准确且无缝的身份识别方式。现有的虹膜识别系统在沉浸式设置中表现不佳，并且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 构建了一个大规模数据集ImmerIris，并提出了一种新的无需归一化的虹膜识别范式，该范式直接从眼部图像中学习，只需进行最小的调整。

Result: 提出的无需归一化方法优于基于归一化的方法。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，无需归一化的虹膜识别方法在鲁棒的沉浸式识别方面具有 promising 的方向。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于手势的PD识别系统准确率不令人满意，因此需要更有效的PD严重程度评估方法。

Method: 从手指敲击视频中提取时间、频率和幅度特征，并使用集成了CNN、BiLSTM和注意力机制的混合深度学习框架进行多类PD严重程度分类。

Result: 该模型在区分五个严重程度等级方面表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: 集成空间时间表示和注意力机制可以改善自动PD严重程度检测，使其成为支持临床医生进行PD监测和进展跟踪的有前途的非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

*Halil Hüseyin Çalışkan,Talha Koruk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet is introduced for low-light image enhancement and super-resolution, achieving high SSIM/PSNR with fewer parameters compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for low-light image enhancement and super-resolution have limitations in terms of SSIM/PSNR scores, computational power, and parameter size.

Method: A novel DeepFusionNet architecture is proposed for both low-light image enhancement and super-resolution tasks. An autoencoder-based super-resolution model using DeepFusionNet is also developed.

Result: DeepFusionNet achieves 92.8% SSIM and 26.30 PSNR on the LOL-v1 dataset with 2.5 million parameters for low-light enhancement. The DeepFusionNet-based super-resolution method achieves 25.30 PSNR and 80.7% SSIM on the validation set with approximately 100 thousand parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed DeepFusionNet architecture offers a promising solution for both low-light image enhancement and super-resolution, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Result: 模型大小为6.35MB，比YOLOv11小32.5%，mAP提高2.5%达到90.1%，F1-Score提高1.4%达到85.5%，帧率为57.2FPS。

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi适用于复杂果园环境下的无人机荔枝检测，具有在精准农业中广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D: A framework for colorizing static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs with user-guided control, preserving color diversity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods sacrifice chromatic richness and controllability by averaging color variations for multi-view consistency in static scenarios. Color3D aims to address these limitations.

Method: Color3D colorizes a single key view and fine-tunes a personalized colorizer to propagate color to novel views and time steps, ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. It uses a Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation for colorful 3D scene reconstruction.

Result: Experiments show Color3D delivers more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks.

Conclusion: Color3D cleverly transforms complex 3D colorization into a single-image paradigm, allowing integration of various image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability.

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单个框架内统一角色一致性生成和编辑任务，生成方法难以保证细粒度的身份一致性，编辑方法损失空间可控性和指令对齐。

Method: 1. ReMix 模块：利用 MLLM 编辑语义特征，调整指令嵌入以适应 DiT backbone。2. IP-ControlNet：扩展 ControlNet，解耦语义和布局线索，引入 ε-equivariant 潜在空间，在共享噪声空间中联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Result: ReMix 支持个性化生成、图像编辑、风格迁移和多条件合成等多种任务，实验验证了其有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ReMix 作为一个统一框架，能够有效地进行角色一致性图像生成和编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

*Zhenjie Mao,Yuhuan Yang,Chaofan Ma,Dongsheng Jiang,Jiangchao Yao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces SaFiRe, a novel framework that mimics the human cognitive process to address the limitations of current Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) models in handling ambiguous expressions. It also introduces a new benchmark, aRefCOCO, to evaluate RIS models under such expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RIS methods struggle with complex expressions containing object-distracting or category-implicit cues, often reducing the problem to simple keyword matching.

Method: The proposed SaFiRe framework uses Mamba's scan-then-update property to mimic a two-phase cognitive process: forming a global understanding and then refining it through detail-oriented inspection. This allows for efficient multi-cycle refinement.

Result: Experiments on standard and the new aRefCOCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The SaFiRe framework effectively addresses challenges posed by ambiguous referring expressions in RIS, showcasing improved performance on both existing and newly introduced benchmarks.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated segmentation labels hinders the supervision of models in underwater image analysis.

Method: SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to guide annotators and propagates sparse labels with a hybrid approach leveraging SAM and superpixel-based methods.

Result: Experiments on two diverse underwater datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to +5% mIoU over D+NN.

Conclusion: The paper's main contribution is the design and release of an interactive annotation tool that enables ecology researchers to efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med: A transformer-based framework for visual concept explainability in medical imaging, predicting and localizing concepts with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept-based models lack visual explanations, limiting their utility, especially in medical contexts.

Method: Introduces multi-concept learnable tokens and specialized attention layers to predict and localize visual concepts.

Result: Outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models on medical datasets.

Conclusion: ViConEx-Med shows promise for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts.

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual

### [54] [HccePose(BF): Predicting Front \& Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10177)
*Yulin Wang,Mengting Hu,Hongli Li,Chen Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to pose estimation for seen objects by predicting 3D coordinates of both front and back surfaces and densely sampling 3D coordinates between them, creating ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation methods for seen objects focus on improving the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front surface, neglecting the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior of the object.

Method: The study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them to create ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences. It also proposes Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) for a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface coordinates.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website across seven classic BOP core datasets.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that utilizing the full surface and interior of the object by predicting 3D coordinates of both front and back surfaces and densely sampling 3D coordinates enhances pose estimation accuracy.

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

*Zixu Zhao,Yang Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new drone video-text dataset (DVTMD) and a novel Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework for drone video retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient retrieval of relevant content from UAV videos is crucial for various applications, but existing datasets have limitations in providing fine-grained captions.

Method: The authors construct the DVTMD dataset and propose the TCMA framework, which integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, word-guided patch alignment, and a Word and Patch Selection module.

Result: The TCMA framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVTMD and CapERA datasets, with 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval.

Conclusion: The proposed DVTMD dataset and TCMA framework are effective for drone text-video retrieval, establishing a new benchmark in this domain.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

*Haohua Dong,Ana Manzano Rodríguez,Camille Guinaudeau,Shin'ichi Satoh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了伪平衡方法，用于减轻半监督学习中人脸性别分类模型的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型通常会反映和放大训练数据中存在的人口统计偏差，导致不同性别和种族亚组的表现不均。

Method: 在伪标签选择过程中，强制执行人口统计平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的未标记图像，而无需访问真实注释。

Result: 在 FairFace 数据集上微调有偏差的性别分类器，并在故意不平衡的训练数据上进行压力测试，结果表明，伪平衡始终提高公平性，同时保持或提高准确性。总体准确率达到 79.81%，比基线提高 6.53%，性别准确率差距缩小 44.17%。在基线差异超过 49% 的东亚亚组中，差距缩小至 5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度倾斜的未标记数据集也可以作为现有计算机视觉模型去偏见的强大资源。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding using natural language. It extends relational learning from binary to n-ary to identify visual relations and uses a grouped supervision loss to facilitate n-ary relational learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding.

Method: A novel progressive relational learning framework is proposed.  A grouped supervision loss is designed to facilitate n-ary relational learning. A multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms is used to localize the target within the n-ary combinations.

Result: The method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks.

Conclusion: The advantages of n-ary relational perception in 3D localization are proven.

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CerS-Path, a cervical subspecialty pathology diagnostic system, which enhances diagnostic accuracy and generalizability through a two-stage pretraining process and integration with multiple downstream diagnostic functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for cervical cancer diagnosis lack accuracy and generalizability, while general foundation models struggle to capture subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability.

Method: The CerS-Path system was developed through self-supervised learning on approximately 190 million tissue patches and multimodal enhancement with 2.5 million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream diagnostic functions.

Result: CerS-Path supports eight diagnostic functions, demonstrates a significant advance in cervical pathology, and maintains 99.38% screening sensitivity in prospective testing on 3,173 cases across five centers.

Conclusion: CerS-Path shows potential for subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening by addressing the limitations of existing models and achieving excellent generalizability.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

*Dingyi Yao,Xinyao Han,Ruibo Ming,Zhihang Song,Lihui Peng,Jianming Hu,Danya Yao,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a framework and a new metric (SEDD) to quantify the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving datasets, aiming to improve the generalization of AI models trained on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets hinders the generalization of AI models for autonomous driving. Quantifying this gap is crucial for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of better training pipelines.

Method: The paper proposes a framework that uses Gram matrix-based style extraction and metric learning (optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation) to extract style embeddings. The SEDD metric is then used to quantify the synthetic-to-real gap based on these embeddings.

Result: Experiments on various datasets and sim-to-real methods demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively quantify the synthetic-to-real gap.

Conclusion: The paper provides a standardized tool for quality control, enabling systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, which will advance the development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

*Chuangchuang Tan,Xiang Ming,Jinglu Wang,Renshuai Tao,Bin Li,Yunchao Wei,Yao Zhao,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnomReason, a large-scale benchmark for detecting semantic anomalies in AI-generated images. It also presents AnomAgent, a modular multi-agent pipeline for generating structured annotations. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of AnomReason in improving the semantic plausibility of AIGC images and its utility in explainable deepfake detection and semantic reasonableness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the issue of semantic anomalies in AI-generated content (AIGC) which can compromise the trustworthiness of these images. Detecting these anomalies is crucial for AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection, and semantic authenticity assessment.

Method: The method involves formalizing semantic anomaly detection and reasoning for AIGC images and introducing AnomReason, a large-scale benchmark with structured annotations. A modular multi-agent pipeline (AnomAgent) with human-in-the-loop verification is used to produce annotations. Models are then fine-tuned on AnomReason and evaluated using a semantic matching metric.

Result: The results show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over strong vision-language baselines. Applications to explainable deepfake detection and semantic reasonableness assessment of image generators demonstrate practical utility.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that AnomReason and AnomAgent serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility of AI-generated images. The authors also promise to release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned models to support further research.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

*Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Ming Li,Yuheng Li,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large vision model (LVM) is evaluated in a zero-shot setting across four representative medical imaging tasks: organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on medical data, inspired by the strong zero-shot generalization of large generative models.

Method: A large vision model (LVM) is used in a zero-shot setting without domain-specific fine-tuning. The model is evaluated on 4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes.

Result: The LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution. In radiotherapy motion prediction, the model forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy and surpassing specialized DVF-based and generative baselines.

Conclusion: The findings reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified learners and reasoners, laying the groundwork for future medical foundation models built on video models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in few-shot scenarios by revising the core optimization and using a novel densification trigger based on opacity gradient and a more conservative pruning schedule.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS suffers from overfitting and bloated reconstructions in few-shot scenarios, and existing methods increase the primitive count.

Method: The paper replaces the positional gradient heuristic with an opacity gradient-based densification trigger and pairs it with a conservative pruning schedule, along with a depth-correlation loss.

Result: The proposed framework achieves significant compactness improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods on the 3-view LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets, with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics.

Conclusion: The paper establishes a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis by improving the efficiency of 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿势驱动的人体动画方法通常受限于头部动作僵硬和手部模糊，主要是由于音频与头部动作之间的弱相关性以及手部的结构复杂性。

Method: 该论文提出了VividAnimator框架，包括预训练的手部清晰度代码本（HCC），双流音频感知模块（DSAA）和姿势校准技巧（PCT）。

Result: 实验表明，VividAnimator实现了最先进的性能，生成具有卓越手部细节，手势真实感和身份一致性的视频，并通过定量指标和定性评估进行了验证。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过创新性的模块设计和训练技巧，显著提升了音频和姿势驱动的人体动画的质量，尤其在手部细节和动作自然度方面。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Motivation: 当前最先进的方法通常只依赖于透视视图（PV）或鸟瞰视图（BEV）特征，限制了它们利用细粒度对象细节和空间结构化场景表示的能力。

Method: 引入了由基础模型引导的BEV地图，利用描述性的DINOv2特征，通过一种新颖的蒸馏过程将其提炼成BEV表示。通过将PV特征与富含DINOv2的语义和几何特征的BEV地图相结合，该模型通过可变形聚合来利用这种混合表示，以增强3D对象检测和跟踪。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2基准上进行了大量实验，证明DualViewDistill达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明了基础模型BEV地图在实现更可靠的自动驾驶感知方面的潜力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained

Motivation: Fine-tuning SAM2 for fundus image segmentation is challenging.

Method: Integrates a low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder of SAM2, using <5% of original trainable parameters. Uses a composite loss function (segmentationBCE, SoftDice, FocalTversky).

Result: Demonstrates high performance in blood vessel (Dice up to 0.86, AUC up to 0.98) and optic disc segmentation (Dice up to 0.93, AUC up to 0.99) on 11 fundus datasets.

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced training overhead for cross-dataset fundus segmentation.

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art

reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7
percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of
0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

### [68] [Ortho-Fuse: Orthomosaic Generation for Sparse High-Resolution Crop Health Maps Through Intermediate Optical Flow Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10360)
*Rugved Katole,Christopher Stewart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that reduces the overlap requirements for generating reliable orthomosaics from aerial imagery, which can help promote the adoption of AI-driven crop health mapping systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widespread farmer adoption of AI-driven crop health mapping systems is limited by technical issues in generating orthomosaics from sparse aerial imagery data, specifically the high overlap requirements for traditional photogrammetric reconstruction.

Method: The paper presents Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that uses intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates a 20% reduction in minimum overlap requirements using Ortho-Fuse.

Conclusion: The paper analyzes adoption barriers in precision agriculture and identifies pathways for enhanced integration of AI-driven monitoring systems, suggesting that reducing overlap requirements can improve user confidence and promote adoption.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

*Linlian Jiang,Rui Ma,Li Gu,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PointMAC的元学习框架，用于点云补全中的鲁棒测试时自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云补全模型执行静态推理，并且过度依赖训练期间学习的归纳偏置，限制了它们在测试时适应新结构模式和传感器引起的失真的能力。

Method: 该方法优化了completion模型，使其在模拟结构和传感器级别不完整性的两个自监督辅助目标下工作。基于模型无关元学习 (MAML) 的元辅助学习策略确保由辅助目标驱动的适应与主要completion任务一致对齐。在推理过程中，我们通过优化辅助损失来实时调整共享编码器，同时保持解码器固定。为了进一步稳定适应性，我们引入了自适应λ校准，这是一种用于平衡主要和辅助目标之间梯度的元学习机制。

Result: 在合成、模拟和真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，PointMAC通过单独优化每个样本以产生高质量的补全，从而实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 据我们所知，这是第一个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

TL;DR: 本研究探索了使用视觉基础模型（VFM）处理光电容积脉搏波（PPG）信号的新方法，通过将一维PPG信号转换为二维图像表示，例如短时傅里叶变换（STFT），并利用最新的VFM（如DINOv3和SIGLIP-2），在血压估计等任务上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pavement crack detection relies on expensive and time-consuming pixel-level annotations, hindering large-scale infrastructure monitoring.

Method: The Crack-Segmenter framework integrates a Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE), a Directional Attention Transformer (DAT), and an Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module.

Result: Crack-Segmenter outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods on ten public datasets across major metrics (mIoU, Dice score, XOR, HD).

Conclusion: Annotation-free crack detection is feasible and superior, enabling scalable and cost-effective monitoring. The work advances self-supervised learning in pavement crack detection.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

### [72] [Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383)
*Sai Teja Erukude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the issue of hidden biases in CNNs for machine vision, where the decision-making process can be influenced by background information. The authors propose techniques to identify these biases, distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that CNNs, while effective, operate as a "black box," making it difficult to understand which features are most influential and leading to potential biases in decision-making due to background information.

Method: The authors propose two methods: (1) dividing images into smaller, randomly shuffled tiles, and (2) applying image transforms (Fourier, Wavelet, Median filter) to recover background noise information. These methods are tested on six datasets.

Result: The results indicate that the proposed methods can effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise and alert on the presence of background noise.

Conclusion: The study concludes that the proposed methods can help identify and mitigate hidden biases in CNNs by distinguishing between contextual information and background noise, even without explicit background information.

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions
with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting
both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a
powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration
between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training
pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated
dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2)
AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance
temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and
reducing collapse. Experimental results demonstrate that AVoCaDO significantly
outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video
captioning benchmarks, and also achieves competitive performance on the VDC and
DREAM-1K benchmark under visual-only settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mesh-Gait: A novel gait recognition framework using 3D heatmaps reconstructed from 2D silhouettes, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with improved robustness and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gait recognition methods struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the computational cost of 3D data. Multi-modal approaches offer robustness but are computationally expensive.

Method: Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps from 2D silhouettes as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to capture 3D geometric information efficiently. It uses supervised learning with losses calculated between reconstructed 3D joints, markers, meshes, and their ground truth.

Result: Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in gait recognition.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait effectively combines the strengths of 2D and 3D modalities for robust and efficient gait recognition.

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

### [75] [Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10414)
*Chin-Hung Teng,Ben-Jian Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to improve image feature matching efficiency by integrating feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework, complementing epipolar geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Matching feature points in images is time-consuming, especially with many features. Feature spatial order can improve matching efficiency.

Method: Integrate feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework, using initial matches to model spatial order and filter unnecessary matches. Combine with epipolar geometry and use image alignment to remove rotation effects.

Result: Experiments show the proposed method is more efficient and accurate than traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves image feature matching efficiency and accuracy by leveraging feature spatial order and epipolar geometry.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中表现不佳，容易产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参照物。

Method: 提出Human-Like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG)框架，包括开放词汇检测（what）、SAM 衍生的掩码空间解析（where）和局部与全局对齐之间的权衡（reweight）三个阶段。还使用了掩码引导的微调，将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 大量实验表明，HuLiRAG 框架提高了 grounding 的保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG 框架通过模拟人类的推理过程，改进了多模态问答，使其更值得信赖。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CoDeGraph, a novel algorithm for zero-shot image anomaly classification and segmentation that filters consistent anomalies by identifying 'neighbor-burnout' in similarity computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with consistent anomalies, leading to poor performance in anomaly classification and segmentation.

Method: CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph and uses community detection to filter consistent anomalies, leveraging Extreme Value Theory for theoretical support.

Result: CoDeGraph achieves state-of-the-art results on MVTec AD, with significant improvements in both anomaly classification (98.3% AUROC) and segmentation (up to 69.1% F1 and 71.9% AP).

Conclusion: CoDeGraph effectively addresses the challenge of consistent anomalies in zero-shot anomaly detection, demonstrating robustness across different architectures.

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of inter-rater variability (IRV) in medical image segmentation annotation, where standard averaging methods discard valuable clinical uncertainty.

Method: An Expert Signature Generator (ESG) learns individual annotator styles in a latent space, and a Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art results on CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores).

Conclusion: Treating expert disagreement as a useful signal leads to more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiTIPS, a new public dataset for TIPS prognosis, and proposes a multimodal framework for predicting survival outcomes, portal pressure gradient (PPG), and overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning models for TIPS prognosis suffer from labor-intensive ROI annotation, poor reliability and generalizability of unimodal methods, and incomplete assessment from single-endpoint prediction.  The lack of public datasets also hinders research.

Method: The proposed framework includes dual-option segmentation (semi-supervised and foundation model-based), multimodal interaction (MGRA, POD, CGPE), and multi-task prediction with a staged training strategy.

Result: Experiments on MultiTIPS show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches with strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows promise for clinical application in TIPS prognosis. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

*Jinjin Cao,Zhiyang Chen,Zijun Wang,Liyuan Ma,Weijian Luo,Guojun Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Cross-Modal Guidance (CMG), a training-free decoding method to mitigate hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs suffer from hallucinations, generating fluent but irrelevant responses due to language bias.

Method: CMG leverages the difference between the output distributions of the original model and a degraded version with masked visual-language attention, adaptively masking the attention weight of the most influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception.

Result: CMG demonstrates superior advantages without additional conditions or training costs, improving performance on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalizing effectively.

Conclusion: CMG effectively reduces language bias in VLMs without harming their abilities, leading to improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Motivation: Existing pseudo-image-based methods for LiDAR point cloud processing often overlook structural and semantic details, limiting feature fusion and discriminability.

Method: DAGLFNet uses a Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding module, a Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network, and a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism.

Result: DAGLFNet achieves 69.83% and 78.65% on the validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively.

Conclusion: DAGLFNet balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

### [82] [Towards Self-Refinement of Vision-Language Models with Triangular Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10487)
*Yunlong Deng,Guangyi Chen,Tianpei Gu,Lingjing Kong,Yan Li,Zeyu Tang,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the self-refinement capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without supervised instruction. It proposes a Triangular Consistency principle-based self-refinement framework to generate high-quality supervised data autonomously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore the potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction, specifically their inherent self-refinement capabilities.

Method: The method involves a self-refinement framework based on a Triangular Consistency principle, which includes instruction generation, image-query-answer triplet generation and filtering, and model updating using filtered synthetic data. A theoretical analysis from a causal perspective is also conducted.

Result: Experiments show that the model can autonomously achieve consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks without external supervision.

Conclusion: The study validates the self-refinement capabilities of VLMs and suggests that the insights can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

*Jiaye Li,Baoyou Chen,Hui Li,Zilong Dong,Jingdong Wang,Siyu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces HARoPE, an improvement to RoPE for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE has limitations in image generation, specifically in fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting.

Method: The paper proposes HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that uses a learnable linear transformation before the rotary mapping to enable dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields.

Result: HARoPE improves performance over RoPE baselines in class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: HARoPE serves as an effective drop-in replacement for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

*Yuteng Ye,Zheng Zhang,Qinchuan Zhang,Di Wang,Youjia Zhang,Wenxiao Zhang,Wei Yang,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D is a multi-view diffusion pipeline for controllable 3D style transfer that decouples style from content, enabling fast and view-consistent stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods rely on heavy per-scene optimization and often entangle style with semantic content.

Method: Leverages jigsaw operation (spatial shuffling and random masking of reference patches) to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic statistics, integrates style cues into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention, and style-bakes the renders onto the surface.

Result: Achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency with lower latency, generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation.

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D is an effective approach for controllable 3D style transfer.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker) 的框架，通过赋予奖励模型视觉推理能力和可配置的视觉记忆窗口，来解决现有模型在处理视觉生成模型时，由于视觉输入占用大量上下文预算而导致的细节丢失，以及信息过度集中于初始提示而引起的幻觉和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态奖励模型存在两个主要限制：视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致细节丢失；所有视觉信息都集中在初始提示中，加剧了推理过程中的幻觉和遗忘。

Method: 引入VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker)，它赋予奖励模型视觉推理操作（如选择帧）和可配置的视觉记忆窗口。通过强化微调流程激活视觉推理，包括冷启动、选择性样本微调和Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中，VR-Thinker 在开源模型中取得了最先进的准确率，尤其是在较长的视频上。例如，一个7B VR-Thinker 在VideoGen Reward上达到了80.5%，在GenAI-Bench上达到了82.3%，在MJ-Bench-Video上达到了75.6%。

Conclusion: 实验结果验证了基于图像进行思考的多模态奖励建模的有效性和前景。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN inference by expanding the CNN receptive field with a fixed table size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LUT methods for CNN inference suffer from limited receptive field due to the combinatorial explosion of table size.

Method: The paper proposes learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer to adaptively allocate quantization resolution across data dimensions. It also introduces irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure.

Result: The proposed approach effectively balances speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Conclusion: The innovations in this paper allow for significant improvements over existing LUT methods by effectively balancing speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal

*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the challenge of handling missing modalities in multi-modal learning, especially with imbalanced missing rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The imbalance in missing modalities leads to inconsistent learning and degraded feature quality, which existing methods often overlook by focusing on global balancing.

Method: The paper proposes Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE), which includes Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE) for dynamically balancing modality-specific learning and Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE) for improving feature semantics and robustness.

Result: MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four multi-modal benchmarks under various missing configurations.

Conclusion: MCE effectively tackles the limitations of existing methods in handling missing modalities with imbalanced missing rates by dynamically balancing learning progress and enhancing feature quality.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Motivation: Predictive research on GLOFs is hindered by fragmented and unimodal data.

Method: Integration of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products, and MODIS Land Surface Temperature records, with preprocessing including cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding.

Result: Seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions.

Conclusion: GLOFNet is publicly available to support future research in glacial hazard prediction, addressing challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution for benchmarking multimodal deep learning approaches.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Motivation: Producing temporally coherent videos with fine-grained motion control in audio-driven talking-head generation is challenging.

Method: A motion auto-encoder builds a structured latent space for independent motion factors. Optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor generates temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio.

Result: DEMO outperforms prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity.

Conclusion: Combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling provides a powerful paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing costs and yield losses caused by weeds by enabling automated targeting systems in precision agriculture. The challenge lies in the similarities between weeds and crops, variations in field conditions, and the need for large labeled datasets which are costly to create.

Method: A deep semi-supervised approach combining consistency regularization with similarity learning, using a deep auto-encoder architecture.

Result: Experiments on the DeepWeeds dataset and in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning models.

Conclusion: The proposed joint learning strategy improves the utilization of unlabeled data and provides robust, high classification performance in weed species classification, especially when labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis

Conclusion: FS-VFM 可以作为下游人脸安全任务的通用视觉基础模型。

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

TL;DR: This paper introduces UniFlow, a unified tokenizer that balances visual understanding and generation by using layer-wise adaptive self-distillation and a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers struggle with a performance trade-off between high-level semantic abstraction for understanding and low-level pixel reconstruction for generation.

Method: UniFlow uses layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to pre-trained visual encoders and a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder to achieve high-fidelity pixel reconstruction.

Result: UniFlow achieves state-of-the-art results on 13 benchmarks across 7 visual understanding and generation tasks, outperforming existing methods like TokenFlow-XL and UniTok.

Conclusion: UniFlow effectively addresses the conflict between understanding and generation in visual tokenizers, leading to a win-win outcome in performance.

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,

### [95] [Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577)
*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Diff-ABFlow, a novel optical flow estimation framework based on diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion, to address the challenges of motion blur and insufficient illumination in high-speed and low-light scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optical flow estimation in high-speed and low-light scenes suffers from motion blur and insufficient illumination, leading to weakened texture, amplified noise, and deteriorated appearance saturation and boundary completeness, which affects motion feature matching.

Method: The paper proposes a diffusion model-based framework (Diff-ABFlow) that learns the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, combined with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Result: The abstract does not explicitly state the quantitative results of the proposed method. It focuses on the challenges and the proposed solution.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a novel optical flow estimation framework, Diff-ABFlow, designed to overcome the limitations of conventional methods in challenging high-speed and low-light conditions by leveraging diffusion models and frame-event data fusion.

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

*Sneha Varur,Anirudh R Hanchinamani,Tarun S Bagewadi,Uma Mudenagudi,Chaitra D Desai,Sujata C,Padmashree Desai,Sumit Meharwade*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的框架，即解耦风格-内容 GAN (DISC-GAN)，它将风格-内容解耦与特定于集群的训练策略相结合，以实现逼真的水下图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成水下图像的质量受到颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象的挑战。这些现象由不同水体中不同的风格变化来表示，例如色调和雾霾的变化。生成模型非常适合捕获复杂的模式，但它们通常缺乏对不同水下环境的非均匀条件进行建模的能力。

Method: 采用 K-means 聚类将数据集划分为特定于风格的域。我们使用单独的编码器来获取风格和内容的潜在空间；我们进一步通过自适应实例规范化 (AdaIN) 集成这些潜在表示，并解码结果以生成最终的合成图像。该模型在每个风格集群上独立训练，以保留特定领域的特征。

Result: 该框架展示了最先进的性能，获得了 0.9012 的结构相似性指数 (SSIM)、32.5118 dB 的平均峰值信噪比 (PSNR) 和 13.3728 的 Frechet Inception 距离 (FID)。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN 框架能够有效地合成逼真的水下图像，并在多个指标上取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

*Shizhen Zhao,Jiahui Liu,Xin Wen,Haoru Tan,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of pre-trained vision foundation models for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that the impact of pre-trained vision foundation models on OOD detection is underexplored, despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable features.

Method: The method involves investigating representative vision foundation models, proposing a Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, and introducing a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup strategy.

Result: The results show that a pre-trained DINOv2 model provides a highly discriminative feature space for OOD detection, and the proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline methods.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that fine-tuning foundation models and using the proposed MoFE module and Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup strategy can enhance OOD detection, but performance remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space, which is addressed by the proposed solutions.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

TL;DR: MSCloudCAM: A novel cloud segmentation network using cross-attention and multi-scale context for accurate classification of clouds and shadows in multispectral satellite imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clouds hinder reliable analysis in optical satellite imagery for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research.

Method: A Cross-Attention with Multi-Scale Context Network (MSCloudCAM) is proposed, which combines a Swin Transformer backbone, multi-scale context modules (ASPP and PSP), a Cross-Attention block, and attention modules (ECAB and Spatial Attention Module).

Result: MSCloudCAM achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome datasets, outperforming leading baseline architectures.

Conclusion: MSCloudCAM is effective and practical for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf: A unified post-training paradigm integrating SFT and RLVR for Large Vision-and-Language Models, addressing the limitations of each method and outperforming them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT in LVLMs often leads to sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks exceeding the model's internal knowledge. ViSurf aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: Integrates SFT and RLVR in a single stage, injecting ground-truth labels into RLVR rollouts, and introduces three reward control strategies.

Result: ViSurf outperforms SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT -> RLVR across several benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViSurf effectively combines external supervision and internal reinforcement, validated by extensive experiments and in-depth analysis.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

*Junwon You,Dasol Kang,Jae-Hun Jung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为 ToMCLIP 的拓扑对齐框架，用于解决多语言 CLIP 模型中的跨模态对齐偏差问题。该框架通过拓扑保持约束对齐嵌入空间，利用持久同调定义拓扑对齐损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在跨模态对齐方面存在偏向英语的问题，多语言扩展虽然有所缓解，但忽略了共享嵌入空间的全局几何结构。

Method: 该方法应用持久同调来定义拓扑对齐损失，并使用图稀疏化策略以理论误差界限逼近持久化图。

Result: 该方法增强了多语言表示的结构一致性，提高了 CIFAR-100 上的零样本准确率，并在 xFlickr&CO 上实现了更强大的多语言检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为将拓扑对齐纳入表示学习提供了一种通用方法，不仅限于 VLMs。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

TL;DR: OmniQuality-R: A unified reward modeling framework for multi-task visual quality evaluation, transforming reasoning into continuous reward signals for policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual evaluation approaches are limited to single tasks. This paper aims to create a unified framework for multi-task quality reasoning.

Method: 1. Construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset via rejection sampling to form a chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset.
2. Apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a Gaussian-based reward for continuous score prediction.
3. Incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms for training stabilization and generalization.

Result: Evaluated OmniQuality-R on aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R effectively unifies multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals, improving policy optimization.

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, especially in non-English settings.

Method: Leverages rich fine-grained supervision (region-text matching, long-caption modeling), multiple discriminative objectives, and Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss. Trained on large-scale English and Chinese data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on 29 datasets across 8 tasks in both English and Chinese.

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2 advances bilingual fine-grained alignment. The model, code, and benchmark are released for future research.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models, which is crucial for autonomous driving but often overlooked. They propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework and identify factors influencing both accuracy and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that existing online HD map construction models prioritize accuracy but neglect temporal stability, which is essential for reliable autonomous driving in dynamic environments. Spatial displacement of onboard sensors causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, posing challenges for downstream tasks.

Method: The paper proposes a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. They conduct extensive experiments on 42 models and variants.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) are largely independent performance dimensions. The analysis identifies architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of considering temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy for online HD mapping models. They release a public benchmark to encourage broader focus on stability in the development of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at

*Shasha Guo,Liang Pang,Xi Wang,Yanling Wang,Huawei Shen,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces GeoVLMath, an LVLM tailored for auxiliary-line reasoning in solid geometry, which generates textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions instead of editing diagrams directly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving complex geometric problems with auxiliary lines is challenging for current LVLMs due to their difficulty in rendering geometric precision in image editing.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework is proposed to enhance diagram-text alignment by generating textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions. A cross-modal reward evaluates the alignment between the generated description and a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. A GRPO-based RL stage is used for fine-tuning.

Result: GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often superior performance compared to strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks at the 3B and 7B scales.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of generating textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions and using reinforcement learning to improve diagram-text alignment for geometric problem solving. The proposed GeoVLMath model achieves strong performance on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces FRANCK, a novel source-free object detection framework specifically designed for Detection Transformers (DETRs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFOD approaches lack tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially DETR.

Method: FRANCK uses four key components: Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR), Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB), Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD), and an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI).

Result: FRANCK achieves state-of-the-art performance on several widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale

TL;DR: 利用预训练的文本到视频模型进行视点规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索利用视频生成先验知识，从给定的4D场景中进行视点规划的可行性，因为视频内部包含具有自然视点的动态场景。

Method: 提出了一个两阶段范例，以适应预训练的T2V模型进行视点预测。首先，通过自适应学习分支将4D场景表示注入到预训练的T2V模型中。然后，将视点提取公式化为混合条件引导的相机外参去噪过程。具体来说，通过将生成的视频和4D场景作为输入，在预训练的T2V模型上进一步引入了相机外参扩散分支。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法优于现有的竞争对手，并且消融研究验证了关键技术设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 证明了视频生成模型在现实世界中进行4D交互的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

*Xianlin Liu,Yan Gong,Bohao Li,Jiajing Huang,Bowen Du,Junchen Ye,Liyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new panoptic symbol spotting framework for CAD drawings is proposed, incorporating textual annotations and explicit modeling of relationships among primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook textual annotations and lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, leading to incomprehensive understanding of CAD drawings.

Method: A Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex CAD drawings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating textual annotations and explicitly modeling relationships among primitives in CAD drawings.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S: A streaming audio-visual LLM for processing long videos (3-hour, 1 FPS, 360p) under a fixed memory budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-understanding LLMs struggle to scale to continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams. Offline methods require adapting frame rates, while streaming methods lose information by merging or discarding tokens.

Method: The model introduces a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations and a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation.

Result: The 8B-parameter video-SALMONN S model achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines on long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro).

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens.

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Motivation: 现有的病理基础模型依赖于大量数据和参数，导致计算成本高昂，难以实际应用。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏，将千兆规模模型的知识迁移到大规模模型，仅使用1K目标癌症的病理切片。

Result: 蒸馏后的大规模模型在多个基准测试中超越了同等规模的SOTA模型，甚至在某些基准测试中超过了千兆规模的教师模型和超大规模模型。同时，蒸馏模型表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，对于癌症特定应用，所提出的蒸馏方法是一种数据和参数高效的方式，可以在没有过高计算负担的情况下实现千兆规模水平的性能。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

TL;DR: A unified framework for high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from monocular videos with defocus and motion blur.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods can't handle both defocus and motion blur simultaneously due to differences in their formation and the difficulty of estimating accurate blur kernels.

Method: Estimates per-pixel blur kernels using a blur prediction network with blur-aware sparsity and uses dynamic Gaussian densification to improve novel view synthesis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic Gaussian Splatting in the presence of defocus and motion blur.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Method: A custom lightweight CNN (LightPneumoNet) with four blocks of stacked convolutional layers, trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images with preprocessing and data augmentation.

Result: Achieved 0.942 accuracy, 0.92 precision, 0.96 F1-Score, and 0.99 sensitivity on an independent test set, with a model size of only 1.48 MB.

Conclusion: LightPneumoNet's efficiency enables deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an automated framework for scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images using object detection, OCR, and a Large Language Model (LLM) agent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scale bar detection in SEM images is time-consuming and error-prone.

Method: The framework uses a multi-modal approach with Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG), object detection, a hybrid OCR system, and an LLM agent for analysis and verification.

Result: The model achieves high precision in object detection (100% precision, 95.8% recall, 99.2% mAP) and the hybrid OCR system outperforms standalone engines (89% precision, 65% recall, 75% F1 score).

Conclusion: The automated method enhances efficiency and accuracy in scale bar detection and extraction, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis.

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

TL;DR: This paper explores using deep learning-based visual anomaly detection (VAD) to automatically identify interesting events in underwater video monitoring for marine biodiversity assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection of underwater video footage is impractical due to the vast volume of data. The paper aims to automate the process of identifying interesting events.

Method: The authors introduce a new multi-annotator benchmark dataset (AURA) for underwater VAD and evaluate four VAD models across two marine scenes. They also explore frame selection strategies.

Result: The performance of VAD models varies significantly and is sensitive to training data and the variability in defining "normal" scenes. Soft and consensus labels improve performance.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a practical approach for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring using VAD, highlighting the importance of robust frame selection and sufficient training data.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper compares the cost-effectiveness of supervised object detection (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5) across different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to determine when the higher accuracy of supervised learning justifies the cost of annotation, versus the annotation-free but less accurate zero-shot VLM inference.

Method: The authors performed systematic evaluation on 1,000 COCO images and 200 product images, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling, to establish quantitative break-even thresholds.

Result: Supervised YOLO achieves higher accuracy on standard categories, but zero-shot Gemini is more cost-effective for diverse product categories and at high inference volumes. The optimal architecture selection depends on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements.

Conclusion: The study provides decision frameworks for selecting the optimal object detection architecture based on cost-effectiveness analysis considering factors beyond technical performance metrics.

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a face similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from restricted receptive fields, providing a locally additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. The fidelity of post-hoc methods to the model's actual reasoning is uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors propose a face similarity metric that defines the similarity between two face images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores.

Result: The proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel face similarity metric that offers inherent interpretability by breaking down global similarity into local patch contributions, achieving competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Motivation: 目前的ControlNet倾向于重现原始训练分布，限制了其增强效果。为了解决这个问题，本研究旨在利用来自未标记域的数据来训练ControlNet。

Method: 该方法引入不确定性概念到控制机制中，区分图像是否属于下游任务的训练分布。通过结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，最终的ControlNet可以从目标域生成带有标签的高不确定性数据。

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像分割任务中，该方法成功合成了来自家庭OCT域的带注释图像，显著提高了分割结果，无需额外监督。与风格迁移相比，不确定性引导能够在没有严格学习图像风格的情况下实现任意域转移。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的不确定性引导的ControlNet方法能够有效利用未标记数据，生成高质量的合成数据，用于增强下游任务的训练，并在视网膜OCT图像分割和交通场景实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

TL;DR: A new graph-based framework represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs to address multi-label classification challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing demand for automated tools for CT scans and the challenges of capturing long-range dependencies in 3D data with existing methods.

Method: A 2.5D approach using spectral graph convolution on axial slice triplets represented as nodes in a structured graph.

Result: Achieves strong cross-dataset generalization and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the broader applicability of the approach through transfer experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

TL;DR: This paper introduces LikePhys, a training-free method to evaluate intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately evaluating intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models is challenging because it's difficult to separate physics correctness from visual appearance.

Method: The paper uses a curated dataset of valid-invalid video pairs and evaluates models based on their Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), which aligns with human preference.

Result: The study benchmarks intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models, analyzes how model design and inference settings affect this understanding, and highlights domain-specific capacity variations.

Conclusion: Current models struggle with complex and chaotic dynamics, but there's a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM for modeling and editing expressive 3D head avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DMMs struggle to represent complex full-head shapes due to their strict topology and linear nature. Previous methods for localized editing have expensive latent sizes.

Method: The paper proposes imHead, which uses a single compact identity space and an intermediate region-specific latent representation for local edits. They also curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities.

Result: imHead demonstrates expressive power in representing diverse identities and expressions, outperforming previous approaches. It also provides an interpretable solution for localized 3D face manipulation.

Conclusion: The paper presents imHead as an effective solution for modeling and editing 3D head avatars, offering improvements in representation and manipulation capabilities compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

Conclusion: EvoCAD能够高效生成拓扑结构正确的对象，并通过提出的新指标进行评估，这些指标补充了现有的空间指标。

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

Motivation: 缺乏高质量、公开可用的体数据图像分割标注，尤其是在细胞迁移等复杂动态目标上。

Method: 人工标注MDA231人乳腺癌细胞的3D时序图像，并与已有的跟踪标记和2D金标准进行对比，同时与自动生成的silver truth进行比较。

Result: 验证了标注与已有跟踪标记的一致性，分割精度在inter-annotator variability范围内，且更能代表输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 提出的标注可用于测试和训练细胞分割，或分析高度动态物体的3D形状。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

*Krittin Chaowakarn,Paramin Sangwongngam,Nang Htet Htet Aung,Chalie Charoenlarpnopparut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces NV3D, a novel 3D object detection model that uses local features from voxel neighbors, specifically normal vectors, to improve detection accuracy while reducing data processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D object detection methods using multi-modal setups struggle with feature alignment, and local feature extraction can be too simplistic. The paper aims to address these limitations by using normal vectors to capture richer local information.

Method: The paper proposes NV3D, which computes normal vectors per voxel using KNN and PCA. It introduces two sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling. Element-wise attention fusion is applied to combine voxel features and normal vector features.

Result: NV3D achieves superior performance in car and cyclist detection on the KITTI dataset. Without sampling, it outperforms the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% mAP for car and cyclist detection, respectively. With sampling, it still exceeds the baseline by 1.56% mAP in car detection while filtering out approximately 55% of voxels.

Conclusion: NV3D effectively utilizes normal vectors and attention mechanisms to improve 3D object detection accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the potential of local geometric features in enhancing object detection performance.

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

*Dipkamal Bhusal,Michael Clifford,Sara Rampazzi,Nidhi Rastogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FACE, a framework for concept extraction that uses NMF with KL divergence regularization to ensure alignment between the model's original and concept-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept discovery methods often fail to align extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process, compromising explanation faithfulness.

Method: The proposed FACE framework augments Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leiback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization term and incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning.

Result: FACE outperforms existing methods across faithfulness and sparsity metrics on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets.

Conclusion: FACE promotes faithful local linearity in the learned concept space by minimizing the KL divergence, which bounds the deviation in predictive distributions.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

TL;DR: This paper introduces CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm that enables LLMs and VLMs to "think with images" for solving math problems requiring visual assistance. It includes a new dataset Math-VR and a method to convert images to code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and VLMs struggle with math problems needing visual assistance because they are limited to text or lack precision in generating interleaved text and images.

Method: The authors propose CodePlot-CoT, which uses a VLM to generate text reasoning and plotting code, rendering images as "visual thought." They also introduce Math-VR, a large-scale dataset, and a specialized image-to-code converter.

Result: The CodePlot-CoT model achieves up to a 21% increase in performance compared to the base model on the Math-VR benchmark.

Conclusion: The paper introduces a new approach to multimodal mathematical reasoning, providing a large-scale dataset, benchmark, and strong model.  The datasets, code, and pretrained models are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中实现了高达2.3倍的加速，同时略微提高了性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的方法有效地降低了HMR模型的计算成本，同时保持了甚至提高了性能。

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the long-tail problem in real-world point cloud datasets, where some rare classes have limited instances.

Method: The method involves creating a synthetic dataset (RareBoost3D) with more instances of rare classes and proposing a cross-domain semantic alignment method (CSC loss) to align features across different domains.

Result: The experimental results show that the proposed alignment method significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that the RareBoost3D dataset and the CSC loss effectively improve the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models by addressing the long-tail problem and leveraging both synthetic and real-world data.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

TL;DR: This paper introduces EarthWhere, a new benchmark for evaluating the image-grounded geolocation capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in open-world settings. It assesses visual recognition, reasoning, and evidence use across two scales: country-level and street-level. The benchmark includes a scoring mechanism for intermediate reasoning steps. Benchmarking 13 VLMs reveals limitations in current models, including biases and challenges in leveraging web search and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack comprehensive evaluation in the challenging task of image-grounded geolocation in real-world open environments.

Method: The authors created the EarthWhere benchmark, comprising 810 globally distributed images and two geolocation scales. They evaluated 13 VLMs using final-prediction metrics (location accuracies) and intermediate reasoning chain scores based on visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted thinking score.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieved the best average accuracy (56.32%), while GLM-4.5V reached 34.71%. The study revealed that web search and reasoning don't always improve performance, and models exhibit regional biases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential and limitations of current VLMs in achieving robust, fine-grained localization, emphasizing issues like bias and the effective use of web search and reasoning. The benchmark is open-sourced for further research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Motivation: 现有的场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单的风格，缺乏自由风格转换的能力。

Method: 设计了一个特征注入模块，该模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力来有效地传递风格特征。此外，通过在每个去噪步骤中应用基于距离的变化掩模，引入了一个区域控制机制，从而实现精确的空间控制。为了进一步提高视觉质量，我们结合了一个基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块，以增强风格的丰富性。

Result: 在场景文本风格转换方面取得了卓越的性能，在视觉保真度和文本保留方面都优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: SceneTextStylizer 在场景文本风格转换方面取得了卓越的性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a calibration-free uncertainty indicator for generative models in inverse problems, sensitive to distribution shift without requiring retraining or knowledge of the training distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing uncertainty quantification methods either require calibration datasets, provide heuristic estimates, or quantify uncertainty from model capacity rather than distribution shift. The paper aims to address the problem of hallucinated features when test images lie outside the training distribution.

Method: The paper proposes an instance-level uncertainty indicator based on the hypothesis that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable under random measurement variations, while out-of-distribution reconstructions exhibit greater instability. This stability is used as a proxy for detecting distribution shift.

Result: The proposed OOD indicator is demonstrated on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, showing that reconstructions of OOD digits have higher variability and reconstruction error, validating the indicator.

Conclusion: The results suggest pairing generative priors with lightweight guardrails, allowing aggressive measurement reduction for in-distribution cases while warning when priors are applied out of distribution.

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IUT-Plug enhances VLMs with structured reasoning using an Image Understanding Tree (IUT) to improve consistency in image-text generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle to maintain logic, object identity, and style in complex multimodal image-text generation scenarios.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) Dynamic IUT-Plug extracts hierarchical symbolic structures from visual scenes. (2) Coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis ensures cross-modal consistency.

Result: IUT-Plug improves accuracy on benchmarks and reduces context drift in multimodal question answering.

Conclusion: IUT-Plug effectively alleviates context drift across diverse multimodal QA scenarios by incorporating structured reasoning.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

*Sanchit Sinha,Oana Frunza,Kashif Rasul,Yuriy Nevmyvaka,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Chart-RVR, a framework that fine-tunes LVLMs for robust and explainable chart reasoning using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and verifiable rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs struggle with out-of-distribution chart data and provide poor explanations.

Method: The framework uses three rewards: chart-type classification, table reconstruction and process conformity coupled with Group Relative Policy Optimization.

Result: Chart-RVR outperforms supervised fine-tuning on in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, improving rationale fidelity and achieving state-of-the-art results on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Chart-RVR improves the robustness, explainability, and reliability of chart-reasoning models by using verifiable rewards with GRPO.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

Motivation: 多模态模型容易过拟合强势模态，导致弱势模态的贡献被抑制。

Method: 1.  提出多模态Mixup（MM），在聚合的多模态特征层应用Mixup策略，生成虚拟特征-标签对，以减轻过拟合。 2. 提出平衡多模态Mixup（B-MM），基于各模态对学习目标的相对贡献，动态调整各模态的混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能有效提高泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的MM和B-MM方法能够有效解决多模态视频理解中模型过拟合强势模态的问题，并提高模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

TL;DR: ContextGen is a new diffusion transformer framework for multi-instance image generation, guided by layout and reference images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-instance image generation methods lack precise control over object layout and preservation of distinct subject identities.

Method: The paper introduces Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA) mechanisms. They also introduce a new dataset IMIG-100K.

Result: ContextGen outperforms existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity and overall visual quality.

Conclusion: ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art for multi-instance image generation.

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学图像中准确分割肿瘤和邻近正常组织对于手术计划和肿瘤分期至关重要。然而，基础模型在复杂、低对比度的背景下难以专注于前景区域，导致难以区分恶性肿瘤和正常器官。

Method: 提出了前景感知频谱分割（FASS）框架，包括前景感知模块、基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块和边缘约束模块。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的实验表明，FASS框架在所有指标上均表现出优异的性能，尤其是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面。

Conclusion: FASS框架显著提高了低对比度图像的分割效果，为更多样化和复杂的医学成像场景中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

*Sanchit Sinha,Guangzhi Xiong,Aidong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces COCO-Tree, a novel approach that uses neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to augment VLM outputs, enhancing their linguistic reasoning and compositional generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern vision language models (VLMs) struggle with compositional reasoning, failing to understand the interactions between objects, attributes, and relations in an image. Existing methods to improve this either require significant resources or lack interpretable reasoning.

Method: The paper proposes COCO-Tree, which augments VLM outputs with neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs. It employs a beam search-inspired reasoning process.

Result: COCO-Tree improves compositional generalization by 5-10% over baselines on four compositionality benchmarks (Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe) across seven different open-source VLMs.

Conclusion: COCO-Tree significantly enhances VLMs' compositional reasoning abilities by integrating neurosymbolic concept trees and providing interpretable rationales for VLM predictions.

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel framework that extends the Mamba state space model to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for video-based human pose estimation (VHPE).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VHPE methods struggle to balance global and local dynamic modeling within a single structure, leading to suboptimal performance, and suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability for high-resolution sequences.

Method: The paper proposes a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba for efficient global representation extraction and a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches on four benchmark datasets while achieving better computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel and effective framework for VHPE that leverages the Mamba state space model to separately learn global and local spatiotemporal representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

Motivation: 现有技术缺乏严格的、以推理为中心的基准测试，以系统地评估统一模型在复杂视觉任务中的理解和生成对齐以及泛化潜力。

Method: 设计了一个综合的基准测试GIR-Bench，从三个互补的角度评估统一模型：理解-生成一致性（GIR-Bench-UGC）、以推理为中心的文本到图像生成（GIR-Bench-T2I）和编辑中的多步骤推理（GIR-Bench-Edit）。

Result: 通过对各种统一模型和仅生成系统的广泛消融研究表明，统一模型在推理驱动的视觉任务中表现更强，但理解和生成之间仍然存在差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench提供了一种细粒度和可解释的评估方法，并减轻了来自流行的 MLLM-as-a-Judge 范式的偏差。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Result: Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance on several embodied reasoning benchmarks and demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance on the WidowX and Google Robot benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper provides a step towards bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning, offering insights into mitigating the domain shift between pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data through Vlaser and analysis of VLM initialization strategies.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable

tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations

Motivation: 现有的文本引导扩散模型在真实人脸编辑任务中难以保持ID和结构一致性。

Method: 将人脸表征分解为ID和属性特征，并将它们作为联合条件来指导反演和反向扩散过程，从而独立控制ID和属性。

Conclusion: 该方法在人脸编辑任务中，能够在保持ID和结构一致性的同时，精确地进行面部属性操作。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its

TL;DR: LSVOS challenge at ICCV 2025 overview: Includes Classic VOS, Referring VOS, and the new Complex VOS (MOSEv2) track which focuses on more realistic and challenging scenarios.  MOSEv2 uses J&dF metric. Highlights top solutions and trends like LLM/MLLM and memory-aware propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push long-term consistency and generalization in video object segmentation beyond curated benchmarks by introducing more challenging, realistic scenarios.

Method: The challenge uses three tracks: Classic VOS, Referring VOS, and Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Datasets and protocols are defined for each.  Metrics used are J, F, and J&F for VOS/RVOS, and J&dF for MOSEv2.

Result: Summarizes datasets and protocols, highlights top-performing solutions, and identifies emerging trends.

Conclusion: The challenge aims to chart future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in real-world scenarios by focusing on trends like LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Motivation: Protect patient privacy while evaluating eye diseases using face images.

Method: Weakly supervised learning and neural identity translation.

Result: Over 98% accuracy in retaining disease features, 100% diagnostic sensitivity, high agreement across eleven eye diseases, anonymizing over 95% of images, and supports secure image reversal.

Conclusion: ROFI effectively protects patient privacy in the digital medicine era.

Abstract: Patient face images provide a convenient mean for evaluating eye diseases,
while also raising privacy concerns. Here, we introduce ROFI, a deep
learning-based privacy protection framework for ophthalmology. Using weakly
supervised learning and neural identity translation, ROFI anonymizes facial
features while retaining disease features (over 98\% accuracy, $\kappa >
0.90$). It achieves 100\% diagnostic sensitivity and high agreement ($\kappa >
0.90$) across eleven eye diseases in three cohorts, anonymizing over 95\% of
images. ROFI works with AI systems, maintaining original diagnoses ($\kappa >
0.80$), and supports secure image reversal (over 98\% similarity), enabling
audits and long-term care. These results show ROFI's effectiveness of
protecting patient privacy in the digital medicine era.

*Bozhou Zhang,Nan Song,Jingyu Li,Xiatian Zhu,Jiankang Deng,Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeerDrive: An end-to-end autonomous driving framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods often underestimate the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution, limiting their ability to make informed decisions.

Method: A framework that predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate scene dynamics and uses this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. It features future-aware planning and iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning.

Result: SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: The future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于监督扩散的降噪框架，用于防御多模态大语言模型中视觉模态的对抗攻击，该框架利用配对的对抗性干净图像数据集对扩散模型进行微调，并结合提示优化来增强对各种攻击的抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御策略（如对抗训练和输入净化）存在局限性：对抗训练通常只提高对已知攻击的鲁棒性，而计算成本很高；传统的净化方法往往图像质量下降，且对复杂的多模态任务泛化性不足。因此，需要一种更有效的防御方法来保护视觉模态。

Method: 提出了一种基于监督扩散的降噪框架，该框架利用配对的对抗性干净图像数据集对扩散模型进行微调，并提供定向的、特定于任务的指导。此外，还结合了提示优化作为补充防御机制。

Result: 在图像字幕和视觉问答任务上的大量实验表明，该方法不仅大大提高了鲁棒性，而且对未知的对抗性攻击表现出很强的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 基于监督扩散的降噪方法对于多模态防御是有效的，为在现实世界应用中更可靠和安全地部署多模态大语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决计算机视觉中模型识别训练数据未见过的属性和对象组合的问题，应对需要每个可能组合的训练数据的组合挑战。视觉原语的外观具有高度的上下文相关性，有效建模这种上下文性和固有的组合性对于鲁棒的组合零样本识别至关重要。

Method: 系统地回顾了最先进的CZSL方法，引入了一种基于解耦的分类方法，包括四种方法：无显式解耦、文本解耦、视觉解耦和跨模态解耦。

Conclusion: 本综述旨在作为基础资源，以指导和激励该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to predict future 3D scene motion from a single image by learning motion priors from real-world videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to learn semantically and functionally meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos to predict future 3D scene motion.

Method: The method involves a pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation, a large-scale database of MoMaps from real videos, and a diffusion model trained on these representations.

Result: The approach generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates a new pipeline for 2D video synthesis by generating a MoMap, warping an image, and completing the warped point-based renderings, resulting in plausible 3D scene motion generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DiPro, a framework for modeling disease progression using longitudinal multimodal data (EHR and CXRs). It addresses redundancy in CXR sequences and temporal misalignment between EHR and CXR data through region-aware disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Utilizing longitudinal multimodal data (EHR and CXRs) for modeling disease progression is challenging due to redundancy in CXR sequences and temporal misalignment between sparse imaging and continuous EHR data.

Method: DiPro disentangles static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in CXRs and aligns them with EHR data via local and global synchronization to model progression pathways.

Result: Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show DiPro effectively extracts temporal clinical dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance on disease progression identification and ICU prediction tasks.

Conclusion: DiPro effectively models disease progression by addressing challenges in longitudinal multimodal data through region-aware disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment of CXR and EHR data.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 研究文本生成图像模型在计数方面的能力，发现仅靠扩大数据集和模型规模无法提高计数准确率，并提出通过注入计数感知布局信息来控制数量的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本生成图像模型在计数方面表现不佳，无法准确遵循文本提示中的计数指令。研究旨在探讨扩散模型是否可以通过扩大数据集和模型规模来生成文本提示中指定数量的正确对象。

Method: 1. 构建了两个合成数字基准数据集：GrayCount250和NaturalCount6，用于严格和可重复的评估。
2. 通过实验验证了放大规模假设不成立，即更大的模型和数据集本身并不能提高计数准确率。
3. 分析发现，扩散模型倾向于依赖噪声初始化，而不是文本提示中明确指定的数量。
4. 提出了一种通过将计数感知布局信息注入到噪声先验中来控制数量的有效策略。

Result: 提出的方法显著提高了计数准确率，在GrayCount250上从20.0%提高到85.3%，在NaturalCount6上从74.8%提高到86.3%，证明了其在不同设置中的有效泛化能力。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在生成图像时，对于数量的控制不能简单地依赖于扩大模型和数据集的规模，而是需要更加明确地引导模型关注和利用文本提示中的数量信息。通过引入计数感知布局信息，可以有效提高模型生成图像中物体的数量准确性。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

TL;DR: CoPRS: A Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning segmentation methods lack interpretability and semantic detail due to directly connecting hidden features or representing positions in text.

Method: Introduces CoPRS, which uses MCoT to create a heatmap-based positional prior, enhancing interpretability. A learnable concentration token aggregates image and reasoning text features to generate this prior, which is then decoded into precise masks.

Result: CoPRS matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RefCOCO and ReasonSeg datasets.

Conclusion: The study supports the utility of using this paradigm to bridge reasoning and segmentation, demonstrating advantages in concentration driven by reasoning and more precise mask prediction.

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

*Xiang Ma,Litian Xu,Lexin Fang,Caiming Zhang,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces PICO, a novel framework for cross-modal alignment that suppresses style interference during embedding interaction by quantifying the probability of each feature column representing semantic information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cross-modal alignment methods ignore the impact of non-semantic (style) information, leading to information bias or loss.

Method: The proposed PICO framework quantifies the probability of each feature column representing semantic information and uses it as a weight during embedding interaction. A prototype iterative construction method ensures the reliability of the semantic probability, using a performance feedback-based weighting function.

Result: Experiments show that PICO outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.2%-14.1% on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: PICO effectively suppresses style interference and improves cross-modal alignment performance.

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有视觉语言模型在文化知识理解方面的鲁棒性和泛化能力，现有评估主要集中在静态回忆或孤立的视觉基础。

Method: 构建了一个多模态、多元文化的基准BLEnD-Vis，包含313个文化相关的问答模板，覆盖16个地区，并生成了三种多项选择题形式：文本基线（地区到实体）、反向文本（实体到地区）和VQA风格版本（带生成图像）。

Result: 当前视觉语言模型在文化知识方面存在明显的脆弱性；在语言改述下性能下降，视觉线索通常有助于提高性能，但低跨模态一致性突出了稳健整合文本和视觉理解的挑战，尤其是在低资源地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis提供了一个关键的测试平台，用于系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础，揭示了局限性，并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language

challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our

*Shengming Yuan,Xinyu Lyu,Shuailong Wang,Beitao Chen,Jingkuan Song,Lianli Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces FlexAC, a training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs, balancing creativity and faithfulness by controlling associative reasoning strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack the flexibility to modulate associative reasoning strength, limiting their adaptability across factual and creative scenarios.

Method: The paper investigates internal mechanisms of associative behavior in MLLMs, identifies the role of middle layers, and uses hallucination to derive steering vectors. FlexAC then constructs associative steering vectors and incorporates task-specific associative vectors.

Result: FlexAC achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR.

Conclusion: FlexAC effectively enables flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for automatically detecting educational content (literacy and math) in online videos, using a class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach with a multimodal transformer network. A new dataset, APPROVE, is also presented for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing consumption of online media by children highlights the need for tools to filter appropriate educational content.

Method: A class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach is used with a multimodal transformer network to capture visual and audio cues. The approach minimizes distances between class prototypes and samples from the same class, while maximizing distances to samples from other classes.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on the APPROVE dataset, YouTube-8M, and COIN.

Conclusion: The paper presents a data-driven approach and a new dataset (APPROVE) for detecting educational content in online videos, demonstrating improved performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

*Masoumeh Chapariniya,Pierre Vuillecard,Jean-Marc Odobez,Volker Dellwo,Teodora Vukovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了仅通过面部表情的纯动态成分（不依赖静态面部外观）来识别个体的可能性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究面部动态信息是否包含个体身份信息，以及这种信息在社会认知和临床评估中的潜在应用。

Method: 利用FLAME 3D形变模型解耦面部形状和表情动态，提取视频中的表情和下颌系数，并使用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行分类。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集上，模型在1429人分类中达到61.14%的准确率，远高于随机水平。同时引入漂移噪声比（DNR）来量化形状和表情分离的可靠性，发现DNR与识别性能呈负相关。

Conclusion: 面部动态信息包含个体特有的身份特征，对社会认知和临床评估具有潜在意义。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

*Weixuan Li,Quanjun Li,Guang Yu,Song Yang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Yupeng Liu,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DTEA, a novel medical image segmentation model that uses a new skip connection framework with STR and EPG modules to improve segmentation accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image segmentation methods struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios.

Method: The proposed DTEA model features a new skip connection framework with the Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG) modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic hypergraph, and EPG assesses channel stability after perturbation and filters high-entropy channels.

Conclusion: The DTEA model improves medical image segmentation accuracy and generalization ability by enhancing structural and semantic representation and emphasizing clinically important regions.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

### [166] [Exploring and Leveraging Class Vectors for Classifier Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11268)
*Jaeik Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Class Vectors for flexible image classifier editing, enabling tasks like unlearning and adaptation without extensive retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classifier editing methods are inflexible, costly (require retraining), and haven't been thoroughly explored for image classification. The predefined behaviors of trained classifiers make post-hoc editing difficult, especially for forgetting or adapting.

Method: The paper proposes Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning in the latent space. Editing is achieved by steering latent features along these vectors or mapping them to weight space.

Result: Class Vectors effectively capture semantic shifts, and their linearity and orthogonality enable efficient concept editing via class arithmetic. Demonstrated utility in unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and trigger optimization.

Conclusion: Class Vectors provide a flexible and efficient way to edit image classifiers for various applications, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

TL;DR: EEMS: A novel medical image segmentation model using edge-aware enhancement and multi-scale prompt generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is important for clinical applications but faces challenges due to ambiguous edges and noise.

Method: Combines Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) for edge perception, Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU) for target localization, and Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) for feature fusion.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and reliability on the ISIC2018 dataset.

Conclusion: EEMS is a reliable clinical tool for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges
and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation,
combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt
Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency
feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level
semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach,
ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,
enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018
confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

### [168] [Human Uncertainty-Aware Data Selection and Automatic Labeling in Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11295)
*Jian Lan,Zhicheng Liu,Udo Schlegel,Raoyuan Zhao,Yihong Liu,Hinrich Schütze,Michael A. Hedderich,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores the impact of human uncertainty (HU) in Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets on the performance of large vision-language models (VLMs) during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). It introduces HaDola, a framework that leverages HU to improve VLM accuracy and calibration with less training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that VLMs rely heavily on SFT with large labeled datasets which is costly, and real-world datasets exhibit human uncertainty (HU) that standard SFT disregards. The paper aims to understand how HU affects SFT and how to effectively leverage it in training.

Method: The paper first evaluates VLMs across varying HU levels, then introduces HaDola, a framework with four stages: discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and training, to identify harmful samples, prioritize informative ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set.

Result: The experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. The findings suggest that high-HU samples contribute little or even degrade model performance, and naively training on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size. HaDola reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more accurate and better calibrated.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

*Lin Zhu,Yifeng Yang,Xinbing Wang,Qinying Gu,Nanyang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel OOD score, named {"Delta}Energy, to improve VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes is important.

Method: Introduce a novel OOD score, named {"Delta}Energy, {"Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {"Delta}Energy (termed EBM).

Result: {"Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Extensive experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by 10% to 25% in AUROC.

Conclusion: This paper developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection.

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Sketch2Symm, a two-stage method for 3D reconstruction from sketches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract and sparse nature of sketches makes 3D reconstruction challenging due to lack of semantic and geometric information.

Method: The method enriches sparse sketch representations via sketch-to-image translation and incorporates symmetry constraints as geometric priors.

Result: The method achieves superior performance compared to existing methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score.

Conclusion: The effectiveness of the proposed semantic bridging and symmetry-aware design is verified.

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

Method: 该研究考虑了预处理图像、洪水 mapping 和水深场的集合，评估在法国加龙河 2019 年和 2021 年两次洪水事件。

Result: 结果表明，斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围的估计，变化达数平方公里。此外，洪水 mapping 方法的选择和调整也会影响性能。虽然监督方法优于非监督方法，但调整后的非监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可以获得相当的结果。来自预处理和洪水 mapping 步骤的复合不确定性也给水深场估计带来了很高的可变性。

Conclusion: 本研究强调了考虑整个处理流程的重要性，包括预处理、洪水 mapping 和水深估计方法及其相关的超参数。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Conclusion: The unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves

Conclusion: MMAP框架通过解决局部特征提取的不足和全局空间上下文覆盖不足的问题，显著提高了从组织学图像预测空间基因表达的性能。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes why reasoning-based IQA models generalize well and proposes a more efficient method (RALI) that achieves comparable performance with significantly reduced parameters and inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reasoning-based IQA models have good generalization but high energy usage and latency.  The paper aims to understand the mechanisms behind their generalization and reduce their computational cost.

Method: The paper first analyzes how RL training helps MLLMs convert visual representations to text. Then, it proposes RALI, a contrastive learning method to align images with generalizable text representations, avoiding the need for reasoning processes and LLMs.

Result: RALI achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models but uses less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.

Conclusion: The paper identifies the conversion of visual representations to compact, cross-domain aligned text representations as the source of generalization in reasoning-based IQA models. Based on this, RALI is proposed and validated as a much more efficient alternative.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

*Wenyuan Zhang,Jimin Tang,Weiqi Zhang,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel method for modeling reflections from 2D images using Gaussian Splatting, enhancing photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that existing methods for material inference in Gaussian Splatting lack sufficient constraints, leading to illumination aliasing and reduced generalization, especially with limited environment modeling.

Method: The method enforces multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading, tracks photometric variations across views to identify reflective regions, and introduces an environment modeling strategy using ray tracing with 2DGS to handle indirect illumination.

Result: The experiments show that the method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that multi-view consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in

Result: The proposed method, LM-EEC, achieves state-of-the-art results on the EgoExo4D benchmark, significantly outperforming existing methods and the SAM 2 baseline.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

### [178] [Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness on Inland Waterways: A YOLO-Based Fusion of Satellite and AIS for Vessel Characterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11449)
*Geoffery Agorku,Sarah Hernandez,Hayley Hames,Cade Wagner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新框架，将高分辨率卫星图像与船舶自动识别系统（AIS）的轨迹数据融合，以提高内陆水道的海洋领域感知（MDA）能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于AIS的内陆水道监测系统存在局限性，需要利用非合作的卫星图像进行补充，并融合视觉检测与AIS数据，以识别暗船、验证合作交通并支持高级MDA。

Method: 使用YOLO v11目标检测模型来检测和识别船舶和驳船，并通过船舶类型、驳船覆盖、操作状态、驳船数量和行驶方向进行分类。开发了一个包含4,550个实例的标注数据集，这些数据来自5,973平方英里的密西西比河下游图像。

Result: 在保留的测试集上进行评估，船舶分类（拖船、起重驳船、散货船、货船和料斗驳船）的F1评分为95.8％；驳船覆盖（覆盖或未覆盖）检测的F1评分为91.6％；操作状态（分段或运动中）分类的F1评分为99.4％。方向性（上游，下游）的准确度为93.8％。驳船数量估计的平均绝对误差（MAE）为2.4艘驳船。跨地理上不相交的河段的空间可转移性分析表明，准确性保持高达98％。

Conclusion: 结果表明，将非合作卫星遥感与AIS融合是可行的。这种方法能够实现近乎实时的船队库存，支持异常检测，并生成用于内陆水道监视的高质量数据。未来的工作将扩大带注释的数据集，整合时间跟踪，并探索多模态深度学习，以进一步提高操作可扩展性。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

### [179] [Coupled Degradation Modeling and Fusion: A VLM-Guided Degradation-Coupled Network for Degradation-Aware Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11456)
*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VGDCFusion, a novel network that tightly couples degradation modeling with the fusion process, using VLMs for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression, to address the performance degradation of existing IVIF methods when handling degraded images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods suffer from performance degradation when handling degraded images due to the decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion, often relying on manual pre-processing techniques.

Method: The paper proposes VGDCFusion, which includes a Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) for modality-specific degradation awareness and a Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) for cross-modal degradation perception.

Result: VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed VGDCFusion effectively addresses the challenge of fusing degraded infrared and visible images by tightly coupling degradation modeling with the fusion process and leveraging VLMs for degradation-aware perception.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our

Conclusion: 该方法通过视图对齐增强了 3D 高斯的几何表示，从而改进了表面重建和新视角合成。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Result: 在标准法线积分基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，速度比像素级方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地处理大型法线贴图，并在速度和精度上都有所提高。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Motivation: 现有3D数据集和评估基准往往侧重于动态场景或动态情境的孤立研究，导致理解不完整。为了克服这些限制，需要一个更全面的数据集来支持情境感知变化理解。

Method: 利用11K人类对环境变化的观察，建立共享心智模型和共享情境意识，结合LLM，整合自中心和以外中心视角以及分类和坐标空间关系。提出了SCReasoner，一种高效的3D MLLM方法，能够以最小的参数开销和无需额外的语言解码器令牌实现有效的点云比较。

Result: Situat3DChange任务的全面评估突出了MLLM在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。在数据缩放和跨域迁移上的额外实验证明了使用Situat3DChange作为MLLM训练数据集的任务不可知有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange数据集和SCReasoner模型为动态场景和情境理解提供了有力的工具，并为未来人机协作研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有技术缺乏对复杂环境的整体场景理解，因此为视障人士在极端或复杂环境中提供行走辅助仍然是一个巨大的挑战。该研究受到视障人士的实际需求的驱动。

Method: 构建了一个模拟的多模态数据集mmWalk，该数据集集成了多视角传感器和面向可访问性的特征，用于户外安全导航。该数据集包含120个手动控制的、场景分类的行走轨迹，包含超过559k张全景图像以及RGB、深度和语义模态。此外，构建了mmWalkVQA，一个包含超过69k个视觉问答三元组的VQA基准。

Conclusion: 该数据集能够有效提升多模态行走辅助的性能。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates Massive Activations (MAs) in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) and proposes a Detail Guidance (DG) strategy to enhance local detail fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand the function of Massive Activations (MAs) in DiTs for visual generation, which are currently poorly understood.

Method: The method involves systematically investigating MAs, finding their distribution is modulated by timestep embeddings and they play a key role in local detail synthesis. Based on these insights, a training-free self-guidance strategy called Detail Guidance (DG) is proposed, which constructs a degraded model by disrupting MAs to guide the original network.

Result: The results show that DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that MAs play a key role in local detail synthesis and the proposed DG strategy effectively enhances local detail fidelity for DiTs.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

TL;DR: This paper introduces ODI-Bench, a new benchmark for omnidirectional image understanding, and Omni-CoT, a training-free method to improve MLLMs' performance on ODIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with understanding omnidirectional images (ODIs), which are important for VR/AR applications.

Method: The authors created ODI-Bench, a dataset of 2,000 ODIs with 4,000 QA pairs, and Omni-CoT, a chain-of-thought reasoning method.

Result: Experiments on ODI-Bench show that existing MLLMs perform poorly on ODIs, but Omni-CoT significantly improves their performance.

Conclusion: The paper identifies a gap in MLLM performance on ODIs and proposes a new benchmark and method to address it.

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Motivation: Reducing the resource-intensive nature of chest X-ray classification by using foundation models to decrease the need for large annotated datasets.

Method: Systematically evaluating power-law fits to predict the training size needed for specific ROC-AUC thresholds, testing various pathologies and foundation models like XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP.

Result: XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50 baseline; learning curve slopes from only 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus.

Conclusion: The study enables practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential samples for targeted performance, leveraging the capabilities of foundation models.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the

pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

Conclusion: 快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合，能够为城市场景理解实现可扩展、高质量的训练数据创建。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

*Hongyu Zhu,Lin Chen,Mounim A. El-Yacoubi,Mingsheng Shang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MS-Mix，一个自适应的情感敏感增强框架，用于优化多模态情感分析中的样本混合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态情感分析模型受限于多模态标注数据的稀缺，直接应用Mixup会引入标签模糊和语义不一致的问题。

Method: 提出情感感知样本选择（SASS）策略，情感强度引导（SIG）模块，以及情感对齐损失（SAL）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MS-Mix始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS-Mix为稳健的多模态情感增强建立了一个新的标准。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

### [191] [ACE-G: Improving Generalization of Scene Coordinate Regression Through Query Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11605)
*Leonard Bruns,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Áron Monszpart,Sowmya Munukutla,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ACE-G, a novel scene coordinate regression method for visual relocalization that improves generalization by separating the coordinate regressor and map representation, pre-training a transformer on a large dataset to generalize from mapping to unseen query images, and demonstrating increased robustness on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods for visual relocalization lack generalization capabilities when query image conditions differ significantly from training views due to overfitting. The training objective encodes training views directly into the coordinate regressor's weights, limiting its ability to handle unseen conditions.

Method: The proposed method, ACE-G, separates the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code. The transformer is pre-trained on a large dataset of scenes to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images. This separation and pre-training strategy allows the model to learn generalizable features.

Result: ACE-G demonstrates significantly increased robustness on multiple challenging relocalization datasets compared to existing SCR methods. The method also maintains an attractive computational footprint.

Conclusion: By separating the coordinate regressor and map representation and pre-training a transformer, ACE-G overcomes the generalization limitations of previous SCR methods, leading to more robust visual relocalization performance.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpVid是一个新的基准，旨在系统地评估MLLM在科学实验视频上的表现，揭示了现有MLLM在细粒度感知、程序理解和科学推理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长期性，无法充分理解MLLM的真实能力，特别是在湿实验室环境中。

Method: ExpVid从同行评审的视频出版物中提取，构建了一个新的三级任务层次结构，模拟科学过程：细粒度感知、程序理解和科学推理。采用以视觉为中心的注释管道，结合自动生成和多学科专家验证，确保任务需要视觉基础。

Result: 对19个领先的MLLM在ExpVid上进行评估，发现它们擅长粗粒度识别，但在消除细微细节、跟踪随时间的状态变化以及将实验程序与科学结果联系起来方面存在困难。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著的性能差距，尤其是在高阶推理方面。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了一个诊断工具，还为开发能够成为科学实验中值得信赖的合作伙伴的MLLM制定了路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

*Feng Zhang,Haoyou Deng,Zhiqiang Li,Lida Li,Bin Xu,Qingbo Lu,Zisheng Cao,Minchen Wei,Changxin Gao,Nong Sang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces LLF-LUT++, a pyramid network for photo enhancement that balances performance and efficiency by integrating global and local operators through Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing photo enhancement methods either have high performance but are computationally expensive or are efficient but have inadequate performance. This paper aims to address this limitation.

Method: The method uses an image-adaptive 3D LUT for global tonal characteristics and Laplacian filters for local edge detail refinement. It also uses a spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor.

Result: LLF-LUT++ achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on the HDR+ dataset and processes 4K resolution images in 13 ms on a single GPU.

Conclusion: The proposed approach performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

TL;DR: IVEBench is a new benchmark suite for instruction-guided video editing assessment, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by providing a diverse video database, comprehensive task coverage, and a three-dimensional evaluation protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating instruction-guided video editing due to limited source diversity, narrow task coverage, and incomplete evaluation metrics.

Method: The authors introduce IVEBench, a benchmark suite comprising a diverse database of 600 high-quality videos, covering 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories. Prompts were generated and refined using large language models and expert review. A three-dimensional evaluation protocol is established, encompassing video quality, instruction compliance, and video fidelity, using both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based assessments.

Result: Experiments demonstrate IVEBench's effectiveness in benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, providing comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Conclusion: IVEBench is a valuable tool for evaluating instruction-guided video editing methods, offering improvements over existing benchmarks in terms of diversity, task coverage, and evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的、类别无关的框架，可以从单个RGB-D图像同时预测6D姿势、大小和密集形状，无需模板、CAD模型或测试时的类别标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法要么依赖于特定于对象的先验知识（例如CAD模型或模板），要么由于姿势-形状纠缠和多阶段流程而在类别之间的泛化能力有限。

Method: 该模型融合了视觉基础模型的密集2D特征和部分3D点云，使用Transformer编码器（由专家混合增强），并采用并行解码器进行姿势-大小估计和形状重建，从而实现28 FPS的实时推理。

Result: 在SOPE数据集中的149个类别的合成数据上进行训练，并在四个不同的基准（SOPE、ROPE、ObjaversePose和HANDAL）上进行评估，涵盖300多个类别。在已见类别上实现了最先进的精度，同时对未见的真实世界对象表现出非常强的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为机器人和具身人工智能中的开放集6D理解建立了新标准。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

*Boyang Zheng,Nanye Ma,Shengbang Tong,Saining Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) to replace VAEs in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), addressing limitations like outdated backbones and weak representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of VAEs in DiTs, such as outdated backbones, low-dimensional latent spaces, and weak representations that limit generative quality.

Method: The method involves replacing VAEs with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming RAEs. The paper also analyzes and addresses the challenges of using high-dimensional latent spaces with diffusion transformers.

Result: The approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses and demonstrates strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance).

Conclusion: RAE offers clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training.

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT360: A DiT-based framework for panoramic image generation using hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large-scale, high-quality, real-world panoramic data hinders geometric fidelity and photorealism.

Method: Inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation at image and token levels, including perspective image guidance, panoramic refinement, circular padding, yaw loss, and cube loss.

Result: Better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics in text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks.

Conclusion: DiT360 effectively addresses the challenges of panoramic image generation by focusing on data-centric solutions and hybrid training techniques.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

### [198] [Point Prompting: Counterfactual Tracking with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11715)
*Ayush Shrivastava,Sanyam Mehta,Daniel Geng,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a zero-shot point tracking method using pretrained video diffusion models. It leverages the connection between video generation and tracking by prompting the model to track points with visual markers during video regeneration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to utilize the capabilities of video diffusion models, which are designed to synthesize motion, for the task of point tracking without requiring specific training data.

Method: The method involves placing a distinctively colored marker at the query point in the initial frame and then regenerating the video from an intermediate noise level using a video diffusion model. The initial frame is used as a negative prompt to ensure the marker's visibility throughout the generated frames.

Result: The experiments demonstrate that this method outperforms existing zero-shot tracking methods and achieves performance comparable to specialized self-supervised models, even in the presence of occlusions.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that pretrained video diffusion models can be effectively used for zero-shot point tracking by prompting them to visually mark and track points during video regeneration. The emergent tracks are robust and competitive with specialized methods.

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Motivation: 现有的非刚性对象新视角渲染方法通常需要稀疏的 RGB 输入，这在实际应用中是一个限制。该论文旨在探索是否可以仅从事件流中学习类似的模型。

Method: 该方法通过以下方式回归可变形的 3D 高斯 Splatting 表示：1) 将估计模型的输出与 2D 事件观测空间相关的损失，以及 2) 从事件生成的二元掩码训练的粗糙 3D 变形模型。

Result: 在现有的合成和新记录的包含非刚性对象的真实数据集上进行的实验比较表明，Ev4DGS 的有效性，并且与可以在我们设置中应用的多个朴素基线相比，它具有优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文证明了仅使用单目事件流进行非刚性物体新视角渲染的可行性，并提出了一个有效的方法 Ev4DGS。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

*Yuan Liao,Rafael H. M. Pereira,Jorge Gil,Silvia De Sojo Caso,Laura Alessandretti*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a space-time accessibility (SPA) metric to understand how accessibility shapes participation in leisure activities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of conventional accessibility measures that overlook the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily routines.

Method: The method involves using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents in the Paris region to assess how SPA influences total travel time and leisure participation, measured as the diversity of leisure activity locations. Structural equation modeling is used to reveal the relationships between SPA, travel time, and leisure diversity.

Result: The results show that most individuals choose destinations aligned with their SPA-defined opportunity sets. SPA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights the value of person-centered, capability-informed accessibility metrics for understanding inequalities in urban mobility and informing transport planning strategies.

Abstract: Understanding how accessibility shapes participation in leisure activities is
central to promoting inclusive and vibrant urban life. Conventional
accessibility measures often focus on potential access from fixed home
locations, overlooking the constraints and opportunities embedded in daily
routines. In this study, we introduce a space-time accessibility (SPA) metric
rooted in the capability approach, capturing feasible leisure opportunities
between home and work given a certain time budget, individual transport modes,
and urban infrastructure. Using high-resolution GPS data from 2,415 residents
in the Paris region, we assess how SPA influences total travel time and leisure
participation, measured as the diversity of leisure activity locations. Spatial
patterns show that most individuals-especially active transport users-choose
destinations aligned with their SPA-defined opportunity sets, underscoring the
metric's validity in capturing capability sets. Structural equation modeling
reveals that SPA directly fosters leisure diversity but also reduces travel
time, which in turn is associated with lower diversity. These findings
highlight the value of person-centered, capability-informed accessibility
metrics for understanding inequalities in urban mobility and informing
transport planning strategies that expand real freedoms to participate in
social life across diverse population groups.

TL;DR: A new network pruning framework, IGPrune, is proposed to simplify complex social and biological networks by iteratively removing edges based on their contribution to task-relevant mutual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of analyzing and interpreting complex social networks with dense and overlapping connections.

Method: The method is a multi-step network pruning framework that uses information theory and gradient boosting to iteratively remove edges based on their contribution to task-relevant mutual information. The proposed method is named IGPrune.

Result: Experiments on social and biological networks show that IGPrune retains critical structural and functional patterns and reveals interpretable backbones.

Conclusion: The pruned networks reveal interpretable backbones, highlighting the method's potential to support scientific discovery and actionable insights in real-world networks.

Abstract: Social networks often contain dense and overlapping connections that obscure
their essential interaction patterns, making analysis and interpretation
challenging. Identifying the structural backbone of such networks is crucial
for understanding community organization, information flow, and functional
relationships. This study introduces a multi-step network pruning framework
that leverages principles from information theory to balance structural
complexity and task-relevant information. The framework iteratively evaluates
and removes edges from the graph based on their contribution to task-relevant
mutual information, producing a trajectory of network simplification that
preserves most of the inherent semantics. Motivated by gradient boosting, we
propose IGPrune, which enables efficient, differentiable optimization to
progressively uncover semantically meaningful connections. Extensive
experiments on social and biological networks show that IGPrune retains
critical structural and functional patterns. Beyond quantitative performance,
the pruned networks reveal interpretable backbones, highlighting the method's
potential to support scientific discovery and actionable insights in real-world
networks.

Motivation: LLMs lack benchmarks for evaluating their alignment with real-world social attitudes.

Method: A comprehensive benchmark is created from ISSP survey data, aggregating over 480,000 real respondent records from more than 30 countries, spanning 10 sociological domains and over 40 demographic attributes.

Result: LLMs achieve only 30-40% accuracy in simulating individuals in complex survey scenarios, with statistically significant differences across domains and demographic subgroups.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in survey scenarios, including insufficient individual-level data coverage, inadequate scenario diversity, and missing group-level modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential for simulating human
social behaviors and interactions, yet lack large-scale, systematically
constructed benchmarks for evaluating their alignment with real-world social
attitudes. To bridge this gap, we introduce SocioBench-a comprehensive
benchmark derived from the annually collected, standardized survey data of the
International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). The benchmark aggregates over
480,000 real respondent records from more than 30 countries, spanning 10
sociological domains and over 40 demographic attributes. Our experiments
indicate that LLMs achieve only 30-40% accuracy when simulating individuals in
complex survey scenarios, with statistically significant differences across

of current LLMs in survey scenarios, including insufficient individual-level

Community Notes for faster and more reliable health misinformation governance.
CrowdNotes+ integrates two complementary modes: (1) evidence-grounded note
augmentation and (2) utility-guided note automation, along with a hierarchical
three-step evaluation that progressively assesses relevance, correctness, and
helpfulness. We instantiate the framework through HealthNotes, a benchmark of
1.2K helpfulness-annotated health notes paired with a fine-tuned helpfulness
judge. Experiments on fifteen LLMs reveal an overlooked loophole in current
helpfulness evaluation, where stylistic fluency is mistaken for factual
accuracy, and demonstrate that our hierarchical evaluation and LLM-augmented
generation jointly enhance factual precision and evidence utility. These
results point toward a hybrid human-AI governance model that improves both the
rigor and timeliness of crowd-sourced fact-checking.

*Sebastián Brzovic,Cristóbal Rojas,Andrés Abeliuk*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study introduces a multiscale entropy framework using spectral graph reduction to analyze complex networks across various domains, revealing distinct structural regimes and improved predictability compared to single-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the structural complexity and predictability of complex networks is a central challenge. Existing methods focus on single-scale representations, overlooking hierarchical patterns.

Method: A multiscale entropy framework is introduced, applying spectral graph reduction to quantify structural entropy as the network is coarsened.

Result: The framework uncovers consistent entropy profiles across network families, revealing three structural regimes—stable, increasing, and hybrid—that align with domain-specific behaviors. Multiscale entropy improves network predictability compared to single-scale models.

Conclusion: Multiscale entropy is a powerful and scalable tool for characterizing, classifying, and assessing the structure of complex networks.

Abstract: Understanding the structural complexity and predictability of complex
networks is a central challenge in network science. Although recent studies
have revealed a relationship between compression-based entropy and link
prediction performance, existing methods focus on single-scale representations.
This approach often overlooks the rich hierarchical patterns that can exist in
real-world networks. In this study, we introduce a multiscale entropy framework
that extends previous entropy-based approaches by applying spectral graph
reduction. This allows us to quantify how structural entropy evolves as the
network is gradually coarsened, capturing complexity across multiple scales. We
apply our framework to real-world networks across biological, economic, social,
technological, and transportation domains. The results uncover consistent
entropy profiles across network families, revealing three structural
regimes$\unicode{x2013}$stable, increasing, and hybrid$\unicode{x2013}$that
align with domain-specific behaviors. Compared to single-scale models,
multiscale entropy significantly improves our ability to determine network
predictability. This shows that considering structural information across
scales provides a more complete characterization of network complexity.
Together, these results position multiscale entropy as a powerful and scalable
tool for characterizing, classifying, and assessing the structure of complex
networks.

*Yufa Zhou,Yixiao Wang,Xunjian Yin,Shuyan Zhou,Anru R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a geometric framework to model and analyze the reasoning process of LLMs as flows in their representation space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs reason and whether they internalize logic beyond surface form.

Method: Proposing a geometric framework that models LLM reasoning as flows, disentangling logical structure from semantics, and using learned representation proxies for visualization and quantification.

Result: LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation space, and logical statements act as local controllers of these flows' velocities.

Conclusion: The work provides a conceptual foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning, offering a new perspective for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为 AETHER 的轻量级框架，通过兴趣点 (POI) 引导的多模态对齐，将 AlphaEarth (AE) 适应于以人为中心的城市分析，从而提高土地利用分类和经济社会映射的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的地球观测 (EO) 驱动的表示在捕捉城市的功能和社会经济维度方面存在局限性，因为它们主要编码物理和光谱模式，而不是人类活动或空间功能。

Method: AETHER 通过将 AE 嵌入与 POI 的文本表示对齐，利用轻量级多模态对齐来丰富物理基础的 EO 特征，从而获得关于城市功能和社会经济背景的语义线索。

Result: 在伦敦的实验结果表明，AETHER 在土地利用分类 F1 值方面相对提高了 7.2%，在社会经济映射的 Kullback-Leibler 散度方面相对降低了 23.6%。

Conclusion: AETHER 通过将 EO 与以人为中心的语义相结合，推动地理空间基础模型朝着整合物理形式和功能含义的通用城市表示发展。

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨用户记忆如何影响大型语言模型的情感推理能力，特别是当AI助手记住用户的个人信息后，是否会对其情感压力产生不同的解读。

Method: 通过在人类验证的情感智能测试中评估15个大型语言模型，研究用户记忆对情感智能的影响。

Result: 发现相同的情境与不同的用户资料配对后，会产生系统性差异的情感解读。在多个高性能的LLM中，优势群体的情感解读更为准确，并且在情感理解和支持性建议任务中，LLM在不同的人口因素上表现出显著差异。

Conclusion: 个性化机制可能会将社会等级制度嵌入到模型的情感推理中，从而强化社会不平等。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a low-cost, instruction-based intervention to improve LLMs' logical fallacy classification by decomposing the task into procedural steps and using a knowledge graph.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with logical reasoning due to their reliance on System 1 processing, leading to hallucinations and poor accuracy in fallacy classification.

Method: The authors create a stepwise instruction dataset that breaks down fallacy classification into simple binary questions and incorporates a final verification step using a relational knowledge graph.

Result: The procedural intervention significantly improves LLM logical fallacy classification and enhances the transparency of their decision-making.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address LLM reasoning deficits by using instruction-based interventions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

*Pratik S. Sachdeva,Tom van Nuenen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究通过LLM辩论，在多轮对话环境中考察了LLM在复杂道德推理中的价值观对齐问题。研究发现，不同LLM在同步和轮询设置下表现出显著的行为差异，价值观模式也存在分歧，且辩论形式对模型行为有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在日常生活中，LLM越来越多地应用于敏感场景，理解其在复杂道德推理中的价值观至关重要。以往研究主要集中在单轮 prompt 上，而忽略了多轮对话中价值观的涌现。

Method: 使用 LLM 辩论，让三个模型（GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet 和 Gemini 2.0 Flash）对 Reddit “Am I the Asshole” 社区的 1000 个日常困境进行集体指责。采用同步（并行响应）和轮询（顺序响应）两种形式，测试顺序效应和判决修改。

Result: 研究发现，在同步设置中，GPT 表现出很强的惯性（0.6-3.1% 的修改率），而 Claude 和 Gemini 则灵活得多（28-41%）。价值观模式也存在分歧：GPT 强调个人自主和直接沟通，而 Claude 和 Gemini 优先考虑移情对话。某些价值观在推动判决改变方面特别有效。辩论形式对模型行为有很强的影响：相对于 Claude，GPT 和 Gemini 表现出高度的一致性，其判决行为受到顺序效应的强烈影响。

Conclusion: 多轮交互中，辩论形式和模型特定行为会影响道德推理，社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于系统如何构建对话。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Serafín Moral,José Ramón Trillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new distance measure method for Random Permutation Sets (RPS) based on the cumulative Jaccard index, addressing limitations of existing methods and offering higher sensitivity and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring the distance between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory (RPST).

Method: The paper introduces a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity between two permutations and further proposes a distance measure method for RPSs based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix.

Result: The proposed method overcomes the shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme distance, and also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Conclusion: The proposed distance measure offers improvements over existing methods by incorporating a top-weightiness property and providing parameters for adjusting weight and truncation depth, as demonstrated through numerical examples.

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a black-box attack framework called RIPRAG to poison RAG systems by injecting poisoned documents, manipulating LLMs to generate attacker-desired text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on white-box attacks on simplified RAG architectures, which is unrealistic. This paper aims to investigate more complex and realistic black-box scenarios.

Method: The paper uses Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation of poisoned documents, aligning them with the target RAG system's preferences. The attacker only knows whether the poisoning succeeds or not.

Result: The proposed method effectively executes poisoning attacks against complex RAG systems, achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The study highlights deficiencies in current defensive methods and provides insights for LLM security research.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

*Enric Junque de Fortuny,Veronica Roberta Cappelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether LLMs exhibit genuine strategic thinking in non-cooperative games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to understand if LLMs can perform strategic thinking, which involves forming beliefs about other agents, evaluating actions, and making choices based on those beliefs, in domains like negotiation and policy design.

Method: The authors develop a framework to disentangle beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static games, analyzing models' choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new context-free game.

Result: The results show that current LLMs exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted reasoning depths, self-limit their depth of reasoning when unconstrained, and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents. They also develop internally generated heuristic rules of choice under increasing complexity.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic formation can emerge from language modeling objectives, providing a basis for studying strategic cognition in artificial agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

TL;DR: 文章提出了一种新的LLM工作流程优化范式，该范式通过最小化预期失败质量来直接解决工作流程的失败分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多步执行轨迹简化为简单的成功/失败信号，导致信息崩溃，无法对工作流程的失败分布进行建模。

Method: 提出CE-Graph框架，通过反例池近似失败分布，识别最密集的区域作为重复失败模式，并通过提议和验证机制应用有针对性的、操作约束的图编辑，以贪婪地减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和QA基准测试中，CE-Graph以显着更低的成本实现了更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性并非来自避免失败，而是来自系统地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a graph-theoretic framework for reasoning with inconsistent belief systems by separating credibility from confidence, identifying reasoning zones where classical inference is safe, and modeling belief change through localized updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge of reasoning effectively with belief systems that are rarely globally consistent.

Method: The method involves a directed, signed, weighted graph representation of beliefs, a contractive propagation process for determining confidence, and a near-linear procedure for identifying structurally balanced subgraphs as reasoning zones.  Shock updates are used to model belief change.

Result: The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it. The paper also includes empirical results on synthetic signed graphs, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by providing a novel approach to reasoning with inconsistent beliefs, offering a way to identify and utilize pockets of consistency within a larger contradictory system.

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

TL;DR: SwarmSys is a distributed multi-agent reasoning framework inspired by swarm intelligence, using specialized roles (Explorers, Workers, Validators) for iterative exploration, exploitation, and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks have limitations in scalability and adaptability due to fixed roles or centralized control.

Method: SwarmSys integrates adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism for dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without global supervision.

Result: SwarmSys outperforms baselines in symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and scientific programming tasks, improving accuracy and reasoning stability.

Conclusion: Swarm-inspired coordination is a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and adaptive multi-agent reasoning.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and

*Zeyu Ling,Xiaodong Gu,Jiangnan Tang,Changqing Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE: A self-supervised pretraining framework for talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning synchronization-aware and transferable facial dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams is important for talking-face video analysis.

Method: Masked visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three per-frame prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across four task families: audio-visual stream synchronization, facial emotion and head/face action recognition, visual speech recognition, and visual dubbing.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces StepFly, an agentic framework for automating troubleshooting guides (TSGs) in large-scale IT systems, addressing challenges like TSG quality, complex control flow, data-intensive queries, and parallel execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual execution of troubleshooting guides (TSGs) is slow and error-prone. Existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized support for key challenges in incident management.

Method: The authors present StepFly, a three-stage workflow that includes TSG Mentor for improving TSG quality, offline preprocessing to extract structured execution DAGs and create Query Preparation Plugins (QPPs), and online execution using a DAG-guided scheduler-executor framework with a memory system.

Result: StepFly achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time and token consumption. It also achieves a 32.9% to 70.4% execution time reduction for parallelizable TSGs.

Conclusion: StepFly effectively automates TSGs, improving efficiency and reducing errors in incident management for large-scale IT systems.

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces DixitWorld, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal abductive reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). It features DixitArena (a dynamic, multi-agent environment) and DixitBench (a static QA benchmark).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluations are limited to static, single-agent tasks, failing to capture the complexities of real-world abductive reasoning.

Method: Introduces DixitWorld, comprising DixitArena (for multi-agent, dynamic evaluation of hypothesis generation and selection) and DixitBench (for efficient, controlled evaluation of hypothesis selection).

Result: Smaller open-source models are better storytellers (creative but less discriminative), while larger proprietary models perform better overall, especially as listeners. DixitBench correlates with DixitArena listener performance.

Conclusion: Reveals a trade-off between generative creativity and discriminative understanding in VLMs, highlighting a central challenge for developing balanced vision-language agents.

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为性能感知长度更新（PALU）的简洁推理策略，该策略在减少输出长度的同时提高了准确性，并且适用于不同的领域和模型规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型简洁推理方法依赖于手工设计的启发式方法，难以平衡简洁性和性能，并且难以适应不同的领域和模型规模。

Method: 将简洁推理形式化为约束优化问题，最小化响应长度，同时满足性能约束，然后应用拉格朗日优化将其转换为易于处理的无约束问题。通过三个近似来简化复杂的更新规则：(i) 使用离策略 rollout 估计性能，(ii) 将拉格朗日乘子截断为两个极端值，以及 (iii) 用分位数驱动的长度调整代替基于梯度的更新。

Result: 在 DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B 上应用 PALU，在五个基准测试中，输出长度减少了 65%，同时准确率提高了 15%，优于一系列替代方法。PALU 还被证明可以适应领域（逻辑、STEM 和数学）和模型规模（1.5B、7B、14B）。

Conclusion: PALU 是一种实用且有效的简洁推理方法。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces SAFER, a two-stage risk control framework for large language models in open-ended question answering. It addresses the problem of unrealistic assumptions in existing methods by using abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering to ensure the trustworthiness of outputs with statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring the trustworthiness of large language model outputs is critical in risk-sensitive applications like real-world open-ended question answering, especially because existing methods make unrealistic assumptions about obtaining admissible answers.

Method: The paper proposes a two-stage risk control framework called SAFER, which includes abstention-aware sampling and conformalized filtering. The first stage calibrates a sampling budget, and the second stage applies a conformal risk control method to filter unreliable distractors.

Result: SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and calibration-test split ratios, demonstrating its robustness and high data efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper introduces SAFER, a novel framework that improves the trustworthiness and reliability of large language models in open-ended question answering by addressing the limitations of existing methods and providing statistical guarantees.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Environment Tuning, a new training method for LLM agents that learns from problem instances directly without expert trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like SFT lead to overfitting, and standard RL suffers from cold-start problems and training instability due to data scarcity.

Method: Environment Tuning uses a structured curriculum, environment augmentation with corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards.

Result: The method achieves competitive in-distribution performance and superior out-of-distribution generalization using only 400 problem instances from the BFCL benchmark.

Conclusion: Environment Tuning offers a paradigm shift from SFT to environment-based exploration, enabling more robust and data-efficient agent training.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIXEL的position-wise activation steering框架，用于提高大型语言模型(LLMs)行为控制的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活steering方法依赖于粗糙的启发式方法，缺乏对在何处steer以及如何强烈干预的原则性解释。

Method: PIXEL从双重视角(tail-averaged和end-token)学习一个property-aligned子空间，并通过一个具有闭式解的约束几何目标选择干预强度，从而适应token-level的敏感性，无需全局超参数调整。PIXEL还执行sample-level的正交残差校准以细化全局属性方向，并采用轻量级的position-scanning程序来识别receptive injection sites。

Result: PIXEL在各种模型和评估范例中，持续提高属性对齐的同时，保留了模型的一般能力。

Conclusion: PIXEL为LLMs的可控生成提供了一种实用且有原则的方法。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Adaptive Dual Reasoner (ADR) balances reasoning performance and efficiency by dynamically switching between fast and slow thinking modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) suffer from high computational costs and inference latency due to overthinking.

Method: A two-stage training approach: (1) Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with a hybrid reasoning dataset. (2) Reinforcement learning with Entropy-guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (EHPO).

Result: ADR achieves up to 6.1% performance gain and reduces reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3% on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ADR effectively balances reasoning performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

TL;DR: This paper identifies and analyzes critical neurons in Large Language Models (LLMs) that are crucial for their functionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs, similar to the human brain, contain a small subset of critical neurons essential for core cognitive functions.

Method: Proposes a Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to locate critical neurons in LLMs.

Result: Identifies ultra-sparse critical neuron sets in LLMs, concentrated in outer layers (MLP down_proj components), and demonstrates that disrupting these neurons causes significant performance collapse with sharp phase transitions.

Conclusion: The findings offer insights into LLM robustness and interpretability, potentially guiding the development of more robust model architectures and improving deployment security.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Result: 在三个真实世界的MLRM（Kimi-VL、Ocean-R1、R1-Onevision），跨三个领域的六个基准，和四个基线上进行评估，结果表明，该插件实现了平均5%的改进，高达15%，只有<1%的额外计算和9%的基线延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法是完全模型无关的，并显著提高了现成的MLRM的可靠性和可解释性，从而使其能够安全地部署在高风险应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

TL;DR: Reasoning trace length can be used to estimate the confidence of large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify the uncertainty of LLMs to solve the hallucination problem.

Method: Use reasoning trace length as the confidence estimator in large reasoning models.

Result: Reasoning trace length performs comparably to verbalized confidence. Reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace length and accuracy.

Conclusion: Reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification beyond verbal expressions, and trace length can be used as a practical confidence measure for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation, lacking the cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, which reduces their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios.

Method: The authors propose MedCoAct, a confidence-aware multi-agent framework that integrates specialized doctor and pharmacist agents. They also present a benchmark, DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and treatment workflows.

Result: MedCoAct achieves 67.58% diagnostic accuracy and 67.58% medication recommendation accuracy, outperforming single agent frameworks by 7.04% and 7.08% respectively.

Conclusion: The collaborative approach of MedCoAct generalizes well across diverse medical domains and is especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

*Martina G. Vilas,Safoora Yousefi,Besmira Nushi,Eric Horvitz,Vidhisha Balachandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Latent-Trajectory signals to predict the success of reasoning traces in models, improving efficiency by reducing wasted computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying successful reasoning traces can reduce wasted computation and improve the efficiency of reasoning models.

Method: The authors introduce Latent-Trajectory signals, which characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations during reasoning. They measure the overall change in latent representations, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to which these changes advance toward the final state.

Result: Latent-Trajectory signals predict solution accuracy more reliably than cross-layer metrics and output-based confidence measures. Using these signals to guide answer selection reduces token usage by up to 70% while preserving or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Latent-Trajectory signals offer practical strategies for inference-time efficiency and provide a deeper understanding of how reasoning processes are represented in latent space.

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces ELAIPBench, a new benchmark for evaluating how well LLMs understand AI research papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't accurately assess LLMs' deep comprehension and reasoning abilities regarding full-length academic papers.

Method: The authors created ELAIPBench, a benchmark with 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers, designed by domain experts using an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation process. They tested various LLMs on this benchmark.

Result: The best-performing LLM achieved only 39.95% accuracy, significantly lower than human performance. Thinking mode and RAG systems didn't improve results and sometimes even reduced accuracy.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are far from truly understanding academic papers, as demonstrated by their poor performance on ELAIPBench.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM performance beyond direct matrix mappings by addressing indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.

Method: The paper integrates intuition-based thinking, method-based thinking, and scope extension (vertical, horizontal, temporal, and spatial) organized into knowledge trees and networks.

Result: The paper proposes the entropy of method extension to quantitatively evaluate the system's capacity to solve unseen questions.

Conclusion: This work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs in real-world problem-solving by connecting existing approaches with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework.

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the limitations of gradient-based optimizers like Adam, which require expensive hardware and differentiable architectures.

Method: The paper proposes using evolutionary algorithms (EA4LLM) to optimize LLMs.

Result: The paper successfully demonstrates the capability of EA4LLM to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage.

Conclusion: This work challenges the assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable approach and suggests that evolutionary algorithms can reduce the computational cost of training LLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

*Jiabao Shi,Minfeng Qi,Lefeng Zhang,Di Wang,Yingjie Zhao,Ziying Li,Yalong Xing,Ningran Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for multimodal text-to-image generation, using domain-specialized agents and PPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the difficulty of maintaining semantic alignment and achieving professional-level detail in multimodal text-to-image generation across different visual domains.

Method: The method involves a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with domain-specialized agents, a text enhancement module, and an image generation module. It uses PPO for training and enforces cross-modal alignment through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention, and iterative feedback.

Result: The system significantly enriches generated content and reduces ROUGE-1 scores. Transformer-based fusion methods achieve the highest composite score, while multimodal ensembles show moderate consistency.

Conclusion: The findings suggest that collaborative, specialization-driven architectures hold promise for advancing reliable multimodal generative systems.

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Motivation: Modern techniques like interpretable ML and neural networks haven't been sufficiently explored for learning satisfaction.

Method: APLR model is used to predict learning satisfaction.

Result: Time management, concentration, helpfulness to classmates, and offline course participation significantly impact learning satisfaction. Creative activities don't positively affect it.

Conclusion: Educators can customize instructions based on individual student profiles.

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合框架，该框架将大型语言模型 (LLM) 与动态分层系统中的数学优化相结合，以解决在线叫车平台中供需平衡的挑战。

Motivation: 现有方法要么是强化学习 (RL) 方法，数据效率低，对现实世界动态的建模过于简单，难以执行操作约束；要么是分解的在线优化方法，依赖于手动设计的高级目标，缺乏对低级路由动态的意识。

Method: 利用 LLM 通过自适应生成高级目标来弥合问题分解造成的认知局限性。LLM 充当元优化器，生成语义启发式方法，指导负责约束执行和实时决策执行的低级优化器。这些启发式方法通过闭环进化过程进行改进，该过程由和谐搜索驱动，和谐搜索基于优化层的可行性和性能反馈迭代地调整 LLM 提示。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的混合框架，通过结合大型语言模型和数学优化，有效地解决了在线叫车平台中供需平衡的挑战。实验结果表明，该方法与现有技术相比具有显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Uncertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a model-free method that refines credit assignment in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) by using the model's internal uncertainty signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing RLVR algorithms broadcast a uniform advantage signal, overlooking the importance of uncertain, high-stakes decisions, leading to inefficient exploration and entropy collapse.

Method: UCAS modulates the response-level advantage using model self-confidence and applies a token-level penalty based on logit certainty.

Result: UCAS significantly outperforms strong RLVR baselines on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple model scales, achieving higher rewards and promoting greater reasoning diversity.

Conclusion: UCAS effectively balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, mitigates entropy collapse, and enhances reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning across audio and visual modalities.

Method: A large-scale benchmark with 1000 QA pairs from 628 videos, annotated with reasoning traces and 13 question types.

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench will be released to foster the development of MLLMs with stronger reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconciling deductive completeness with computational efficiency in automated deduction remains a challenge. Traditional methods limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses.

Method: The paper presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal mechanisms of contradiction separation. ETM unifies multiple contradiction-building strategies within a triangular geometric framework.

Result: ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several high-performance theorem provers (CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig), whose competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and theorem proving.

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往工作只考虑SL和NL含义的相似性，忽略了目标SL类型本身的选择。

Method: 利用LLM在多种SL中为每个问题选择最合适的SL，然后将NL问题翻译成目标SL表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法明显优于翻译成单一SL和随机选择SL。在混合数据集上，准确率达到96%，比第二高的准确率提高了25%。

Conclusion: 不同的NL逻辑推理问题对应于不同的最佳SL形式化翻译。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRIFT是一个用于数学定理自动形式化的新框架，它将非正式的数学陈述分解为更小的子部分，以便从数学库中检索前提，并检索说明性定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(llm)难以识别和利用必备的数学知识及其在Lean等语言中的对应形式表示。现有的检索增强自动形式化方法直接使用非正式的语句查询外部库，但忽略了一个根本的限制:非正式的数学语句通常很复杂，并且在底层数学概念上提供的上下文有限。

Method: DRIFT框架将非正式的数学陈述分解为更小的、更易于处理的“子组件”。这有助于有针对性地从Mathlib等数学库中检索前提。此外，DRIFT还检索说明性定理，以帮助模型在形式化任务中更有效地使用前提。

Result: DRIFT在不同的基准测试(ProofNet、ConNF和MiniF2F-test)中持续改进前提检索，与ProofNet上的DPR基线相比，F1分数几乎翻了一番。值得注意的是，DRIFT在out-of-distribution ConNF基准测试中表现出强大的性能，使用GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1分别提高了37.14%和42.25%的BEq+@10。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化的检索有效性在很大程度上取决于特定于模型的知识边界，突出了需要与每个模型的能力相一致的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Motivation: The motivation is to understand and mitigate behaviors in AI that are internally consistent but detached from reality, stemming from the interplay of planning, uncertainty management, and aversive memory.

Method: The method involves cataloging common neurotic modalities in a grid navigation stack, developing lightweight online detectors and escape policies for each, and using genetic-programming based destructive testing to expose systemic failures.

Result: The results show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even with full visibility, and that local fixes are insufficient to address global failures. The destructive testing approach generates adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that addressing neurotic behaviors in AI requires architectural revisions rather than just symptom-level patches, and that destructive testing can help identify areas where such revisions are needed.

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

*Renxuan Tan,Rongpeng Li,Fei Wang,Chenghui Peng,Shaoyun Wu,Zhifeng Zhao,Honggang Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces a game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL framework for MAC protocols in wireless networks, improving generalizability and resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DRL-based MAC protocols lack generalizability and resilience, requiring costly retraining for dynamic environments.

Method: The paper models uplink transmission as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game and uses LLM-driven agents coordinated by PPO to synthesize adaptive MAC protocols, employing protocol action grammar (PAG) for reliability and efficiency.

Result: The proposed framework achieves 77.6% greater throughput and 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines, generalizing well to fluctuating user numbers without retraining.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic LLM-empowered MARL framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional DRL-based MAC protocols, offering significant improvements in throughput, fairness, and generalizability.

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要局限于孤立论文中无工具的任务，缺乏针对真实研究场景中跨论文推理和多工具编排的基准。

Method: 提出了PaperArena基准，它提供了一个模块化和可扩展的平台，用于智能体执行，并提供多模态解析、上下文检索和程序计算等工具。智能体需要在工具的帮助下，整合多篇论文的不同格式的信息，从而产生有根据的答案。

Result: 实验结果表明，即使是最先进的LLM驱动的智能体系统，平均准确率也仅为38.78%。在困难子集上，准确率降至18.47%。所有测试的智能体都表现出低效的工具使用，经常调用比解决任务所需的更多的工具。

Conclusion: PaperArena的提出旨在促进科学发现领域中更强大的智能体的开发和评估。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

*SHengjie Ma,Chenlong Deng,Jiaxin Mao,Jiadeng Huang,Teng Wang,Junjie Wu,Changwang Zhang,Jun wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of "Tool-Call Hacking" in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, where agents give superficially correct tool calls to inflate reward signals without genuinely using the retrieved evidence, leading to mode collapse and spurious grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the failure mode of "Tool-Call Hacking" in RAG agents, where agents inflate reward signals without genuinely leveraging retrieved evidence. This results in repetitive reliance on a single source and weakly supported answers.

Method: The paper proposes Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence, reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU uses a unified step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives.

Result: PoU consistently outperforms strong DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and tool-routing balance across seven QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the necessity of grounding RL-trained agents in the causal use of retrieved information, offering a path toward trustworthy retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Motivation: 传统检索方法无法回答需要上下文推理和跨工件多跳推理的复杂查询。

Conclusion: 该框架为企业环境中的智能知识助手提供了一个可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

TL;DR: Video-STR: A graph-based reinforcement method for precise video spatio-temporal reasoning, addressing limitations in MLLMs by incorporating physical information and using a novel training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with precise spatio-temporal understanding due to overlooking physical information like multi-object layouts and motion in videos, limiting their use in applications requiring high precision.

Method: Introduces Video-STR, a graph-based reinforcement method using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to infer spatio-temporal topology. Also, constructs the STV-205k dataset for spatio-temporal training data.

Result: Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming the base model by 13% on STI-Bench.

Conclusion: The Video-STR approach and the STV-205k dataset are effective for improving spatio-temporal reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.
Code, model, and data will be released.

TL;DR: This paper revisits model interpolation for efficient reasoning, revealing a three-stage evolutionary paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to explore efficient reasoning through model merging, particularly focusing on the simplest interpolation method.

Method: The method involves direct weight interpolation of two models and observation of the resulting three-stage evolutionary behavior on the reasoning trajectory.

Result: Strategic model interpolation surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work demystifies model interpolation and provides a practical framework for crafting models with targeted reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method for failure-cause inference in manufacturing systems using a Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and a Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying the causes of failures is crucial for maintaining and improving production efficiency in manufacturing systems. Existing knowledge bases lack explicit structure and sufficiently long causal chains.

Method: The authors constructed a Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed an FBS model-based maintenance-record accumulation method.

Result: Failure-cause inference using the accumulated maintenance records showed better agreement with expert-provided candidate causes, especially in difficult cases.

Conclusion: The proposed approach can support knowledge sharing across the entire engineering chain and will require further development of inference methods, a user interface, and validation on larger systems.

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

Motivation: 在法律领域中越来越多地部署人工智能系统，但其不透明性对公平性、问责制和信任构成了重大挑战。受影响的个人通常无法获得有意义的解释，这损害了自动化决策的合法性。

Method: 该论文推广了计算论证模型及其在提供法律相关解释中的作用，特别关注其与新兴监管框架（如欧盟通用数据保护条例（GDPR）和人工智能法案（AIA））的对齐。

Result: 该论文分析了不同解释策略的优缺点，评估了它们在法律推理中的适用性，并强调了论证框架如何通过捕捉法律的可撤销、可争议和价值敏感的性质，为可解释的法律人工智能提供特别强大的基础。

Conclusion: 该论文认为计算论证是满足法律领域透明性的技术和规范要求的最佳选择，并确定了开放的挑战和研究方向，包括偏见缓解、司法环境中的实证验证以及遵守不断发展的伦理和法律标准。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based

expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or

Conclusion: The proposed strategy has the potential to improve the sustainability of AI hyperscalers and enhance their environmental, financial, and societal impact.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as

infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms

TL;DR: This paper introduces How², a memory agent framework for lifelong learning in interactive environments. It enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the answers, and reuse them for planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The open-ended nature of how-to questions makes them challenging for AI agents to ask and answer in ways that support efficient planning.

Method: The authors propose How², a framework that allows agents to ask how-to questions, store the answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning.

Result: The evaluation in Plancraft shows that lifelong learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled from the current state.

Conclusion: How² offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive environments.

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment (CDRA) to improve personalized alignment of LLMs by addressing the limitations of current methods in inferring user preferences and defensive reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for aligning LLMs with user preferences fail to infer deep, implicit preferences and lack defensive reasoning, leading to superficial and short-sighted responses.

Method: The paper proposes CDRA, which includes the DeepPref benchmark for preference inference and the Personalized Generative Process Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM) for instilling defensive reasoning. It also introduces Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online reinforcement learning algorithm.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning.

Conclusion: CDRA effectively addresses the challenges of personalized alignment in LLMs by incorporating structured reasoning and preference inference.

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

### [260] [AI Alignment Strategies from a Risk Perspective: Independent Safety Mechanisms or Shared Failures?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11235)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the overlap of failure modes in AI alignment techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the defense-in-depth approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of defense-in-depth as a risk mitigation strategy in AI safety by examining the correlation of failure modes across different alignment techniques.

Method: The authors analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7 failure modes to understand the extent of their overlap.

Result: The paper provides an analysis of the overlap between failure modes of different AI alignment techniques.

Conclusion: The paper discusses the implications of the results for understanding current AI risk levels and prioritizing future AI alignment research.

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

TL;DR: AI-Agent School (AAS) system simulates educational dynamics using self-evolving agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmented teaching process modeling and limited agent performance in simulating diverse educational participants.

Method: Zero-Exp strategy with a continuous experience-reflection-optimization cycle, dual memory base (experience and knowledge), and short-term/long-term memory.

Result: AAS effectively simulates intricate educational dynamics and fosters advanced agent cognitive abilities.

Conclusion: AAS provides a foundation for generating high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data, transitioning from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation".

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Motivation: 研究动机是实现自动化技能分解，并提供一个标准化的评估方法。

Method: 该研究提出了一个评估框架，包括prompting、生成、标准化和与本体节点对齐的流程。同时，引入了语义F1-score和层级感知F1-score两种评价指标。实验采用了zero-shot和leakage-safe few-shot两种prompting策略。

Conclusion: 该框架、基准和指标为开发本体忠实的技能分解系统提供了一个可重复的基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework for improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outcome-supervised reinforcement learning (RLVR) suffers from flawed reasoning and sparse reward signals. Process-level reward models (PRMs) lack generalizability and interpretability.

Method: The DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning process along three dimensions: Confidence, Relevance, and Coherence.

Result: DRM provides effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs, and enhances their reasoning ability on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.

Conclusion: Multidimensional supervision of the reasoning process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the training distribution.

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces DARK, a unified framework for deductive and abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs, using a masked diffusion model with self-reflective denoising and logic-exploration reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods address deductive and abductive reasoning in isolation, despite their synergistic potential.

Method: A masked diffusion model called DARK, featuring self-reflective denoising for hypothesis refinement and logic-exploration reinforcement learning for discovering logical associations.

Result: DARK achieves state-of-the-art performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks across multiple benchmark knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: The unified approach of DARK demonstrates significant benefits for both deductive and abductive reasoning in knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Deductive and abductive reasoning are two critical paradigms for analyzing
knowledge graphs, enabling applications from financial query answering to
scientific discovery. Deductive reasoning on knowledge graphs usually involves
retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Motivation: The increasing use of AI assistants in healthcare and finance necessitates safeguarding private data and compliance, especially with zero data retention policies.

Method: The paper examines the technical architectures of Salesforce AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot, analyzing their implementation of zero data retention policies.

Result: The paper analyzes the technical architecture and deployment of zero data retention policies.

Conclusion: The paper defines the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of zero data retention systems in enterprise apps of large language models.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI

for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a framework for personalized retention strategies in online retail by integrating explainable AI, survival analysis, and RFM profiling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Customer acquisition is more expensive than retention, but current churn models are opaque, hindering effective retention strategies.

Method: The study uses a three-component framework: explainable AI for feature contributions, survival analysis for churn risk, and RFM profiling for customer segmentation.

Result: The framework enables attribution of churn drivers, estimation of intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies reduce attrition and strengthen customer loyalty.

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Method: Introduces ParaCook, a simplified Overcooked-like environment to isolate the challenge of strategic parallel planning. Evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on this benchmark.

Result: Current LLMs achieve suboptimal plans, struggling with parallel actions and coordination. LLMs show potential on abstract tasks focused on high-level parallel optimization.

Conclusion: ParaCook provides a scalable framework for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware multi-agent planning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods limit LLMs to equation proposers. This paper aims to elevate LLMs to autonomous AI scientists.

Method: Wrapping a code interpreter into tools for data analysis and equation evaluation, the agent optimizes equations using these tools over a long horizon.

Result: SR-Scientist outperforms baselines by 6-35% and demonstrates robustness, generalization, and symbolic accuracy.  An end-to-end reinforcement learning framework further enhances capabilities.

Conclusion: SR-Scientist is an effective framework for scientific equation discovery.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that stable allocations are rarely attainable in practice, especially in online settings where agents arrive sequentially to the market, and matchings are often sub-optimal.

Method: The method involves introducing and comparing two complementary measures of instability for allocations with sub-optimal matchings and establishing their connections to the optimality ratio of the underlying matching.

Result: The paper studies the stability performances of randomized algorithms in online assignment games using the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The paper analyzes the stability of allocations with sub-optimal matchings in online assignment games and evaluates the performance of randomized algorithms.

Abstract: The assignment game models a housing market where buyers and sellers are
matched, and transaction prices are set so that the resulting allocation is
stable. Shapley and Shubik showed that every stable allocation is necessarily
built on a maximum social welfare matching. In practice, however, stable
allocations are rarely attainable, as matchings are often sub-optimal,
particularly in online settings where eagents arrive sequentially to the
market. In this paper, we introduce and compare two complementary measures of
instability for allocations with sub-optimal matchings, establish their
connections to the optimality ratio of the underlying matching, and use this
framework to study the stability performances of randomized algorithms in
online assignment games.

Motivation: 现有算法在加性估值下对 MMS 的近似保证存在差距，最坏情况下只能保证 1-1/n^4 的 MMS 值，而现有最佳算法的保证为 3/4 + 3/3836。

Method: 该论文通过改进算法来缩小差距。

Result: 该论文将 MMS 的最佳已知近似保证提高到 10/13。

Conclusion: 该论文提高了 MMS 的近似保证，缩小了理论界限与实际算法性能之间的差距。

Abstract: The maximin share ($\textsf{MMS}$) is the most prominent share-based fairness
notion in the fair allocation of indivisible goods. Recent years have seen
significant efforts to improve the approximation guarantees for $\textsf{MMS}$
for different valuation classes, particularly for additive valuations. For the
additive setting, it has been shown that for some instances, no allocation can
guarantee a factor better than $1-\tfrac{1}{n^4}$ of maximin share value to all
agents. However, the best currently known algorithm achieves an approximation
guarantee of $\tfrac{3}{4} + \tfrac{3}{3836}$ for $\textsf{MMS}$. In this work,
we narrow this gap and improve the best-known approximation guarantee for
$\textsf{MMS}$ to $\tfrac{10}{13}$.

TL;DR: This paper focuses on assigning indivisible chores to agents with different entitlements in the maximin share value (WMMS) context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve the upper bound of O(log n)-WMMS assignment for indivisible chores to a constant-WMMS guarantee.

Method: The paper introduces a new method to achieve a constant-WMMS guarantee.

Result: The paper proves the existence of a 20-WMMS assignment.

Conclusion: The paper improves the upper bound to a constant-WMMS guarantee for assigning indivisible chores, but the constant factor was not optimized.

Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning indivisible chores to agents with
different entitlements in the maximin share value (\MMS) context. While
constant-\MMS\ allocations/assignments are guaranteed to exist for both goods
and chores in the symmetric setting, the situation becomes much more complex
when agents have different entitlements. For the allocation of indivisible
goods, it has been proven that an $n$-\WMMS\ (weighted \MMS) guarantee is the
best one can hope for. For indivisible chores, however, it was recently
discovered that an $O(\log n)$-\WMMS\ assignment is guaranteed to exist. In
this work, we improve this upper bound to a constant-\WMMS\
guarantee.\footnote{We prove the existence of a 20-\WMMS\ assignment, but we
did not attempt to optimize the constant factor. We believe our methods already
yield a slightly better bound with a tighter analysis.}

TL;DR: This paper analyzes a deterministic joint replenishment model using game theory, focusing on cost allocation rules and Nash equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to design cost allocation rules that minimize long-run average system cost in a joint replenishment model, considering that retailers independently choose their replenishment intervals.

Method: The paper introduces cost allocation rules that distribute the major setup cost based on predefined weights and analyzes the monotonicity property of agent better responses to prove the existence of a payoff dominant pure Nash equilibrium.

Result: The analysis reveals that a cost allocation rule leveraging retailers' holding cost rates achieves a near-optimal price of stability (PoS) of 1.25. Another rule without requiring access to retailers' private information also yields a favorable PoS.

Conclusion: The paper identifies cost allocation rules that can efficiently minimize costs in a joint replenishment system while considering the independent decisions of retailers, with some rules achieving near-optimal performance.

Abstract: We analyze an infinite-horizon deterministic joint replenishment model from a
non-cooperative game-theoretical approach. In this model, a group of retailers
can choose to jointly place an order, which incurs a major setup cost
independent of the group, and a minor setup cost for each retailer.
Additionally, each retailer is associated with a holding cost. Our objective is
to design cost allocation rules that minimize the long-run average system cost
while accounting for the fact that each retailer independently selects its
replenishment interval to minimize its own cost. We introduce a class of cost
allocation rules that distribute the major setup cost among the associated
retailers in proportion to their predefined weights. For these rules, we
establish a monotonicity property of agent better responses, which enables us
to prove the existence of a payoff dominant pure Nash equilibrium that can also
be computed efficiently. We then analyze the efficiency of these equilibria by
examining the price of stability (PoS), the ratio of the best Nash
equilibrium's system cost to the social optimum, across different information
settings. In particular, our analysis reveals that one rule, which leverages
retailers' own holding cost rates, achieves a near-optimal PoS of 1.25, while
another rule that does not require access to retailers' private information
also yields a favorable PoS.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: Firms advertise on social networks to increase brand awareness by strategically allocating budgets to network agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Firms need to optimize budget allocation on social networks to maximize brand awareness through direct and indirect marketing.

Method: A two-timescale model is proposed where communication happens faster than strategy updates.

Result: Best response dynamics converge to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, but equilibria may not be socially optimal. Characterization of contest success functions is provided to improve Nash equilibrium.

Conclusion: Experiments validate the performance of contest success functions in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Firms (businesses, service providers, entertainment organizations, political
parties, etc.) advertise on social networks to draw people's attention and
improve their awareness of the brands of the firms. In all such cases, the
competitive nature of their engagements gives rise to a game where the firms
need to decide how to distribute their budget over the agents on a network to
maximize their brand's awareness. The firms (players) therefore need to
optimize how much budget they should put on the vertices of the network so that
the spread improves via direct (via advertisements or free promotional offers)
and indirect marketing (words-of-mouth). We propose a two-timescale model of
decisions where the communication between the vertices happen in a faster
timescale and the strategy update of the firms happen in a slower timescale. We
show that under fairly standard conditions, the best response dynamics of the
firms converge to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. However, such equilibria
can be away from a socially optimal one. We provide a characterization of the
contest success functions and provide examples for the designers of such
contests (e.g., regulators, social network providers, etc.) such that the Nash
equilibrium becomes unique and social welfare maximizing. Our experiments show
that for realistic scenarios, such contest success functions perform fairly
well.

### [276] [Temporal Cooperative Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11255)
*Ashwin Goyal,Drashthi Doshi,Swaprava Nath*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: This paper introduces temporal cooperative games (TCG) where the worth of a coalition depends on the order of agent arrival, unlike classical cooperative games. It identifies a class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), online individual rationality (OIR), and sequential efficiency (SE). Shapley value analogs are constructed, but they conflict with mechanisms satisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, revealing a fundamental tension in defining fair and efficient solutions in TCGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical cooperative game theory doesn't account for the order of agent arrival, which is relevant in many real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper introduces the concept of temporal cooperative games (TCG) and defines three properties: incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), online individual rationality (OIR), and sequential efficiency (SE). It then constructs Shapley value analogs and analyzes their properties in relation to the defined properties.

Result: A class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by I4OA, OIR, and SE is identified. The Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms satisfying these three properties, even for restricted classes of TCGs.

Conclusion: Reward-sharing mechanisms satisfying desirable temporal properties inherently differ from Shapley-inspired ones in TCGs, which opens new questions for defining fair and efficient solution concepts.

Abstract: Classical cooperative game theory assumes that the worth of a coalition
depends only on the set of agents involved, but in practice, it may also depend
on the order in which agents arrive. Motivated by such scenarios, we introduce
temporal cooperative games (TCG), where the worth $v$ becomes a function of the
sequence of agents $\pi$ rather than just the set $S$. This shift calls for
rethinking the underlying axioms. A key property in this temporal framework is
the incentive for optimal arrival (I4OA), which encourages agents to join in
the order maximizing total worth. Alongside, we define two additional
properties: online individual rationality (OIR), incentivizing earlier agents
to invite more participants, and sequential efficiency (SE), ensuring that the
total worth of any sequence is fully distributed among its agents. We identify
a class of reward-sharing mechanisms uniquely characterized by these three
properties. The classical Shapley value does not directly apply here, so we
construct its natural analogs in two variants: the sequential world, where
rewards are defined for each sequence-player pair, and the extended world,
where rewards are defined for each player alone. Properties of efficiency,
additivity, and null player uniquely determine these Shapley analogs in both
worlds. Importantly, the Shapley analogs are disjoint from mechanisms
satisfying I4OA, OIR, and SE, and this conflict persists even for restricted
classes such as convex and simple TCGs. Our findings thus uncover a fundamental
tension: when players arrive sequentially, reward-sharing mechanisms satisfying
desirable temporal properties must inherently differ from Shapley-inspired
ones, opening new questions for defining fair and efficient solution concepts
in TCGs.

Motivation: Understanding the complexity of computing Nash equilibria in stochastic games.

Method: Complexity analysis and game constructions.

Result: Two-player games are PPAD-complete. Rational-valued stationary Nash equilibria are not guaranteed to exist in 3-player games. Computing stationary Nash equilibrium in 4-player games is SqrtSum-hard.

Conclusion: The complexity of computing Nash equilibria in stochastic games varies depending on the number of players.

Abstract: We study the problem of computing stationary Nash equilibria in discounted
perfect information stochastic games from the viewpoint of computational
complexity. For two-player games we prove the problem to be in PPAD, which
together with a previous PPAD-hardness result precisely classifies the problem
as PPAD-complete. In addition to this we give an improved and simpler
PPAD-hardness proof for computing a stationary epsilon-Nash equilibrium. For
3-player games we construct games showing that rational-valued stationary Nash
equilibria are not guaranteed to exist, and we use these to prove
SqrtSum-hardness of computing a stationary Nash equilibrium in 4-player games.

*Drew Springham,Edith Elkind,Bart de Keijzer,Maria Polukarov*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对多胜者赞成选举的算法，该算法在降低通信成本的同时，保证了比例合理代表性+(PJR+)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多候选人的多胜者赞成选举中，选民难以确定他们对所有候选人的偏好。因此，研究在减少通信的情况下，哪些（如果有）公平性保证可以提供是有意义的。

Method: 该论文考虑具有一维偏好的选民，并提出了一个概率偏好模型，其中选民集合由 $\sigma$ 个不同的群体组成；每个群体都与 $\mathbb R$ 的一个区间上的分布相关联，因此每个选民都从与其群体相关的分布中抽取其批准区间的端点。该算法通过查询选民的偏好来计算提供比例合理代表性+(PJR+)的委员会。

Result: 该论文提出的算法在期望上，每个选民进行 $\mathcal{O}(\log( \sigma\cdot k))$ 次查询，其中 $k$ 是期望的委员会规模。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种在降低通信成本的同时，保证比例合理代表性+(PJR+)的多胜者赞成选举算法。

Abstract: In multiwinner approval elections with many candidates, voters may struggle
to determine their preferences over the entire slate of candidates. It is
therefore of interest to explore which (if any) fairness guarantees can be
provided under reduced communication. In this paper, we consider voters with
one-dimensional preferences: voters and candidates are associated with points
in $\mathbb R$, and each voter's approval set forms an interval of $\mathbb R$.
We put forward a probabilistic preference model, where the voter set consists
of $\sigma$ different groups; each group is associated with a distribution over
an interval of $\mathbb R$, so that each voter draws the endpoints of her
approval interval from the distribution associated with her group. We present
an algorithm for computing committees that provide Proportional Justified
Representation + (PJR+), which proceeds by querying voters' preferences, and
show that, in expectation, it makes $\mathcal{O}(\log( \sigma\cdot k))$ queries
per voter, where $k$ is the desired committee size.

TL;DR: KG-MAS: A knowledge graph-enhanced multi-agent system for seamless integration of physical and digital environments in Cyber-Physical Systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional approaches lack semantic richness and flexibility for intelligent, autonomous coordination in heterogeneous CPS.

Method: A centralized knowledge graph (KG) serves as a dynamic, shared world model for a multi-agent system (MAS). Autonomous agents query and update the KG for decision-making and real-time state information. Model-driven architecture facilitates automatic agent generation.

Result: Offers a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for coupling heterogeneous physical and digital robotic environments.

Conclusion: KG-MAS provides a unified, intelligent coordination mechanism by abstracting away underlying communication protocols.

Abstract: The seamless integration of physical and digital environments in
Cyber-Physical Systems(CPS), particularly within Industry 4.0, presents
significant challenges stemming from system heterogeneity and complexity.
Traditional approaches often rely on rigid, data-centric solutions like
co-simulation frameworks or brittle point-to-point middleware bridges, which
lack the semantic richness and flexibility required for intelligent, autonomous
coordination. This report introduces the Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Multi-Agent
Infrastructure(KG-MAS), as resolution in addressing such limitations. KG-MAS
leverages a centralized Knowledge Graph (KG) as a dynamic, shared world model,
providing a common semantic foundation for a Multi-Agent System(MAS).
Autonomous agents, representing both physical and digital components, query
this KG for decision-making and update it with real-time state information. The
infrastructure features a model-driven architecture which facilitates the
automatic generation of agents from semantic descriptions, thereby simplifying
system extension and maintenance. By abstracting away underlying communication
protocols and providing a unified, intelligent coordination mechanism, KG-MAS
offers a robust, scalable, and flexible solution for coupling heterogeneous
physical and digital robotic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively positioning pursuers in pursuit-evasion games without prior knowledge of evader locations remains a significant challenge.

Method: The method involves conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic arrangements and representing them as graphs. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial configurations, termed "hot starts".

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel distances, and enhances containment.

Conclusion: The introduced method showcases clear strategic benefits in pursuit-evasion games.

Abstract: Effectively positioning pursuers in pursuit-evasion games without prior
knowledge of evader locations remains a significant challenge. A novel approach
that combines game-theoretic control theory with Graph Neural Networks is
introduced in this work. By conceptualizing pursuer configurations as strategic

constructed via multi-objective optimization to identify Pareto-optimal
configurations. A Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained on these
Pareto-optimal graphs to generate strategically effective initial
configurations, termed "hot starts". Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the
GCN-generated hot starts provide a significant advantage over random
configurations. In scenarios considering multiple pursuers and evaders, this
method hastens the decline in evader survival rates, reduces pursuer travel
distances, and enhances containment, showcasing clear strategic benefits.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper studies how bias emerges and propagates in multi-agent systems (MAS) composed of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is that while bias in individual LLMs has been studied, the dynamics of bias in MAS, where multiple LLMs collaborate, are largely unexplored.

Method: The method involves simulating social contexts with agents representing different social groups and evaluating system behavior under various interaction and adversarial scenarios. Experiments are conducted on three bias benchmarks.

Result: The results show that MAS are generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias emerging early through in-group favoritism. Cooperative and debate-based communication can mitigate bias amplification, and more robust underlying LLMs improve system stability.

Conclusion: The conclusion highlights critical factors shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Bias in large language models (LLMs) remains a persistent challenge,
manifesting in stereotyping and unfair treatment across social groups. While
prior research has primarily focused on individual models, the rise of
multi-agent systems (MAS), where multiple LLMs collaborate and communicate,
introduces new and largely unexplored dynamics in bias emergence and
propagation. In this work, we present a comprehensive study of stereotypical
bias in MAS, examining how internal specialization, underlying LLMs and
inter-agent communication protocols influence bias robustness, propagation, and
amplification. We simulate social contexts where agents represent different
social groups and evaluate system behavior under various interaction and
adversarial scenarios. Experiments on three bias benchmarks reveal that MAS are
generally less robust than single-agent systems, with bias often emerging early
through in-group favoritism. However, cooperative and debate-based
communication can mitigate bias amplification, while more robust underlying
LLMs improve overall system stability. Our findings highlight critical factors
shaping fairness and resilience in multi-agent LLM systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MASSE, a multi-agent system for structural engineering that uses LLMs to automate workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural engineering workflows have remained largely unchanged for decades despite their economic impact. LLMs have advanced to the point where they can perform tasks relevant to structural engineering.

Method: A training-free LLM-based multi-agent system is used to automate structural engineering workflows.

Result: MASSE reduces expert workload from hours to minutes and enhances reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: Most real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through MASSE.

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{MASSE}$, the first Multi-Agent System for Structural
Engineering, effectively integrating large language model (LLM)-based agents
with real-world engineering workflows. Structural engineering is a fundamental
yet traditionally stagnant domain, with core workflows remaining largely
unchanged for decades despite its substantial economic impact and global market
size. Recent advancements in LLMs have significantly enhanced their ability to
perform complex reasoning, long-horizon planning, and precise tool utilization
-- capabilities well aligned with structural engineering tasks such as
interpreting design codes, executing load calculations, and verifying
structural capacities. We present a proof-of-concept showing that most
real-world structural engineering workflows can be fully automated through a
training-free LLM-based multi-agent system. MASSE enables immediate deployment
in professional environments, and our comprehensive validation on real-world
case studies demonstrates that it can reduce expert workload from approximately
two hours to mere minutes, while enhancing both reliability and accuracy in
practical engineering scenarios.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agent Access Control (AAC), a new framework for managing information flow in LLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional access control mechanisms are insufficient for the autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents.

Method: AAC operates on multi-dimensional contextual evaluation and adaptive response formulation.

Result: The vision is to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable AI safety.

Conclusion: The paper proposes a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.

Abstract: The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional
access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems
designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage
the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position
paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more
sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge
is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We
introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a
dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on
two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses
not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2)
adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions
to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This
vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap
between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new
conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper addresses remote interference (RI) in 5G systems caused by atmospheric ducting. They propose a solution based on angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation and interference cancellation techniques to mitigate RI and improve network performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the critical challenge of remote interference (RI) caused by atmospheric ducting in 5G systems, which severely disrupts uplink (UL) reception at local base stations (BSs).

Method: The method involves analyzing the effect of RI on network performance, identifying the angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI, and designing precoders and combiners that mitigate RI using interference cancellation techniques through null precoding and fractional programming.

Result: The results show a 5.23 dB reduction in normalized mean square error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8 bit/s/Hz at previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.

Conclusion: The conclusion is that the proposed scheme enables uplink communication at low transmit power regimes that were previously unusable due to RI, demonstrating the effectiveness of the interference mitigation techniques.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment of 5G systems, remote interference (RI) caused by
atmospheric ducting has emerged as an occasional, but critical challenge. This
phenomenon occurs when the downlink (DL) signals from distant base stations
(BSs) propagate over long distances through tropospheric ducting, severely
disrupting uplink (UL) reception at local BSs. To address this challenge, we
analyze the effect of RI on network performance, including the channel
estimation phase. We then develop a solution that identifies the
angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI and designs precoders and combiners
that mitigate RI. Our approach employs interference cancellation techniques
through null precoding and fractional programming which enhance the performance
of the network. Interestingly, we show that using our scheme, uplink
communication is possible at low transmit power regimes that were unusable due
to RI. Our results further show a 5.23~dB reduction in normalized mean square
error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8~bit/s/Hz at the
previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.

TL;DR: This paper explores the connections between information theory and differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differential privacy is a standard method for quantifying risks in publishing sensitive data, and it measures risk in terms of differences between probability distributions, a central topic in information theory.

Method: The paper examines key connections between information theory and the formulation/application of differential privacy.

Result: The paper provides an operational significance for relevant information measures in the context of differential privacy.

Conclusion: Differential privacy guarantees can be understood in terms of properties of the channel between the underlying data and the output of the analysis.

Abstract: Since being proposed in 2006, differential privacy has become a standard
method for quantifying certain risks in publishing or sharing analyses of
sensitive data. At its heart, differential privacy measures risk in terms of
the differences between probability distributions, which is a central topic in
information theory. A differentially private algorithm is a channel between the
underlying data and the output of the analysis. Seen in this way, the
guarantees made by differential privacy can be understood in terms of
properties of this channel. In this article we examine a few of the key
connections between information theory and the formulation/application of
differential privacy, giving an ``operational significance'' for relevant
information measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a key establishment protocol resistant to quantum attacks.

Method: Utilizing a universal Gr"obner basis of a polynomial ideal as a private key, leveraging the computational difference between generating the universal Gr"obner basis for decryption and a single Gr"obner basis for encryption.

Result: Analysis of the protocol's security and complexity, with efficient methods to recursively generate the universal Gr"obner basis for toric ideals of graphs.

Conclusion: The protocol's security relies on the difficulty of computing the Gr"obner fan required to construct the universal Gr"obner basis.

Abstract: In this article, we explore the use of universal Gr\"obner bases in
public-key cryptography by proposing a key establishment protocol that is
resistant to quantum attacks. By utilizing a universal Gr\"obner basis
$\mathcal{U}_I$ of a polynomial ideal $I$ as a private key, this protocol
leverages the computational disparity between generating the universal
Gr\"obner basis needed for decryption compared with the single Gr\"obner basis
used for encryption. The security of the system lies in the difficulty of
directly computing the Gr\"obner fan of $I$ required to construct
$\mathcal{U}_I$. We provide an analysis of the security of the protocol and the
complexity of its various parameters. Additionally, we provide efficient ways
to recursively generate $\mathcal{U}_I$ for toric ideals of graphs with
techniques which are also of independent interest to the study of these ideals.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a distributed quantum storage code that maps a quantum message to N storage nodes, robust to specific erasure patterns, and characterizes its capacity for various graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust distributed quantum storage code resilient to erasure patterns.

Method: Using quantum CSS codes related to a classical secure storage problem, employing non-trivial alignment structures for recovery and security. The converse is based on quantum information inequalities.

Result: Characterization of the capacity of distributed quantum storage for various graphs like MDS, wheel, Fano, and intersection graphs.

Conclusion: The coding schemes utilize non-trivial alignment structures, leading to non-trivial quantum codes, with the converse based on quantum information inequalities tailored to the storage graph topologies.

Abstract: A distributed quantum storage code maps a quantum message to N storage nodes,
of arbitrary specified sizes, such that the stored message is robust to an
arbitrary specified set of erasure patterns. The sizes of the storage nodes,
and erasure patterns may not be homogeneous. The capacity of distributed
quantum storage is the maximum feasible size of the quantum message (relative
to the sizes of the storage nodes), when the scaling of the size of the message
and all storage nodes by the same scaling factor is allowed. Representing the
decoding sets as hyperedges in a storage graph, the capacity is characterized
for various graphs, including MDS graph, wheel graph, Fano graph, and
intersection graph. The achievability is related via quantum CSS codes to a
classical secure storage problem. Remarkably, our coding schemes utilize
non-trivial alignment structures to ensure recovery and security in the
corresponding classical secure storage problem, which leads to similarly
non-trivial quantum codes. The converse is based on quantum information
inequalities, e.g., strong sub-additivity and weak monotonicity of quantum
entropy, tailored to the topology of the storage graphs.

### [288] [Soft-Decoding Reverse Reconciliation in Discrete-Modulation CV-QKD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10674)
*Marco Origlia,Marco Secondini*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel reverse reconciliation (RR) technique for PAM (and QAM) in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the secret key rate (SKR) in CV-QKD systems using discrete modulation formats, where Alice only has hard information and needs to recover Bob's key.

Method: Bob discloses a carefully designed soft metric to Alice to help her recover Bob's key without leaking additional information to an eavesdropper. Binary LDPC codes with belief-propagation decoding are used for implementation.

Result: The achievable SKR closely approaches the upper bound, with a significant gain over hard-decision RR. Numerical simulations validate the performance at the coded level.

Conclusion: The proposed RR technique significantly improves the secret key rate in CV-QKD systems with discrete modulation formats compared to hard-decision RR.

Abstract: In continuous-variable quantum key distribution, information reconciliation
is required to extract a shared secret key from correlated random variables
obtained through the quantum channel. Reverse reconciliation (RR) is generally
preferred, since the eavesdropper has less information about Bob's measurements
than about Alice's transmitted symbols. When discrete modulation formats are
employed, however, soft information is available only at Bob's side, while
Alice has access only to hard information (her transmitted sequence). This
forces her to rely on hard-decision decoding to recover Bob's key.
  In this work, we introduce a novel RR technique for PAM (and QAM) in which
Bob discloses a carefully designed soft metric to help Alice recover Bob's key,
while leaking no additional information about the key to an eavesdropper. We
assess the performance of the proposed technique in terms of achievable secret
key rate (SKR) and its bounds, showing that the achievable SKR closely
approaches the upper bound, with a significant gain over hard-decision RR.
Finally, we implement the scheme at the coded level using binary LDPC codes
with belief-propagation decoding, assess its bit-error rate through numerical
simulations, compare the observed gain with theoretical predictions from the
achievable SKR, and discuss the residual gap.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a flexible-sector six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) architecture for wireless communication networks to enhance capacity by adjusting antenna configurations to match user spatial distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to enhance capacity in wireless communication networks by using flexible antenna configurations that adapt to user spatial distribution, unlike conventional fixed-position antennas.

Method: The paper jointly optimizes sector rotation and antenna allocation at the flexible-sector BS to maximize average common throughput using orthogonal multiple access (OMA). It derives closed-form solutions to solve the non-convex optimization problem and analyzes the impact of user spatial distribution.

Result: The results show that equal user distribution over sectors maximizes common throughput. Simulations validate the analysis and demonstrate significant network throughput improvement compared to benchmark schemes.

Conclusion: The flexible-sector 6DMA architecture significantly improves network throughput by dynamically adjusting antenna coverage to match user distribution, making it a promising solution for future wireless communication networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a cost-effective and easily-deployable flexible-sector
six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) architecture for future wireless
communication networks, which enables flexible antenna configurations to match
users' spatial distribution for capacity enhancement. Different from
conventional sectorized base station (BS) with fixed-position antennas (FPAs),
the flexible-sector 6DMA-enabled BS employs multiple directional sector antenna
arrays that can flexibly move along a common circular track. By properly moving
antennas across sectors and rotating all sector antenna arrays synchronously,
the flexible-sector BS can adjust the coverage regions of all sectors with
flexible antenna allocations over them. In particular, we consider the
multiuser downlink communication employing the orthogonal multiple access (OMA)
to serve users in each sector. Under this setup, we jointly optimize the sector
rotation and the antenna allocation at the flexible-sector BS to maximize the
average common throughput achievable for all users based on their spatial
distribution. We solve this non-convex optimization problem by deriving
closed-form solutions and thereby analyze the effect of users' spatial
distribution on the achievable common throughput. It is shown that equal user
distribution over sectors is optimal for maximizing the common throughput.
Motivated by this result, we further develop a low-complexity suboptimal
solution for the sector rotation that minimizes the variance of user numbers
across sectors. Finally, we provide simulation results to verify our analytical
results and validate the performance of our proposed solutions. It is
demonstrated that the flexible-sector BS significantly improves the network
throughput as compared to other benchmark schemes.

TL;DR: This paper explores the use of forward-forward (FF) learning as an alternative to backpropagation (BP) for training autoencoders in communication systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate FF learning as a more efficient and less demanding training method compared to BP, especially when the communication channel is non-differentiable or global derivative information is unavailable.

Method: The authors designed end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and evaluated their performance in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels.

Result: The FF-trained autoencoders demonstrated competitive performance with BP-trained systems in joint coding and modulation and with fixed, non-differentiable modulation. The paper also provides insights into FF network design, training convergence, and memory/processing time savings.

Conclusion: FF learning offers a promising alternative to BP for training autoencoders in communication systems, particularly when dealing with non-differentiable channels or seeking energy efficiency and reduced computational cost.

Abstract: The application of deep learning to the area of communications systems has
been a growing field of interest in recent years. Forward-forward (FF) learning
is an efficient alternative to the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, which is the
typically used training procedure for neural networks. Among its several
advantages, FF learning does not require the communication channel to be
differentiable and does not rely on the global availability of partial
derivatives, allowing for an energy-efficient implementation. In this work, we
design end-to-end learned autoencoders using the FF algorithm and numerically
evaluate their performance for the additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh
block fading channels. We demonstrate their competitiveness with BP-trained
systems in the case of joint coding and modulation, and in a scenario where a
fixed, non-differentiable modulation stage is applied. Moreover, we provide
further insights into the design principles of the FF network, its training
convergence behavior, and significant memory and processing time savings
compared to BP-based approaches.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a new modulation scheme called repeated-and-offset QPSK (RO-QPSK) for satellite-terrestrial converged networks, which has low PAPR and good SINR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The convergence of terrestrial cellular networks with satellite networks motivates the adaptation of OQPSK to DFT-s-OFDM.

Method: The paper introduces RO-QPSK, derives its properties, and compares it with pi/2-BPSK with FDSS. It also provides general SINR expressions for DFT-s-OFDM.

Result: RO-QPSK has a very low PAPR (around 2 dB) and can improve SINR compared to pi/2-BPSK with FDSS in certain channel conditions. Combining FDSS with RO-QPSK can further reduce PAPR while maintaining similar performance.

Conclusion: RO-QPSK is a promising modulation scheme for satellite-terrestrial converged networks due to its low PAPR and good SINR performance.

Abstract: Motivated by the convergence of terrestrial cellular networks with satellite
networks, we consider an adaptation of offset quadrature phase shift keying
(OQPSK), used with single-carrier waveform in traditional satellite systems, to
discrete Fourier transform spread (DFT-s-) orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexed (OFDM) waveform employed in the uplink of terrestrial systems. We
introduce a new order-one constellation modulation, termed repeated-and-offset
QPSK (RO-QPSK), derive its basic properties, and compare it with pi/2-BPSK with
frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS), as supported in 5G. RO-QPSK naturally
produces a Hann-window-shaped spectrum, resulting in a very low maximum
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) on the order of 2 dB. Moreover, with
single-tap equalization and symbol combining at the receiver, RO-QSPK can
improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) compared to pi/2-BPSK with
FDSS, in narrowband and/or moderately frequency-selective channels, as
encountered in satellite communications. A moderate FDSS can also be combined
with RO-QSPK to further reduce the PAPR while providing similar performance. Of
independent interest, general SINR expressions for DFT-s-OFDM are also
provided.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对Reed-Solomon码在$\ell_p$（半）度量空间下的多项式时间列表解码算法，其中$0 < p \leq 2$。该算法在解码距离和码率的权衡上优于之前的算法，并且在随机拉普拉斯和高斯误差下表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Reed-Solomon码纠错算法大多基于汉明距离，但在某些应用中，其他度量标准（如$\ell_p$度量）可能更合适。

Method: 提出了一种新的多项式时间列表解码算法，适用于$\ell_p$（半）度量，其中$0 < p \leq 2$。

Result: 该算法可以解码到任意大的距离（对于相应小的码率），并且在所有解码距离高于一定阈值时，具有更好的距离-码率权衡。此外，论文还证明了GRS码的一个子类的$\ell_1$和$\ell_2$最小距离的下界，表明该列表解码器对于许多感兴趣的参数实际上是一个唯一解码器。最后，论文分析了该算法在随机拉普拉斯和高斯误差下的性能，表明它支持比$\ell_1$和$\ell_2$中相应量的最坏情况误差更大的码率。

Conclusion: 该算法在Reed-Solomon码的$\ell_p$度量下的解码方面取得了显著的改进，并具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science
and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational
complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on
efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated
Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are
focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the
number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other
metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more
appropriate.
  This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized)
Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 < p
\leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean
($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for
correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all
decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds
on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural
subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a
unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our
algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show
that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case
error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).
