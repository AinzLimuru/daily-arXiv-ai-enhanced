### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率的空间细节恢复和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱单图像超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围内的光谱保真度。

Method: 提出光谱-空间解混融合(SSUF)模块，结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取，指导基于ResNet的CNN进行重建；并提出空间-光谱梯度损失函数。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数能有效提升高光谱超分辨率的空间和光谱重建质量，同时减少模型复杂度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，将其与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布和继承偏见的可预测模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得紧迫，这些错误会在部署过程中传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损害。当前对幻觉的理解仍然不完整和碎片化。

Method: 首先提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，然后使用任务-模态交错方法将这些幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 调查发现幻觉往往源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承偏见。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，这项调查为在现实世界生成式AI系统中开发更稳健有效的幻觉解决方案奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法来增强视觉-语言-动作模型对多模态扰动的鲁棒性，通过输出鲁棒性优化和输入一致性训练，在17种扰动下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，需要开发全面的鲁棒性解决方案。

Method: 采用离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声，通过输入变化一致性训练，并使用多臂老虎机算法自动识别最有害的噪声。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，RobustVLA在pi0骨干上获得12.6%绝对增益，在OpenVLA骨干上获得10.4%增益，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在真实FR5机器人上获得65.6%增益。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效提升了VLA模型对多模态扰动的鲁棒性，特别是在真实机器人场景中表现优异。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了能力归因数据筛选(CADC)框架，通过分析模型内在能力而非任务特定启发式方法，仅需5%原始数据即可超越全数据训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型指令调优方法将模型视为黑箱，忽视其潜在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降

Method: 无监督发现内在能力、基于梯度学习轨迹进行影响估计归因训练数据、通过平衡选择和分阶段排序构建能力感知课程

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据在多模态基准测试中超越全数据训练效果

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建块，CADC为指令数据筛选建立了原则性范式

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个问答对，用于评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏难度进展，缺少跨语言任务，且使用真实世界图像通常只包含单一文化，使得基准相对容易。

Method: 构建C³B基准，包含三个难度递增的任务：基础视觉识别、高级文化冲突理解、文化内容生成，涵盖多种文化和语言。

Result: 评估11个开源MLLM显示，当前模型与人类表现之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: C³B对当前MLLM构成重大挑战，鼓励未来研究提升MLLM的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究分析了6个开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见，发现所有模型都系统性地将护士表现为女性、外科医生表现为男性，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意环境中广泛使用，但其输出往往嵌入并放大了社会偏见，需要系统研究这些模型中的性别表征问题。

Method: 使用精心设计的提示词，为5种医院相关职业（心脏病专家、医院主任、护士、护理人员、外科医生）和5种肖像修饰词组合生成100张图像，分析6个先进开源模型的输出。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士均为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型差异明显：Qwen-Image和SDXL强制执行男性主导，HiDream-I1-dev结果混合，FLUX.1-dev在多数角色中偏向女性。肖像修饰词进一步调节性别平衡。

Conclusion: TTI模型中的性别偏见既系统又模型特定，提示词措辞对人口统计结果起关键作用，需要偏见感知设计、平衡默认值和用户指导来防止职业刻板印象的强化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词窃取框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复其模板，将模板窃取视为顺序决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数来有效探索提示空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型促进了文本到图像工作流程的发展，催生了提示词交易市场，但这也带来了安全风险：提示词本身可能被窃取。本文旨在揭示这种漏洞。

Method: 提出RLStealer框架，将模板窃取建模为顺序决策问题，采用基于相似度的多反馈信号作为奖励函数，有效探索提示空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，RLStealer取得了最先进的性能，同时将总攻击成本降低到现有基线的13%以下，能够有效泛化到不同图像风格以高效窃取未见过的提示模板。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了提示词交易中固有的紧急安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场中制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过自动生成反事实图像来测试视觉语言模型解释的忠实性，发现模型解释与真实因果因素之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的预测驱动因素，这种可信度与忠实性不匹配带来技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT能够有效识别模型解释的忠实性问题，为模型可信度评估提供了自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiDe框架，通过Token-wise Attention Decoupling和Layout-Preserving Decoupling解决高分辨率图像中复杂背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升MLLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在高分辨率图像上表现不佳，传统观点认为是感知限制导致小物体识别困难，但本文发现主要问题是复杂背景干扰而非物体大小。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1) Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token并识别关键信息token；2) Layout-Preserving Decoupling从背景中解耦目标区域并重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到SOTA，将Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别提升至92.1%和91.6%，内存使用比之前无训练方法减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe框架有效解决了高分辨率图像中的背景干扰问题，无需训练即可显著提升MLLM性能，证明了背景干扰是影响性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过融合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节处理能力，特别针对灰度变化引起的语义边缘模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中因灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，充分利用空间信息提升分割精度。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解特征为高低频分量来优化边界分割。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同，显著提升了边界区域和灰度过渡区的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1框架将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务建模为下一个路径点预测，通过单次生成范式实现端到端轨迹预测，在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考自动驾驶问题，将其视为序列生成任务，利用VLM的生成能力直接从摄像头输入预测轨迹，避免复杂的多阶段处理流程。

Method: 提出单次生成范式，基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略，实现端到端的轨迹预测。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比先前基线整体提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力和跨车辆鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础，展示了端到端方法在复杂驾驶场景中的潜力和适应性。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端的CNN压缩设计空间探索框架，通过基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略和一次性微调过程，显著降低压缩时间和计算成本，同时兼容多种层类型和分解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解方法面临秩选择困难、设计空间大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等问题，需要更高效的压缩框架。

Method: 基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，一次性微调过程，集成6种不同的低秩分解技术（卷积层3种，全连接层3种），在TensorFlow 2.x中实现。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著压缩且精度损失最小，优于多种先进技术。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了低秩分解的关键挑战，通过组合多种分解方法实现了更好的压缩效果，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在准确解释复杂的视觉-文本关系方面仍存在困难，多智能体标注系统具有作为高质量图像描述生成器和未来数据集构建工具的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于无偏平滑神经元(USN)度量的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN神经元并保留高USN神经元来减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，在亮度对比度扰动下实现更好的鲁棒性认证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉和机器人应用中广泛使用，需要验证其对语义变换扰动(如亮度和对比度)的鲁棒性。当前认证训练和鲁棒性认证方法面临过参数化挑战，阻碍了紧密度和可扩展性。

Method: 首先分析层和神经元对输入扰动的稳定性和方差，提出USN度量来指示可认证鲁棒性。基于USN设计剪枝方法，移除低USN神经元并保留高USN神经元。进一步提出Wasserstein距离损失来确保剪枝神经元在层间更集中。

Conclusion: 提出的USN剪枝方法有效解决了过参数化问题，在保持模型表达能力的同时显著提升了鲁棒性认证的紧密度和效率。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于传输理论的高光谱异常检测新方法，通过将像素视为模板模式的变形观测，在SCDT域中构建背景信号模型，从而检测异常信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱异常检测在民用和军事应用中很重要，但由于复杂环境和先验知识有限，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 使用传输理论模型描述高光谱像素，将其视为模板模式的变形观测，在SCDT域中应用无监督子空间建模技术构建背景信号模型。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于传输理论的HAD方法能有效检测高光谱图像中的异常像素，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发了对检测合成图像和溯源的需求。现有水印方法对真实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且更新成本高。

Method: 将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥相关扰动，提出MOLM框架，使用二进制密钥激活残差块和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，对失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和黑盒对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性，无需密钥特定的重新训练，为生成图像溯源提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界目标检测方法存在已知与未知类别间的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知类别召回率低和已知类别准确率下降。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数挖掘代表性未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标解耦已知与未知表示并保持已知类别的判别一致性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别将已知类别准确率提高了2.83%和2.05%，未知类别召回率比领先基线提高了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式数据发现和表示学习有效解决了开放世界目标检测中的语义混淆和遗忘问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Conclusion: 通过离散小波变换增强VAE潜在空间表示的方法在卫星图像处理中表现出色，为遥感应用中的潜在扩散模型提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将历史特征注入预测解码器。

Result: 在EgoTraj-Bench基准上达到最先进性能，平均减少minADE和minFDE 10-15%，表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正适应真实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法在映射噪声图像时存在两个问题：高频结构细节保留不足，以及在拟合高频时学习到高频噪声

Method: 1. 频率带选择策略加速训练收敛；2. 使用Lipschitz常数限制卷积核学习高频噪声的能力；3. 频谱分离和低秩重建模块(SSR)通过频域分离和低秩空间重建分离噪声与高频细节

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了SCNet的有效性

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制优化自监督去噪，能够更好地保留图像高频结构细节并避免学习高频噪声

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent

TL;DR: MathSticks是一个用于视觉符号组合推理的基准测试，通过移动火柴棒来修正错误算式，统一了视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在视觉符号组合推理方面存在显著局限，需要建立严格的测试基准来评估和推进该领域的发展。

Method: 构建包含140万生成实例和精选测试集的基准，涵盖文本引导和纯视觉设置，系统化考虑数字规模、移动复杂度、解决方案多样性和运算符变化。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型显示：闭源模型仅能处理简单情况，开源模型在视觉场景中失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进视觉和符号的组合推理提供了严格的测试平台，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are
publicly available at https://github.com/Yuheng2000/MathSticks.

*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用正常和异常样本作为参考的通用异常检测方法NAGL，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨域异常检测，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用异常检测方法主要只使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了现实场景中可获得的异常样本所包含的宝贵信息。

Method: 提出NAGL框架，包含残差挖掘(RM)和异常特征学习(AFL)两个关键组件。RM从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，AFL通过残差映射自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的通用异常检测方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，有效利用两种参考样本实现更准确高效的跨域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RAF特征提取技术，通过融合图像的相对特征和数值的绝对特征来改进基于图像的方法选择，在稀疏线性系统求解中比传统方法快5.86%-11.50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像的方法选择技术存在特征提取问题，可能将不同矩阵编码为相同的图像表示，导致选择相同的方法和次优结果。

Method: RAF特征提取技术，同时提取并融合图像的相对特征和对应数值的绝对特征，实现全面的矩阵表示，避免特征模糊性。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的评估显示，求解时间减少0.08s-0.29s，比传统基于图像的方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过融合相对和绝对特征，提高了基于图像方法选择的准确性，解锁了这类方法的潜力。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于affordance感知文本描述的生成式手部姿态优化方法，通过扩散模型学习手部姿态分布，利用大视觉语言模型推断手物交互描述来指导被遮挡区域的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部严重自遮挡或被物体遮挡时的3D手部姿态重建问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如affordance）解决模糊性的启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型学习基于affordance描述的手部姿态分布，affordance描述由大视觉语言模型推断，用于指导被遮挡区域的姿态优化。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的扩散优化方法显著提升了手部姿态估计精度。

Conclusion: affordance引导的优化能够显著改善严重遮挡情况下的手部姿态估计，生成更准确和功能连贯的手部姿态。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽视了压缩带来的特征空间扰动导致的训练困难

Method: 通过token一致性和layer一致性蒸馏，在token维度和层维度分解特征空间扰动，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难，提升了多模态大模型的效率

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个用于评估超声心动图基础模型的标准化基准，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归任务和5个分类任务，为超声心动图领域提供了可复现的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型应用受限，缺乏标准化评估基准。现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，难以比较。超声心动图面临噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 不同模型家族具有互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学意义轴。通用编码器迁移能力强但难以处理细粒度区分。

Conclusion: CardioBench建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供实用指导，通过发布预处理、分割和公开评估流程促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从粗到精的级联扩散框架，结合概率建模与级联细化，用于3D手部姿态重建，解决了姿态模糊性和不确定性建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节带来的姿态模糊性；级联方法缺乏不确定性建模能力；概率方法局限于单阶段估计且缺乏细化能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型采样多样的3D关节假设；第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型（Mesh LDM）基于关节样本重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了概率建模和级联细化的优势，解决了3D手部姿态重建中的模糊性和不确定性挑战。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感图像中害虫检测的挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了在微生物学图像分析中，使用数据高效的基础模型可以大幅减少标注数据需求，MaskDINO仅用150张图像就能达到与大量标注训练的YoloV9相近的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量手动标注数据，过程劳动密集且耗时，作者希望证明在解决新视觉任务时，详尽标注不再是必要条件。

Method: 构建了5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集和少样本场景，对比了三种视觉基础模型与传统基线在任务特定指标上的表现。

Result: MaskDINO仅用150张图像微调就能达到与大量训练的YoloV9相近性能，仅用25张图像仍能保持竞争力，在约70%样本上保持可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够以传统方法所需数据的一小部分实现相当性能，使自动化微生物系统能够更早开发并更快迭代改进，且具有比传统模型更优的上限性能。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务到多任务学习过渡时存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 在LoRA-based MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家通过路由器计算的门控权重联合归一化；增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，ASE在不同配置下均能持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中的知识共享和专家协作问题，提升了多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法被限制为合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或总序列时长的灵活性。

Method: 提出了Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)来支持任意时间戳插值，并将长序列生成分解为分段帧合成，采用外观-运动解耦条件策略确保跨段时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp框架成功实现了任意时间戳和任意长度的视频帧插值，为视频生成应用提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF风格迁移方法通常只是将风格统计信息集成到原始NeRF管道中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，通过多级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图。

Result: 大量实验证明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现出色，能够保持多尺度空间结构同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过重新设计NeRF管道和引入创新模块，显著提升了3D风格迁移的性能，并支持使用3D风格参考的全视角风格迁移。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施安全检测中手动标注成本高、效率低的问题，实现自动化缺陷标注。

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用优化领域特定提示和递归验证过程，通过迭代自问机制进行精炼。

Result: 在区分缺陷与非缺陷图像上达到98%准确率，在四类缺陷标注中达到85%-98%准确率（类别平衡），在类别不平衡数据集上达到80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT为高保真数据集构建提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced

TL;DR: 提出COFA策略，通过前景-背景特征增强来提升视觉语言导航的泛化能力，在REVERIE和R2R数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中前景和背景的重要性未被充分探索，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息

Method: 使用语义增强地标识别分离前景和背景特征，然后通过共识驱动的在线增强策略整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上提升了基线模型的泛化能力并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景-背景特征增强能有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR提出了一种同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的视觉识别方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分来解耦目标中心建模和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了模型在真实部署环境中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来解决问题，但这牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦目标中心建模和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。该方法不需要微调即可提升性能。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在具有域内和域外背景数据集上的性能，证实了即使在复杂场景（如ImageNet-1k）中也能实现定位先于识别。

Conclusion: RCOR是首个在不牺牲任何一方的情况下同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知的方法，为视觉识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN训练在实践中难以正确收敛且存在模式崩溃问题，研究发现条件判别器中的冗余捷径阻碍了有意义的特征提取。

Method: 提出无条件判别器(UCD)，移除判别器中的条件注入，使其提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，性能显著提升且效率高。

Conclusion: 无条件判别器能够促进GAN训练中的纳什均衡，与经典GAN理论兼容，可作为即插即用模块实现显著性能改进。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合几何先验和网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux为评估整流流变换器中概念擦除策略的鲁棒性建立了可靠基准，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下具有优越性和潜力，能够获得高精度的像素级云掩码。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Result: AYT方法能显著加速CM训练，甚至超越LPIPS指标，并且能在极小的批量大小下训练而不影响样本质量。

Conclusion: 通过解决CM切线的振荡问题，AYT方法有效改善了一致性模型的训练效率和样本质量。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Conclusion: U2-rPCA方法在保持数学可解释性的同时，无需学习标签，在超声微血管成像中实现了优异的杂波滤波性能。

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有生成AI方法往往忽视图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，且将潜在空间的概率分布视为不重要或预定义的。本文旨在统一几何和概率视角。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影，构建了确定性模型MPPM，可在表示空间和潜在空间操作。

Conclusion: 通过统一几何和概率视角，提出的框架不仅解释了扩散模型，还构建了性能更优的新模型，为生成AI提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件-图像知识蒸馏的开放词汇目标检测框架，利用CLIP的语义理解能力，通过空间注意力蒸馏和混合SNN-CNN架构，在事件数据上实现开放词汇目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机缺乏纹理和颜色信息，使得开放词汇检测特别困难。现有事件检测方法通常只能识别预定义类别，无法泛化到新物体。虽然视觉语言模型在RGB图像上实现了开放词汇检测，但由于模态差异，无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的丰富视觉表示。设计了混合SNN-CNN框架，SNN自适应确定最佳事件分割时刻，CNN处理提取的事件特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，避免了固定分组事件分割方法造成的关键时间信息丢失问题。

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架成功弥合了事件数据与图像之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据上的开放词汇目标检测，解决了传统方法无法泛化到新物体的问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

*Steffen Meinert,Philipp Schlinge,Nils Strodthoff,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProtoMask模型，使用图像分割基础模型改进原型映射的真实性，通过将显著性图计算限制在预定义的语义图像块来减少可视化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型推理的XAI方法依赖后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑，需要提高嵌入空间到输入空间映射的真实性。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，通过边界框裁剪图像，每个掩码作为独立输入构建ProtoMask模型架构，限制显著性图计算到特定语义区域。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，模型具有竞争性性能，并在可解释性特征方面提供独特优势。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合分割基础模型，有效提高了原型映射的真实性，为可解释AI提供了更可靠的可视化方法。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个推理驱动的框架，通过图变换器和混合专家模块增强概念瓶颈模型，在多模态输入中建模概念间的结构化关系，显著提升了复杂概念推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，且忽略了概念间的结构化关系，无法满足高风险领域对深度学习可解释性日益增长的需求。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模多模态输入中的概念关系；集成图变换器捕获多层次依赖；用混合专家模块替换前馈层，动态分配推理任务给不同子专家。

Result: MoE-SGT在多个数据集上比其他概念瓶颈网络实现了更高的准确率，通过建模概念间的结构化关系和使用动态专家选择机制提升了性能。

Conclusion: MoE-SGT框架通过结合图变换器和混合专家模块，有效克服了传统概念瓶颈模型在建模概念交互和适应复杂概念模式方面的局限性，显著提升了概念推理能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MLLM内在不确定性的训练免费框架，通过响应不确定性评分候选视觉输入，使模型能自主聚焦于最显著的数据，在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位任务中达到与专业微调方法相竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，现有方法依赖复杂、任务特定的微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为主动指导信号，通过模型输出熵的变化来评估视觉信息的相关性，构建统一的机制对候选视觉输入进行不确定性评分。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务中，现成的MLLM能够达到与专门微调方法相竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强多模态细粒度性能的强大通用策略，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督深度学习的运动校正管道，用于心脏磁共振灌注成像，相比传统配准方法处理速度提升15倍，并改善了时间对齐和灌注图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配准方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习替代迭代配准，通过三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，对齐灌注序列和辅助图像。

Result: 深度学习方法显著改善时间强度曲线平滑度，心肌对齐与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图运动减少，处理时间减少15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道实现了快速、鲁棒的运动校正，提高了动态和辅助图像的准确性，在多厂商数据上训练具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

*Divy Kala,Eshika Khandelwal,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ADQA评估基准，用于在几分钟长的连贯视频片段上评估音频描述的质量，发现现有自动生成方法远不如人工撰写，并量化了音频描述的主观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述生成工作主要关注几秒钟的剪辑片段，且通过与单一参考AD比较来评估，但撰写AD本质上是主观的。需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立AD轨道来量化主观性，提出ADQA基准，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解两类问题，在几分钟长的连贯视频片段上评估AD质量。

Result: 量化了音频描述在何时描述、描述什么以及如何强调等方面的主观性；通过ADQA显示当前AD生成方法远落后于人工撰写的AD。

Conclusion: 提出了ADQA基准和公共排行榜，为未来工作提供建议，强调需要在更长、更连贯的视频片段上评估音频描述质量。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

TL;DR: 该研究探索使用少量EEG通道进行情绪预测，通过连续小波变换将脑电信号转换为尺度图，使用视觉变换器模型在仅12个通道的情况下实现了91.57%的情绪分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪评估方法（如自我报告和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性问题，而完整EEG测量成本高且复杂。研究旨在验证低成本、简化EEG设备能否实现足够准确的情绪预测。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集中的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器模型进行情绪分类，重点关注减少输入通道数量。

Result: 模型在仅使用12个测量点（通道）的情况下，对4个情绪象限（高/低唤醒度和效价）的分类准确率达到91.57%，相比使用32个通道的最先进方法96.9%的准确率，仅略有下降。

Conclusion: 显著减少EEG输入通道数量仍能获得高准确度的情绪预测结果，这为低成本EEG设备在情绪识别应用中的可行性提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成式世界模型是否能替代传统视觉编码器范式，用于通用多模态理解任务，特别是研究世界模型先验转移到视觉语言模型中的能力。

Method: 将视频扩散模型重新用作生成编码器，执行单步去噪过程，将得到的潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，构建名为Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA)的最佳变体。

Result: WorldLMs能够捕获对下游理解任务有用的潜在表示，显著增强空间推理能力，使单图像模型能够进行多帧推理，在视觉推理任务中超越开源和专有基线。

Conclusion: WorldLMs通过继承视频预训练中的运动一致性内部化获得性能提升，为利用世界模型先验的新一代视觉语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决极端盲图像恢复(EBIR)问题的新框架，通过将极低质量(ELQ)到高质量(HQ)的恢复过程分解为两个步骤：首先将ELQ图像映射到中间低质量(LQ)流形，然后使用现成的BIR模型恢复为HQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的盲图像恢复方法在面对极端盲图像恢复(EBIR)时表现不佳，因为输入图像遭受严重复合退化，超出了训练范围。直接从极低质量(ELQ)到高质量(HQ)的映射由于巨大的域差距而具有挑战性，往往导致不自然的伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 提出分解恢复过程：1) 学习一个投影器将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形；2) 使用冻结的现成BIR模型将中间图像恢复为HQ。基于信息论视角，将图像恢复视为信息瓶颈问题，推导出理论驱动的目标函数来训练投影器。

Result: 在严重退化机制下的广泛实验提供了对方法有效性的全面分析。

Conclusion: 该框架支持推理时提示精炼的Look Forward Once(LFO)，并支持即插即用地增强现有图像恢复模型，无需微调。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

Conclusion: 该系统实现了更高效、可靠和自动化的质量控制，为陶瓷制造中的无损检测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

TL;DR: 提出了Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD)框架，直接在one-hot空间中保持扩散核心特性，通过协调机制避免了传统伪离散扩散方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义伪离散扩散方法，直接在one-hot空间中保持扩散特性，避免在连续潜在空间扩散或依赖掩码策略。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出和原始one-hot标签之间建立桥梁。

Result: 在分类任务上表现优于基线，在图像描述任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力，各组件通过广泛消融实验验证了可衡量的增益。

Conclusion: ADD框架成功地在one-hot空间中实现了真正的离散扩散，建立了判别式学习和生成式学习之间的协同桥梁。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像-文本对齐评估方法缺乏全面基准，且现有预测器在人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性方面存在不足。

Method: 使用预训练的大型视觉语言模型，在其隐藏状态上训练轻量级岭回归层，构建多目标评分预测器，支持细粒度多目标评分和单一总体评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在7-8B参数规模下性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o基预测器相当，在多目标基准和新数据集EYE4ALL上优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP为解决图像-文本对齐评估中的关键挑战提供了有效方案，新数据集为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础，特别是考虑了盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型难以制作需要学科知识、精确视觉结构和连贯过渡的专业教育视频，而通过可渲染环境和逻辑命令（如代码）的操控能更好地满足这些需求。

Method: 框架包含三个协作智能体：Planner（规划内容流程和视觉资源）、Coder（将指令转换为可执行代码并自动修复）、Critic（使用视觉语言模型优化空间布局和清晰度）。

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了一种可扩展、可解释且可控的教育视频生成方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用深度神经网络的特征表示来生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这在现实场景中应用受限

Method: 使用DNN获取的特征图添加到干净图像中，以破坏目标模型的分类性能，实现单次查询攻击

Result: ZQBA能够将对抗样本迁移到不同模型和数据集（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet），在单次查询下比现有方法更有效，同时保持扰动不可感知

Conclusion: ZQBA方法突显了在现实世界应用DNN的脆弱性，提供了一种高效的黑盒攻击方案

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

*Haifei Zhang,Patrick Barry,Eduardo Brandao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于概念瓶颈模型第二阶段的新型不确定性感知可解释分类器，通过学习二元类级概念原型，利用概念向量与原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念瓶颈模型虽然提供语义上有意义的可解释分类流程，但预测性能通常低于端到端卷积神经网络，且从概念预测到最终标签决策的不确定性传播研究不足。

Method: 学习一组二元类级概念原型，使用预测概念向量与每个类原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量，这些原型也作为可解释的分类规则。

Result: 该框架通过基于学习到的二元类级概念原型的偏差，为不确定或异常输入启用符合性预测，从而增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在概念瓶颈模型的第二阶段实现了不确定性感知和可解释性，通过原型距离提供分类决策和不确定性量化，同时支持对异常输入的符合性预测。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MetaLogic评估框架，通过生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的对齐失败问题，无需真实图像作为基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在输入提示词发生微小语言变化时，难以保持语义一致性，暴露了模型在推理和泛化方面的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语法不同但语义相同的提示词对，直接比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性，分类对齐错误类型（如实体遗漏、重复、位置错位等）。

Result: 在多个最先进的T2I模型上评估显示，Flux.dev和DALLE-3分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，MetaLogic能有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需基准的评估方法，能够有效诊断T2I模型在逻辑理解方面的鲁棒性问题，为模型调试和改进提供反例。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and

through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic

TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的短语定位研究主要局限于单视图图像，忽略了立体视觉中丰富的几何线索，需要将短语定位扩展到立体视觉领域。

Method: 基于PhraseCut数据集，利用GenStereo生成准确的右视图图像，构建包含对齐分割掩码和短语标注的立体图像对数据集。

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集为开发能够联合推理语义和几何的模型提供了基础，将推动多模态学习在立体视觉领域的发展。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM提出了一种基于视觉自回归模型的实时图像超分辨率框架，通过两阶段训练实现高效且鲁棒的超分辨率重建，在保持快速推理的同时显著提升输出质量和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Real-ISR方法存在效率与质量权衡问题：基于扩散模型的方法要么速度慢，要么输出质量低，且对输入图像质量变化敏感。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端全模型微调，基于视觉自回归模型的next-scale预测策略。

Result: NSARM在定量和定性评估中均优于现有Real-ISR方法，在保持快速推理的同时实现更优的视觉效果，对输入图像质量变化具有更高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在Real-ISR任务中实现了质量与效率的良好平衡，展现出更强的泛化性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次类别间的内在关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号。

Method: 第一种方法利用高斯混合模型（G-HMLC），第二种方法使用注意力机制捕捉层次特定特征（A-HMLC），模仿人类处理方式。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，在线性评估中实现了最先进性能，比现有分层对比学习方法准确率提高2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模类间关系和类别不平衡，在所有层次级别实现细粒度聚类，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出GSMamba，一种结合Mamba选择性状态空间模型和移位窗口自注意力的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率，通过Gather-Scatter机制解决遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN方法存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer在长序列上存在二次复杂度限制。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的替代方案，但缺乏空间上下文聚合能力。

Method: 结合移位窗口自注意力进行空间上下文聚合和Mamba选择性扫描进行高效时间传播，引入Gather-Scatter Mamba机制在Mamba传播前后对特征进行对齐和重分布。

Result: 提出的GSMamba架构有效解决了遮挡伪影，确保了聚合信息在所有帧间的有效重分布。

Conclusion: 混合架构结合了Mamba的高效时间建模和自注意力的空间上下文聚合优势，为视频超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为AI-CNet3D的新型混合深度学习模型，通过将交叉注意力机制集成到3D CNN中，从OCT体积中提取关键特征，提高青光眼分类性能，同时减少参数数量并保持高诊断性能。

Motivation: 传统将3D OCT体积压缩为2D报告的做法会导致关键结构细节丢失，需要一种能够保留3D结构信息并提高青光眼诊断准确性的方法。

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型通过解剖学信息交叉注意力网络有效提高了青光眼分类性能，同时增强了可解释性和解剖学一致性，为3D OCT数据分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像迁移学习中的源数据集选择往往依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化能力和患者治疗效果，因此需要系统研究这些决策过程。

Method: 采用以人为中心的HCI视角，通过任务型调查与机器学习从业者进行访谈，分析他们选择源数据集的决策过程。

Result: 研究发现源数据集选择具有任务依赖性，受社区实践、数据集属性、计算相似性（数据嵌入）以及感知的视觉或语义相似性影响。相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致，参与者常使用模糊术语。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和HCI工具来明确这些启发式方法，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供实用见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤、初始标志点近似，以及通过注意力机制增强的基于补丁的点式CNN。

Result: 在214个健康成人标注扫描上，平均定位误差为3.686mm，解剖距离平均误差为2.822mm，与观察者内变异性相当；在FaceScape数据集的700个受试者上，点误差为0.41mm，距离误差为0.38mm。

Conclusion: PAL-Net在数据集和面部区域间具有良好泛化能力，在点式和结构评估中优于现有方法，为高通量3D人体测量分析提供了轻量级、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了InfVSR方法，将视频超分辨率重新定义为自回归一步扩散范式，解决了长视频处理中的效率和可扩展性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个挑战：(1) 全序列多步去噪导致效率低下；(2) 时间分解导致伪影和不连续性，限制了可扩展性

Method: 1. 将预训练DiT调整为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉指导保持局部和全局一致性；2. 通过补丁级像素监督和跨块分布匹配，将扩散过程高效蒸馏为单步

Result: 实现了无边界长度视频的高效可扩展超分辨率，在新建的长视频基准上达到最先进质量，语义一致性增强，相比MGLD-VSR等方法提速高达58倍

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的边界，通过自回归一步扩散范式实现了高效、可扩展的处理，为长序列视频处理提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于标记的文本到图像生成中文本与视觉标记有效融合的挑战，同时保持任务无关的主干网络。

Method: 使用联合嵌入预测Transformer编码图像和文本为离散标记，在特征预测器后加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，并在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于标记的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与主干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的映射图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的地图构建时间。本研究旨在探索能否在保持竞争力的精度下实现更快的定位速度。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中的特征集合，利用这些映射特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。结合图像检索技术实现快速定位。

Result: FastForward在最小地图准备时间下实现了最先进的精度，并展现出对未见领域（包括大规模室外环境）的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在单次前向传播中同时完成地图构建和图像定位的可行性，为实时视觉定位系统提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的精炼模块有效改善了自回归模型在视觉-语言任务中的性能，通过增强空间对应关系建模解决了顺序依赖与空间性质之间的冲突。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法解决自回归图像生成中CFG的指导衰减和过度指导问题，通过不确定性加权扰动和步长归一化提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型中CFG存在的两个关键问题：指导衰减（条件-无条件差距随解码快速消失）和过度指导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）。

Method: SoftCFG：不确定性引导的推理方法，在所有token序列上分布自适应扰动；Step Normalization：限制SoftCFG累积扰动以稳定长序列生成。

Result: 显著提升图像质量，在ImageNet 256上达到自回归模型中最优FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是无需训练、模型无关的方法，可无缝集成到现有AR流程中，有效解决CFG在AR模型中的应用挑战。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM是一个新颖的解释框架，通过将CAM与自然语言结合，为深度视觉模型提供语义丰富的解释。它利用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析来生成描述显著视觉证据的文本，同时保留空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CAM及其变体方法虽然能突出显示驱动预测的空间区域，但缺乏对激活背后属性的语义洞察，限制了在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: TextCAM结合CAM的空间定位能力和视觉语言模型的语义对齐能力，使用CLIP嵌入和线性判别分析获得通道级语义表示，然后与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述。还可将特征通道分组以提供更细粒度的视觉-文本解释。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的理由，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过融合空间定位和语义描述，为深度视觉模型提供了更丰富、更可解释的解释框架，增强了模型的可信度和透明度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大视觉语言模型在视频问答中只能处理50秒左右的视频内容，需要更高效的方法来处理长视频。

Method: 使用混合模糊、加权平均、指数和斜坡池化等方法构建1fps输入源，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B模型进行SFT和DPO训练。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升到0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升到0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升到0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下都保持性能提升，表明在时间证据总结方面具有很强的鲁棒性，在TVQA上的零样本测试也得到类似结果。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor作为评估指标有效，作为奖励模型能显著提升文本到图像模型的生成质量，为模型偏好对齐提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据中对抗噪声和非平滑对抗样本导致的光谱语义信息失真问题，显著提升了高光谱分类模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在安全可逆的人脸匿名化方面取得了突破，解决了现有方法在安全性和可逆性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

Result: 在四个不同基准测试（包括3D物体分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了其优越的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层图表示和关键帧增强，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，实现了更通用的任务无关推理和规划能力。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks --including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval-- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，通过单张全景图像输入生成未来视频帧，并利用演化3D重建为视频生成提供空间引导，显著提升视觉真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类在3D环境中进行心理探索和回放的能力启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索，解决现有方法仅合成视频而缺乏空间一致性的问题。

Method: 首先利用具有细粒度视角控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧，然后通过前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后基于演化3D记忆的几何重投影合成未来帧。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的基准测试中，演化3D记忆显著提高了视觉保真度并保持了空间场景一致性，在环闭合检测和扩展轨迹的空间连贯性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: EvoWorld通过演化3D记忆为视频生成提供显式空间引导，在长时程空间一致世界建模方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

TL;DR: IMAGEdit是一个无需训练的视频多主体编辑框架，能够同时编辑任意数量的视频主体外观，同时保持非目标区域不变，无需微调或重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频编辑方法在多主体编辑时存在的提示侧多模态条件不足和掩码边界纠缠问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 通过提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，利用大模型的理解和生成能力产生多模态信息和掩码运动序列，然后将先验掩码序列输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型来合成编辑后的视频。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit通过强大的泛化能力解决了多主体视频编辑中的关键挑战，显著扩展了视频编辑的应用范围，且无需额外训练即可实现高质量的多主体编辑效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

*Hong kyu Lee,Ruixuan Liu,Li Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为直接令牌优化(DTO)的自包含机器学习遗忘方法，该方法直接优化令牌级目标，无需外部资源，在多个基准数据集上比最新基线方法实现了高达16.8倍的遗忘质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM遗忘方法通常依赖辅助语言模型、保留数据集或商业AI服务，这种依赖外部资源的方法不实用且可能引入额外隐私风险。

Method: 通过识别需要遗忘序列中的目标令牌(用于优化遗忘目标)和非目标令牌(用于保持模型效用)，直接优化令牌级目标，实现自包含的遗忘过程。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，DTO方法比最新基线方法实现了高达16.8倍的遗忘质量提升，同时保持了可比较的模型效用水平。

Conclusion: DTO是一种有效的自包含LLM遗忘方法，无需外部资源即可实现高质量的遗忘，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a
subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with
applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model
correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely
forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall
utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often
utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI
services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However,
dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could
potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct
token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs
that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for
external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of
tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the
remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model
utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the
latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show
that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality
on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a
comparable level of model utility.

Motivation: 程序性活动助手在日常生活和专业场景中具有广泛应用潜力，但针对此类助手的系统开发仍处于探索不足的状态。

Method: TAMA框架使用多媒体返回工具实现交错多模态推理，在无需训练的环境中工作，具有灵活的工具选择能力。

Result: 在ProMQA-Assembly多模态程序性QA数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提升视觉语言模型（特别是GPT-5和MiMo-VL）的性能。消融研究证实了多媒体返回工具和灵活工具选择两个特征的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架和实验结果促进了视频和多模态任务的"图像思维"范式，推动了程序性活动助手的开发。

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of
settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack
furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological
experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored
for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural
activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making
use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental
result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our
approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially
GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support
for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework,
multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our
proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images
paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of
procedural activity assistants.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注简单问题或仅基于网络的查询，缺乏对企业环境中复杂深度研究任务的评估能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的合成流水线生成任务，包含人工验证环节，评估代理在异构搜索空间（包括生产力软件、云文件系统、邮件、聊天记录和开放网络）中检索相关信息的能力。

Result: 发布了涵盖10个领域的15个深度研究任务，评估了多种开源和闭源模型及策略，揭示了它们的优势和不足。

Conclusion: DRBench为推进企业深度研究提供了关键路径，展示了不同AI代理在复杂研究任务中的表现差异。

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex,
open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks
that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on
multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product
roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying
supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base.
Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context,
spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software,
cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are
generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with
human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to
recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent,
well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains,
such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source
models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their
strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep
research. Code is available at https://github.com/ServiceNow/drbench.

Motivation: 随着语言模型的广泛应用，需要更好地将个体用户特征融入模型。研究探索语言模型是否能利用个人信仰系统的某些方面来提高对齐效果。

Method: 开发PrimeX数据集，收集858名美国居民的公开民意调查数据，包含受访者观点解释和Primal World Belief调查评估的世界观信息。

Result: 初步分析显示观点解释和世界观信息对个性化语言模型具有价值，能够提升模型性能。

Conclusion: PrimeX中的额外信仰信息对NLP和心理学研究社区都有益处，为后续研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: As the adoption of language models advances, so does the need to better
represent individual users to the model. Are there aspects of an individual's
belief system that a language model can utilize for improved alignment?
Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion
prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from
858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written
explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the
Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an
extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief
explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results
demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both
the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further
study.

TL;DR: PREFDISCO是一个评估方法，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务，使用心理学基础的人设和稀疏偏好，揭示当前LLM在个性化推理方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM开发将任务解决和偏好对齐视为独立挑战，但在面向人类的应用中，正确解决问题不足够，如果响应与用户需求不匹配。在即时场景中，由于冷启动或隐私限制，缺乏用户交互历史，LLM需要识别未知的用户偏好，通过提问策略性地获取偏好值，然后相应地调整推理过程和响应。

Method: 引入PREFDISCO评估方法，使用心理学基础的人设和稀疏偏好，将静态基准转化为交互式个性化任务。创建相同问题需要不同推理链的场景，根据用户上下文，最优解释方法因个人专业知识和偏好而异，同时保持事实准确性。

Result: 在10个任务上评估21个前沿模型，发现29.0%的朴素个性化尝试产生比通用响应更差的偏好对齐，但通用响应也无法有效服务个体用户需求。

Conclusion: 个性化推理需要专门开发，而不是自然涌现。PREFDISCO将个性化推理确立为可衡量的研究前沿，揭示了当前LLM交互能力的根本局限性，为在教育、医疗和技术领域开发能够适应个体用户的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and
preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective
correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm
fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is
insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge
intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history
exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to
identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit
preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and
responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we
term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology
that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using
psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework
creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains
depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual
expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21
frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts
produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic
responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings
suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than
emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a
measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current
LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems
that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical
domains where personalization is critical.

Motivation: 现有偏见缓解方法使用不同的基线和指标进行评估，导致比较不一致，且大多基于LLM概率的比较，忽略了与现实使用场景的差距。

Method: 构建BiasFreeBench基准，比较8种偏见缓解技术（4种基于提示和4种基于训练的方法），在两种测试场景（多选QA和开放式多轮QA）下评估，并引入Bias-Free Score响应级指标。

Result: 系统比较了提示与训练范式、模型大小以及不同训练策略对未见偏见类型的泛化能力等关键维度的去偏见性能。

Conclusion: 该基准将为偏见缓解研究建立统一的测试平台，促进该领域的一致评估和比较。

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs)
use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to
inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly
based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased
contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use
cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair
and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent
evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce
BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight
mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four
training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended
multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response
setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to
measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and
anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and
analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model
size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types.
We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed
for bias mitigation research.

Motivation: 解决现有自动翻译评估指标缺乏可解释性和透明度的问题，利用大型推理模型的显式推理能力来改进翻译质量评估。

Method: 使用大型推理模型进行系统化、逐步的翻译质量评估，采用结构化提示模板，并评估不同推理深度对评估质量的影响。

Result: 在WMT24评测中，TASER在系统级评估中获得了基于参考和无参考设置下的最高软配对准确率，在段落级评估中无参考变体在所有无参考方法中排名第一。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在翻译质量评估方面显示出可衡量的进步，结合了改进的准确性和跨不同语言对的透明评估。

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and
Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated
translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning
capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of
translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across
both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the
highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free
settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER
maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as
the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments
reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs
compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs.
We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning
efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and
evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers
interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing
automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a

Motivation: 当前缺乏针对心电图文语言模型的RAG开源实现和系统研究，而RAG技术能有效减少幻觉并改善自然语言生成质量。

Method: 开发了首个开源的心电图文语言模型RAG管道，包含基线模型和消融研究，在三个公共数据集上进行实验验证。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了心电图文语言模型RAG技术的空白，为后续研究提供了开源工具和设计指导。

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing,
as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual
queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs
are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis,
diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions,
dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language
Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce
hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite
its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline
design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first
open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies
for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG
consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM
design considerations. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前LLM自动评分器存在根本问题：它们基于离散偏好标签训练，将主观、模糊或细微的任务强制简化为单一标准答案，限制了可靠性。

Method: 提出了一个通用框架，包含两种学习方法：1）针对密集概率标签的直接监督微调；2）针对稀疏二元标签的强化学习方法。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用分布匹配目标微调的自动评分器能够生成与目标偏好分布更一致的概率预测，具有更好的校准性和显著降低的位置偏差，同时在客观任务上保持性能。

Conclusion: 通过建模完整偏好分布而非单一标准答案，可以显著提高LLM自动评分器的可靠性和校准性。

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly
relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However,
their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on
discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are
often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater
must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target
population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating
probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the
problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions:
1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a
reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical
results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective
leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the
target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly
lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本生成任务中表现出色，但在文本分类任务中潜力未充分挖掘，特别是在需要细微分类的文本修订任务中。由于修订标注数据昂贵且稀缺，需要开发参数高效的微调方法。

Method: 提出IR-Tuning框架，基于梯度范数分布动态选择重要的LLM层进行微调，同时冻结冗余层，实现参数高效的层级微调。

Result: 实验表明IR-Tuning在多种文本修订任务上优于其他层级PEFT基线方法，具有快速收敛、低GPU内存消耗和小规模修订语料上的有效性。

Conclusion: IR-Tuning为LLM在文本分类任务中的参数高效微调提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于标注数据稀缺的复杂分类场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various
text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text
classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize
generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can
transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to
categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves
nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for
revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision
annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To
address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of
important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm
distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments
suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse
text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption,
and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy
to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction
pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the
document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe
passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document
and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a
three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that
generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a
string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using
these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on
information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of
extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs.
Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on
a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at
flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as
1-2 hours.

TL;DR: 提出一个临床基础的元评估框架，重新思考放射学报告生成评估指标的设计，揭示现有指标在临床语义理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动生成的放射学报告在现有评估指标上得分很高，但无法获得临床医生的信任，这暴露了当前评估指标在评估生成报告质量方面的根本缺陷。

Method: 定义临床基础的标准，包括临床对齐和关键指标能力（区分度、鲁棒性和单调性），使用细粒度标注的数据集系统评估现有指标。

Result: 发现现有指标在解释临床语义方面存在局限性：无法区分临床显著错误、过度惩罚无害变异、在错误严重程度级别上缺乏一致性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更临床可靠的评估方法提供指导。

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from
existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap
reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of
generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and
propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically
grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities,
including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained
dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types,
clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate
existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical
semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors,
over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error
severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically
reliable evaluation methods.

TL;DR: o-mega是一个超参数优化工具，用于自动识别语义匹配领域中最有效的可解释AI方法及其配置，以提升自动事实核查系统的透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于transformer的语言模型在NLP领域带来了革命性进展，但同时也引入了模型透明度和可信度的重大挑战。研究人员开发了大量解释方法和评估指标，使得选择最佳可解释性方法变得复杂。

Method: 开发了o-mega超参数优化工具，系统探索不同的可解释方法及其超参数。在社交媒体帖子与反驳声明配对的精选数据集上，通过后声明匹配流程进行评估。

Result: 该工具能够自动识别最有效的可解释AI方法配置，在自动事实核查系统中展示了改进的透明度。

Conclusion: 这种解释方法的自动优化可以显著增强关键应用（如错误信息检测）中声明匹配模型的可解释性，有助于构建更可信和透明的AI系统。

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP
domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model
transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable
systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation
methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers. To address the
challenge of selecting optimal explainability approaches, we present
\textbf{\texttt{o-mega}}, a hyperparameter optimization tool designed to
automatically identify the most effective explainable AI methods and their
configurations within the semantic matching domain. We evaluate o-mega on a
post-claim matching pipeline using a curated dataset of social media posts
paired with refuting claims. Our tool systematically explores different
explainable methods and their hyperparameters, demonstrating improved
transparency in automated fact-checking systems. As a result, such automated
optimization of explanation methods can significantly enhance the
interpretability of claim-matching models in critical applications such as
misinformation detection, contributing to more trustworthy and transparent AI
systems.

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个用于安全运营中心告警分诊的多智能体LLM架构，通过专业化智能体协作处理告警，显著减少误报并提高调查质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 安全运营中心面临每日数万告警的过载问题，传统检测管道脆弱且缺乏上下文，而现有的单模型LLM方法在处理嘈杂的企业数据时表现不佳且透明度有限。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM架构，包括行为分析智能体检查活动序列、证据收集智能体查询外部系统、推理智能体综合发现生成可审计决策。

Result: 在多样化企业场景中，CORTEX相比最先进的单智能体LLM显著减少了误报并提高了调查质量。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作方法在告警分诊任务中优于单模型方法，提供了更好的性能和透明度。

Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of
daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This
overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst
burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while
recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs,
retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that
struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We
propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in
which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis
agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external
systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision.
To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC
investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst
actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX
substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over
state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

*Zijun Wu,Yongchang Hao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TokMem是一种标记化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑的可训练嵌入，为LLMs提供显式程序记忆，避免重复上下文开销，性能优于检索增强生成和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型严重依赖提示来指定任务、回忆知识和指导推理，但这种依赖效率低下，因为提示必须在每个步骤重新读取，跨任务扩展性差，且缺乏模块化重用机制。

Method: 引入TokMem，一种标记化程序记忆，将重复程序存储为紧凑的可训练嵌入。每个记忆标记编码程序地址和控制信号，在保持骨干模型冻结的情况下支持持续适应。

Result: 在1000个原子回忆任务和函数调用组合回忆任务上，TokMem始终优于检索增强生成，同时避免重复上下文开销，且参数远少于微调方法。

Conclusion: TokMem为LLMs提供了可扩展和模块化的程序记忆替代方案，相比提示工程和微调具有明显优势。

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall
knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts
must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms
for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that
stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token
encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers
generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support
continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new
procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate
TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for
compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented
generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far
fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular
alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit
procedural memory for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongCodeZip是一个专为代码LLM设计的即插即用压缩框架，通过双阶段压缩策略在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文剪枝技术如LLMLingua在通用文本上表现良好，但忽略了代码特定的结构和依赖关系，导致在编程任务中性能不佳。高API成本和生成延迟是代码LLM处理长上下文的主要瓶颈。

Method: 采用双阶段压缩策略：1）粗粒度压缩，基于条件困惑度识别和排序函数级块，保留最相关函数；2）细粒度压缩，将保留函数按困惑度分割成块，在自适应token预算下选择最优子集以最大化相关性。

Result: 在代码补全、总结和问答等多个任务上的评估显示，LongCodeZip始终优于基线方法，在保持任务性能的同时实现高达5.6倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: LongCodeZip通过有效减小上下文大小同时保留关键信息，使LLM能够更好地扩展到现实世界的大规模代码场景，提升了代码智能应用的效率和能力。

Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as
Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information
in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs,
high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing
context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for
general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to
suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose
LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed
specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1)
coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks
using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only
the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments
retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal
subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across
multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question
answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods,
achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By
effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information,
LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code
scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注分类或排序任务，而评分预测这一需要语言和数学推理的回归任务在工业应用中很重要，但现成大语言模型在此任务上的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过在三个数据集上对八个模型进行综合实验，提供不同的上下文信息，包括用户评论和一般偏好描述，并尝试让模型首先生成假设性评论。

Result: 用户撰写的评论显著提高了LLMs的评分预测性能，性能与矩阵分解等传统方法相当；基于具体物品的评论比一般偏好描述更有效；让LLMs首先生成假设性评论能进一步提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 现成大语言模型在评分预测任务中表现出色，用户评论是关键因素，为解决冷启动问题提供了有前景的解决方案，展示了LLMs在个性化推荐系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with
individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous
studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not
considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both
language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has
significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains
underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs.
This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating
prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive
experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that
user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of
LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix
factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for
the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are
more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any
specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a
hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is
available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型代理方法主要依赖上下文学习的少样本提示，这会导致输入冗长和计算成本高。代理微调虽然能通过训练让模型内化程序推理和领域知识，但在专业技术微领域中的有效性尚不明确。

Method: 使用JP1特定数据集（来自领域手册和模型自生成的推理轨迹）对大语言模型进行微调，在推理时采用检索增强生成和上下文-答案提取器来提高信息相关性。

Result: 在JP1认证考试问题上，该方法相比基础模型实现了14%的性能提升，显著提高了决策准确性和搜索效率。

Conclusion: 代理微调在复杂微领域中具有显著潜力，能够有效提升领域特定推理能力，为专业技术领域的自动化运维提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously
interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning
tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with
few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher
computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs
to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through
training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies
have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical
microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain
adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT
operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain
manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves,
enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we
used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a
context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification
exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base
model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific
reasoning in complex microdomains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态代理在复杂或领域外任务中可靠性有限，需要探究它们是否存在伪推理问题。

Method: 使用视觉引导、文本引导和结构引导三种正交探测范式，在不访问模型内部的情况下量化记忆和推理的贡献。

Result: 在5个公开GUI基准测试中，18个多模态代理的结果显示机械记忆通常优于系统性推理，模型主要作为训练对齐知识的检索器，泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 多模态代理在现实场景中需要更强大的推理建模，为开发可靠的多模态代理提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the
autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user
interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or
out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing
multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory
and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations.
Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided,
text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions
of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In
five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the
results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic
reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of
training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings
underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in
real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of
reliable multimodal agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统级联语音系统丢弃副语言线索且限制表达性，现有端到端方法仍依赖文本中间体形成瓶颈，需要实现真正的语音到语音直接交互。

Method: 采用模态分层架构和冻结预训练策略，在预训练文本LLM基础上添加原生语音能力，无需文本指导直接处理语音。

Result: 在口语问答任务中达到最先进水平，语音到语音性能与现有文本引导系统相当，同时保持竞争力的文本性能。

Conclusion: 通过缩小文本引导与直接语音生成之间的差距，为表达性和高效的端到端语音交互建立了新范式。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,
process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards
paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce
latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,
creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true
speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates
speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based
layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving
the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech
capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results
in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech
performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining
competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and
direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive
and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

TL;DR: Graph2Eval是一个基于知识图谱的框架，能自动生成多模态文档理解和网页交互任务，用于全面评估智能代理的推理、协作和交互能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM合成数据方法主要针对LLM训练和评估设计，无法直接应用于需要工具使用和交互能力的代理任务。静态数据集评估无法充分评估代理在动态环境中的真实能力。

Method: 基于多源外部数据构建知识图谱作为任务空间，通过子图采样、任务模板和元路径将语义关系转化为结构化多模态任务，并采用基于节点可达性、LLM评分和相似性分析的多阶段过滤管道保证任务质量和可执行性。

Result: 构建了Graph2Eval-Bench数据集，包含1,319个任务，涵盖文档理解和网页交互场景。实验表明Graph2Eval能有效生成区分代理和模型性能的任务，揭示不同设置下推理、协作和网页交互能力的差距。

Conclusion: Graph2Eval为代理评估提供了新视角，能够全面评估多类型代理（单代理、多代理、网页代理）的推理、协作和交互能力。

Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and
generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately
assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks.
Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training
and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require
tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored
automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text
or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in
web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a
knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal
document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive
evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities.
In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data
serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured
multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A
multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and
similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of
the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of
multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures
reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the
framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning
document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that
Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model
performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction
across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

TL;DR: CopyPasteLLM通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练，增强LLM对上下文的信任度，显著减少幻觉问题。该方法仅需365个训练样本，在多个基准测试中表现优异，准确率提升12.2%-24.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中LLM可能不信任提供的上下文，导致产生与上下文不符的幻觉，影响可靠性。研究发现响应复制程度与上下文不忠实幻觉呈负相关。

Method: 提出CopyPasteLLM，通过两阶段高复制响应偏好训练获得。设计了三种提示方法来增强复制程度，构建全自动流水线将生成响应转化为高复制偏好数据。

Result: 在FaithEval、ConFiQA和PubMedQA上，CopyPasteLLM在反事实和原始上下文中均表现最佳，FaithEval准确率比最佳基线提升12.2%-24.5%，仅需365个训练样本（基线数据的1/50）。

Conclusion: CopyPasteLLM通过重新校准对内部参数知识的依赖而非外部知识，有效提升上下文忠实度。高复制响应能实现优越的上下文忠实度和幻觉控制。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models
(LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness
remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context,
leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse
correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful
hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce
hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM,
obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design
three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that
high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and
hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that
transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training
CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best
performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2%
to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while
requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate
CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying
Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates
reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during
generation. All codes are available at

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for
complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated
improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We
propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:
a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with
critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,

multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework
consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance
of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of
system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and

Motivation: 现有多语言数据集对大多数语言包含数据不足，导致模型在多数支持语言上表现不佳，需要为每种语言提供充足的训练数据。

Method: 使用包含媒体检索和两阶段对齐算法的可扩展流程处理议会录音，专门设计用于处理非逐字转录和长音频。

Result: 从22个欧洲议会提取了61k+小时对齐语音段，19种语言超过1k小时，22种语言超过500小时高质量语音数据，微调现有ASR模型使词错误率平均降低41.8%。

Conclusion: 该流程成功构建了大规模高质量多语言语音数据集，显著提升了ASR模型在多语言场景下的性能。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality
performance across languages requires substantial training data for each
individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages,
they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models
perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses
this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech
datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust
components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to
handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to
recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned
speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages
exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech
data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines
when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the
usefulness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在大型语言模型的后训练阶段，传统的负对数似然目标并非总是最优选择。通过分析概率基目标族在不同模型能力条件下的表现，揭示了模型能力连续体是决定目标效果的关键维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调是后训练大型语言模型的标准方法，但其泛化能力有限。作者认为这可能源于默认使用的负对数似然目标，该目标在从零开始训练时最优，但在后训练阶段可能违反其最优性假设。

Method: 研究了概率基目标族在不同条件下的有效性，通过7个模型骨干、14个基准测试和3个领域的综合实验和消融研究，分析了模型能力连续体对目标行为的影响。

Result: 发现模型能力连续体是决定目标行为的关键维度：在模型能力强的一端，倾向于先验的目标（如$-p$、$-p^{10}$及其阈值变体）持续优于负对数似然；在模型能力弱的一端，负对数似然占主导；在中间区域，没有单一目标占优。

Conclusion: 理论分析阐明了目标在连续体上的权衡关系，为根据模型能力调整目标提供了原则性基础。研究结果表明需要根据模型能力选择适当的训练目标，而非总是使用负对数似然。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large
language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace
this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood
(NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch,
post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality
assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision
can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of
probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under
different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation
studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a
critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability
continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight
low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants)
consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in
between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further
elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a
principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability. Our code is

*Kung-Hsiang Huang,Haoyi Qiu,Yutong Dai,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI-KV是一种即插即用的KV缓存压缩方法，专门针对GUI代理设计，无需重新训练。它通过空间显著性引导和时间冗余评分技术，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理在处理高分辨率截图和长任务时面临效率挑战，现有缓存压缩方法未能充分利用GUI的空间和时间冗余特性。

Method: 结合两种新技术：空间显著性引导（用隐藏状态的L2范数增强注意力分数）和时间冗余评分（将历史帧的键投影到当前帧的键子空间来优先剪枝冗余历史）。

Result: 在标准GUI代理基准测试中，GUI-KV优于竞争基线，在适度预算下接近全缓存精度。在AgentNetBench上，解码FLOPs减少38.9%，步骤准确率提高4.1%。

Conclusion: 利用GUI特定的冗余特性可以实现高效可靠的代理性能。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have
emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However,
they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of
high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference
slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this,
storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing
cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the
spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze
attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural
images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers.
This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we
show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on
this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI
agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i)
spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of
hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii)
temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the
current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across
standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV
compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets.
Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV
reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the
full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific
redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

*Minjae Oh,Sangjun Song,Seungkyu Lee,Sungmin Jo,Yohan Jo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 小推理模型在工具使用时容易过度思考：它们先达到正确的工具参数配置，然后继续推理并用错误的最终调用覆盖。通过oracle提前终止可以显著提升准确率并减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小推理模型在工具使用中存在过度思考问题，导致正确配置被后续错误推理覆盖，这为提升推理效率和准确性提供了改进空间。

Method: 引入ThinkBrake解码启发式方法，在句子边界监控</think>与当前top token的对数概率边际，当边际变小时触发终止。

Result: 在Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard上，ThinkBrake在保持或提高准确率的同时，减少了高达25%的token使用，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: ThinkBrake提供了一种无需训练的解码策略，有效解决了小推理模型的过度思考问题，在工具使用场景中实现了更好的效率和准确性平衡。

Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a
correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it
with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that
inject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\%
to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable
headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise
reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains
underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and
introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors
the log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at
sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.
Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or
improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了CHIME数据集用于评估大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解能力，发现模型在解释文化背景复杂的流行语和追溯起源方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型是否真正理解在互联网上快速传播的病毒性内容——网络流行语，特别是中文语境下的流行语。

Method: 构建CHIME中文网络流行语解释数据集，包含流行语的含义、起源、例句等信息；设计两个评估任务：流行语解释任务和多选题填空任务。

Result: 模型能够解释部分流行语的含义，但对文化和语言细微差别较大的流行语类型表现显著下降；在追溯流行语起源方面持续困难；多选题任务表现低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 大语言模型对中文网络流行语的理解能力有限，特别是在文化背景复杂的流行语和起源追溯方面，需要进一步研究提升模型的文化理解能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the
Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads
online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset
for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular
phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed
information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To
evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the
first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify
its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that
while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines
significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types.
Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the
memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a
contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct
answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made
CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme
understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ReSeek框架，通过自我纠正机制和密集过程奖励函数训练搜索代理，在复杂推理任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的搜索代理依赖稀疏或基于规则的奖励，容易陷入次优推理路径且无法恢复，需要更有效的自我纠正能力。

Method: 引入自我纠正机制，允许代理通过JUDGE动作动态识别和恢复错误搜索路径；设计密集过程奖励函数，分解为正确性奖励和实用性奖励；创建FictionalHot基准避免数据污染。

Result: 实验表明，使用ReSeek训练的代理在任务成功率和路径忠实度方面显著优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSeek框架通过自我纠正和密集奖励机制有效提升了搜索代理在复杂推理任务中的性能，为解决次优推理路径问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to
perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often
rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to
suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To
address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework
for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction
mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from
erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action,
the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide
this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which
decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a
utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query.
Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets,
we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently
curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and
practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek
significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出了CoT Vectors方法，通过任务向量范式编码多步推理知识，解决了现有CoT方法成本高、效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought提示方法（如上下文学习和微调）成本高昂且效率低下，需要更经济高效的推理增强方案。

Method: 引入CoT Vectors作为紧凑表示，首先提取CoT向量发现层间不稳定性，然后提出可学习CoT向量在师生框架下优化，提供更稳定的指导。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上，CoT Vectors不仅优于现有基线，性能可与参数高效微调方法相媲美，同时需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: CoT Vectors不仅提供了一种高效的推理增强方法，还揭示了LLMs中多步推理的功能组织机制，包括潜在空间结构、信息密度等因素的影响。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain
costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired
by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations
that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments
with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability,
manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic
three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose
Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide
more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse
benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing
baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by
treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due
to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and
pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional
organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Conclusion: 不仅推进了语言分离研究，还为代码切换语音技术建立了基础框架

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural spoken language diarization model that
supports an unconstrained span of languages within a single framework. Our
approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in
multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated
code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and
architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world
multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23%
to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances
research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework
for code-switching speech technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tenyidie是印度那加兰邦的一种低资源藏缅语系语言，具有声调、主宾动语序和高度粘着性特征。由于是低资源语言，自然语言处理研究非常有限，特别是音节划分方面尚无相关研究。

Method: 应用了LSTM、BLSTM、BLSTM+CRF和Encoder-decoder四种深度学习架构，在80:10:10划分的数据集上进行训练、验证和测试。

Result: 在测试集上，BLSTM模型取得了99.21%的最高准确率，表明深度学习模型在Tenyidie语言音节划分任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作为Tenyidie语言创建了首个音节划分数据集，并验证了深度学习方法的有效性，将为该语言的形态分析、词性标注、机器翻译等NLP应用提供重要基础。

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family
spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India
and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal,
Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource
language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been
conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been
reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or
syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are
identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified
Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the
created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and
Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our
dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest
accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its
application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MCM-DPO方法，通过多维度偏好优化改进替代文本生成，无需精确标注即可从偏好对中学习更好的选项选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代文本生成任务存在用户标注噪声、标准不一致以及多模态大语言模型对上下文信息不敏感等问题，传统的监督微调方法依赖准确的目标标注，而用户生成的替代文本标注往往存在缺陷。

Method: 提出多维度跨模态直接偏好优化(MCM-DPO)，在单维度、配对维度和多偏好维度上优化偏好，涵盖文本、视觉和跨模态因素。构建了两个大规模高质量数据集TAlt和PAlt，包含202k标注样本和18k偏好对。

Result: 实验结果表明，MCM-DPO方法在替代文本生成任务中持续优于DPO和SFT方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MCM-DPO通过多维度偏好优化有效解决了替代文本生成中的标注质量问题，为这一领域的研究提供了新的解决方案和数据集支持。

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions
of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite
the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation
performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent
standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts
to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT
relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated
alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct
Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by
learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring
precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and
multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors.
In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled
datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets
named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include
202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse
preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain.
Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently
outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text
generation. We release the code and data here:

Motivation: 手动创建易读文本耗时耗力，需要自动化解决方案来为认知障碍人群提供平等的信息获取机会。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，联合训练文本摘要、文本简化和易读文本生成任务，探索了基于检索增强生成的多任务学习和参数高效的MTL-LoRA微调策略。

Result: 实验表明多任务设置在所有配置中都优于单任务基线，RAG策略在跨域场景中表现良好，MTL-LoRA在域内配置中优于所有学习策略。

Conclusion: 多任务学习框架有效提升了易读文本自动生成的性能，为认知障碍人群的信息获取提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to
information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The
Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible
to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains
time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the
potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR
content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR
constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models
jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We
explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient
fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a
new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over
single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that
the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while
MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Conclusion: 该方法为易读文本生成提供了有效的解决方案，预训练语言模型在性能和适应性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is
essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,
manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to
scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and
civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key
challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing
lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we
introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant
with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on
PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and
accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic
metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a
36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall
results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to
out-of-domain texts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阿拉伯语基准主要关注检索和理解任务，缺乏专门针对多步推理的数据集，特别是在开放式的法律推理领域。

Method: 构建包含案件事实、法庭推理、判决结果和引用条款的数据集，设计判决预测、推理链补全和相关法规识别等任务，并对阿拉伯语LLMs进行基准测试和指令微调。

Result: 指令微调12B参数模型后，在判决预测和阿拉伯语判决生成任务上表现显著提升，达到与GPT-4o相当的水平。

Conclusion: ALARB数据集有效填补了阿拉伯语法律推理基准的空白，证明了指令微调在提升LLMs法律推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal
domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks
such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically
on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are
lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi
Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the
court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory
documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and
reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict
prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and
identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a
representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks
and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show
that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly
enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation,
reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

Motivation: 解决低资源语言法罗语的LLM适配问题，探索从相关语言迁移学习的方法，填补法罗语评估数据的空白。

Method: 从英语模型开始，在相关斯堪的纳维亚语言上继续预训练（单独或合并），然后对法罗语进行微调。比较全微调与LoRA方法，构建新的最小对基准测试集，并辅以法罗语语言学家的专家评估。

Result: 相关语言迁移至关重要，但最佳源语言因任务而异：冰岛语提升语言准确性，丹麦语增强理解能力。LoRA改善语言可接受性，全微调在理解任务上表现更好且能更好保持模型能力。

Conclusion: 法罗语LLM适配需要任务特定的方法：语言准确性和文本理解需要不同的源语言和微调策略，LoRA和全微调各有优势，应根据具体任务需求选择。

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource
North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training
on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging,
before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with
parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both
linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese
evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and
newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese
linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is
crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic
enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly,
the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves
linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the
base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance
and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

Motivation: 解决检索增强LLM机器翻译在真实部署中面临噪声检索环境时的可靠性问题，目前对此缺乏系统理解。

Method: 提出噪声合成框架和新指标，使用Qwen系列模型（包括标准LLM和增强推理的LRM）在不同资源水平的语言对上评估REAL-MT在合成噪声下的表现。

Result: 低资源语言对在噪声下退化更严重，常产生无意义翻译；LRM在错误纠正上无改善，反而更易受噪声影响，倾向于合理化错误上下文；注意力从源习语转向噪声内容，置信度增加但准确性下降。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在局限性，需要在性能和鲁棒性之间权衡，突显了需要自验证集成机制的必要性。

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine
\textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like
idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts
remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world
deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new
metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this
framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard
LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate
their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and
low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that
low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context,
degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce
nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning
capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more
susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that
this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content,
while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor
calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and
fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in
clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the
limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying
integration mechanisms.

TL;DR: ManagerBench是一个评估LLM在管理场景中安全决策能力的基准，测试模型在操作目标与安全价值冲突时的选择倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准主要关注有害内容生成，但忽视了当最有效的操作路径与人类安全冲突时，智能体可能采取有害行动的问题。

Method: 创建包含人类验证的管理场景，每个场景都要求在实用但有害的行动与安全但操作性能较差的行动之间做出选择，并设置平行控制组来测量模型的实用主义倾向。

Result: 前沿LLM在安全与实用权衡方面表现不佳：许多模型为推进操作目标持续选择有害选项，而其他模型则过度安全变得无效。模型的危害评估与人类判断一致，但优先级排序存在缺陷。

Conclusion: ManagerBench是评估智能体行为核心组件的挑战性基准：当操作目标与对齐价值激励冲突行动时做出安全选择的能力。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into
autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical.
Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of
harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of
agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational
goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce
ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic,
human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a
pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe
action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set,
where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's
pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate
that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism
trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their
operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and
ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an
inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human
judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging
benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when
operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了可擦除强化学习(ERL)框架，通过识别、擦除和重新生成错误推理步骤来解决搜索增强LLM在多跳推理中的可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 搜索增强的大型语言模型在复杂多跳推理中可靠性有限，主要面临三个挑战：分解错误、检索缺失和推理错误，任一阶段的失败都会影响最终答案。

Method: ERL框架明确识别错误步骤，擦除这些步骤并在原位置重新生成推理，防止有缺陷的逻辑在推理链中传播。

Result: 使用ERL训练的模型在HotpotQA、MuSiQue、2Wiki和Bamboogle等数据集上取得显著提升，3B模型比之前SOTA提升8.48% EM和11.56% F1，7B模型提升5.38% EM和7.22% F1。

Conclusion: 可擦除强化学习为LLMs中的鲁棒多步推理提供了强大的范式转变。

Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive
capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited.
This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors,
where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence
fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates
through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail
the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel
framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL
explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in
place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain.
This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more
resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial
improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model
achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and
+7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest
that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for
robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HalluGuard是一个4B参数的小型推理模型，专门用于缓解检索增强生成中的幻觉问题，通过分类文档-声明对并提供证据支撑的论证，在保持较小模型规模的同时达到与更大模型相当的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然在NLP任务中表现出色，但容易产生幻觉，限制了在实际应用中的可信度。需要开发专门针对幻觉检测的模型来增强可靠性。

Method: 结合领域无关的合成数据集、合成的基础和幻觉声明，以及使用几率比偏好优化的偏好微调方法，将大模型推理能力蒸馏到小型骨干网络中。

Result: 在RAGTruth子集上达到84.0%的平衡准确率，与MiniCheck(7B)和Granite Guardian 3.3(8B)相当但参数减半；在整个基准测试中达到75.7% BAcc，与GPT-4o(75.9%)相当。

Conclusion: HalluGuard证明了通过精心设计的训练策略，小型模型可以在幻觉检测任务上达到与更大模型相当的性能，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to
hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present
HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating
hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies
document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded
justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic
synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation
and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and
(iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to
distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset
of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy
(BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian
3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full
benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as
GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: Sci-SpanDet是一个用于检测学术文本中AI生成内容的结构感知框架，通过结合分段条件风格建模和多层次对比学习，实现了跨领域的精确跨度级检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在学术写作中的快速应用引发了关于作者身份完整性和学术出版物可靠性的严重担忧，现有检测方法存在忽视细粒度跨度定位、校准能力弱且跨领域泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 结合分段条件风格建模与多层次对比学习，采用BIO-CRF序列标注和基于指针的边界解码，集成置信度校准，以捕捉细微的人机差异并减少主题依赖性。

Result: 在包含10万个标注样本的跨学科数据集上，Sci-SpanDet实现了F1(AI) 80.17、AUROC 92.63和Span-F1 74.36的最先进性能，在对抗性重写下表现出强韧性，并在不同学科和IMRaD章节间保持平衡准确率。

Conclusion: Sci-SpanDet显著超越了现有基线方法，为学术文档中AI生成文本检测提供了有效的解决方案，并将公开发布数据集和源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing
raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of
scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on
document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they
neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often
fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these
limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting
AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned
stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced
human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing
cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling
with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable
precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive
experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000
annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek,
LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows
strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy
across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing
existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on
AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and
source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Motivation: 虽然检索增强生成在各种任务中表现优异，但其在专家级推理（如解决奥林匹克物理问题）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。受学生通过复习过往问题准备比赛的启发，研究者希望探索RAG如何增强基础模型的物理推理能力。

Method: 提出了PhoPile多模态数据集，专门用于奥林匹克级物理问题，包含图表、图形和方程。使用该数据集对RAG增强的基础模型进行基准测试，涵盖大型语言模型和多模态模型，并采用多种检索器。

Result: 结果显示，将检索与物理语料库集成可以提升模型性能，但也揭示了在检索增强物理推理方面仍需进一步研究的挑战。

Conclusion: RAG方法在提升基础模型物理推理能力方面具有潜力，PhoPile数据集为系统研究检索式推理提供了有效工具，但该领域仍存在需要解决的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved
strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level
reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely
unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing
past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning
in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset
specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of
retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations,
capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using
PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large
language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple
retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics
corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that
motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出Fusion-of-N方法，使用LLM法官将多个样本中最具信息量的元素融合成单一最终答案，相比传统的Best-of-N方法在测试时扩展和合成数据生成中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Best-of-N方法本质上是零和游戏，丢弃了候选池中多样且潜在有用的信息。作者希望探索协作设置，让所有候选都能为最终生成做出贡献。

Method: Fusion-of-N方法：使用通用LLM法官来合成每个样本中最具信息量的元素，形成单一最终答案。在两种设置下进行比较：(i)测试时扩展-从单一模型采样并聚合；(ii)合成数据生成-融合来自多样化教师池的样本来改进学生模型。

Result: 在11种语言、3个多样化任务和不同模型规模上的广泛基准测试表明，FusioN始终优于BoN，在测试时扩展和合成数据生成的下游增益方面展现出多功能性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 应该从单一质量度量转向拥抱LLM生成的多面性，通过整合多样化优势、解锁潜在潜力，实现仅通过选择无法达到的改进。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as
a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse
pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently
zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool.
Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially
contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N
(FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most
informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare
FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and
aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation,
where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student
model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse
tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently
outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling
and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform
extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and
robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift
how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic
measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us
to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve
improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

Motivation: 分析LLMs在处理非标准英语方言时性能下降的原因，特别关注语法规则对性能的影响。

Method: 将标准美式英语问题转换为非标准方言变体，在多项选择题回答任务上测试LLM性能，并分析具体语法规则的影响。

Result: 非标准英语问题导致准确率下降高达20%，三个特定语法规则（存在性"it"、零系词和"y'all"）解释了多数性能下降现象。

Conclusion: 呼吁未来研究关注针对个别高影响力语法结构的偏见缓解方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language
processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for
under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying
"standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal
variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%
reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of
under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual
grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more
consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero
copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed
in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation
methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的文本往往过于通用，缺乏结构多样性，限制了个性化表达。扩散模型为超越自回归范式提供了新机会。

Method: 采用级联框架先生成语法引导再进行条件文本生成，并推广到非级联架构以更好对齐结构和内容。通过共享表示机制实现细粒度个性化。

Result: 在多个任务上的实验表明，该方法在流畅性、多样性和风格保真度方面具有优势。定性分析显示了其在学习个性化模式方面的可解释性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 提出的语法引导扩散语言模型通过整合结构监督和个性化条件，显著提升了文本生成的质量、多样性和可控性。

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating
human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting
insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent
advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving
language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this
work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates
structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality,
diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that
generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further
generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between
structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating
process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural
characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained
personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates
information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic
generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on
multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency,
diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its
interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Conclusion: 通过概述最新进展和识别关键挑战，为未来研究提供了路线图，旨在使模型更加透明。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central
goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the
roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as
well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this
challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary,
natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we
provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for
model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating
these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for
evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis
reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the
state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap
for future research toward making models more transparent.

Motivation: 传统基于规则的DST方法在开放域和多轮聊天机器人中效率不足，无法为复杂对话提供足够适应性和连贯性。

Method: 使用BERT进行槽填充和意图检测，XGBoost进行意图验证，GPT进行DST，在线代理进行实时答案生成的混合方法。

Result: 在波斯语聊天机器人中相比现有方法显著提高了准确性和连贯性。

Conclusion: 混合方法能有效提升DST能力，为更定制化、适应性更强、更类人的对话AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI
with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading
it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and
multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,
since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like
experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model
that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for
slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,
and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely
designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset
and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing
methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a
hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational
AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

TL;DR: 本文对非洲低资源语言的自动语音识别(ASR)研究进行了系统性文献综述，分析了数据集、模型、评估方法等现状，发现该领域面临数据稀缺、可复现性差、评估指标单一等问题，并提出了未来发展建议。

Motivation: 尽管ASR技术在全球取得显著进展，但非洲2000多种低资源语言仍被严重忽视，这阻碍了非洲大陆的数字包容性发展。

Method: 采用PRISMA 2020方法，检索了DBLP、ACM Digital Library等数据库2020-2025年的相关研究，筛选出71篇文献进行分析。

Result: 共记录了74个数据集，涵盖111种语言，约11,206小时语音数据。仅不到15%的研究提供可复现材料，数据集许可不明确。自监督和迁移学习有潜力但受限于预训练数据不足。

Conclusion: 非洲语言ASR研究面临数据集可用性、标注质量、许可不确定性等挑战。未来发展需要利益相关者合作、创建伦理平衡的数据集、使用轻量级建模技术和积极基准测试。

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource
languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital
inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic
literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a
focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques,
challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020
procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic
Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We
include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African
languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies
(score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74
datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of
speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset
licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are
promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage
of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use
Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores
such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with
limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing
evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset
availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited
benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and
methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable
development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation
of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques,
and active benchmarking.

Motivation: 大型语言模型评估在英语中已被广泛采用且有效，但其性能在非英语环境中表现不佳，目前尚不清楚什么是有效的多语言训练策略。

Method: 提出了mR3模型，通过综合研究数据和课程选择策略，包括整合目标语言推理数据集，来构建高质量奖励模型。

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in
English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their
performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains
unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In
this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward
reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language
coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data
and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data
sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of
target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art
performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger
models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness
is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and

TL;DR: MASH是一个通过强化学习训练LLMs选择性寻求外部帮助的框架，将搜索工具使用作为弃权的代理指标，在提高答案准确性的同时惩罚不必要的搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs无法可靠识别其参数知识边界，经常对超出边界的问题产生幻觉回答，而人类能够意识到自身局限并寻求外部帮助或弃权。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，通过按次搜索付费的奖励机制，在奖励答案准确性的同时惩罚外部搜索行为，从而训练LLMs选择性寻求帮助。

Result: 在三个知识密集型QA数据集上的实验显示，MASH显著优于先前的高效搜索方法，在多跳数据集上答案准确率提高7.6%，并能有效区分可回答/不可回答问题。

Conclusion: MASH训练有效对齐了搜索工具使用与参数知识，无需预先确定知识边界即可实现弃权决策，展示了与专门弃权方法类似的行为。

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and
often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans
recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such
questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via
Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions
from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.
search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help
(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer
accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a
pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show
that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of
prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer
accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf
abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and
selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior
analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to
prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge
boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a
by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall,
we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric
knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

### [150] [Backdoor Attacks Against Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01157)
*Alexandrine Fortier,Thomas Thebaud,Jesús Villalba,Najim Dehak,Patrick Cardinal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了针对语音语言模型的音频后门攻击，在四个语音编码器和三个数据集上验证了攻击有效性，并提出基于微调的防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型及其多模态扩展的普及，级联领域特定编码器与LLM的方法使模型继承了所有组件的漏洞，需要研究音频后门攻击的威胁。

Method: 通过系统研究音频后门攻击，在四个语音编码器和三个数据集上测试攻击效果，并进行组件级分析识别最脆弱的管道阶段。

Result: 攻击在四个任务（自动语音识别、语音情感识别、性别和年龄预测）中持续实现高成功率，范围从90.76%到99.41%。

Conclusion: 提出了基于微调的防御方法，能够减轻被污染预训练编码器的威胁，为多模态模型安全提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming
increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade
domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit
vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets,
covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion
recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves
high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how
backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most
vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based
defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了社会福祉函数基准测试，评估LLM在资源分配中的表现，发现大多数模型具有强烈的功利主义倾向，优先考虑群体效率而非公平分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM被委托做出影响人类福祉的高风险决策，需要研究这些模型在分配稀缺社会资源时所依据的原则和价值观。

Method: 引入社会福祉函数基准测试，这是一个动态模拟环境，让LLM作为主权分配者向异质社区分配任务，在集体效率和分配公平之间创造持久权衡。

Result: 评估了20个最先进的LLM，发现：(i) 通用对话能力不能预测分配技能；(ii) 大多数LLM具有强烈的功利主义倾向；(iii) 分配策略高度脆弱，易受输出长度约束和社会影响框架的干扰。

Conclusion: 当前LLM作为社会决策者存在风险，需要专门的基准测试和有针对性的对齐来改进AI治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes
decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that
guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely
unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF)
Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign
allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The
benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing
collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring
distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20
state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare
allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general
conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor
predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default
utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of
severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily
perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These
results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal
decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted
alignment for AI governance.

*Oussama Gabouj,Kamel Charaf,Ivan Zakazov,Nicolas Baldwin,Robert West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GRAD方法，通过训练LLM生成针对特定输入的简洁演示，在预算限制下优于传统RAG方法，并在数学推理和STEM问题上展现强大泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法依赖静态数据库，缺乏适应性且可能提供不相关的演示，限制了LLM在上下文支持方面的效果。

Method: 训练LLM模型生成输入特定的简洁演示，动态地为每个输入定制演示内容，在令牌数量限制下优化演示生成。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-14B模型上，GRAD在数学推理和STEM问题上持续优于基线方法，展现出对物理、化学、计算机科学等OOD领域的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRAD引入了一个可扩展的演示生成器模型，为资源受限环境下的动态少样本学习范式迈出了第一步，同时小模型生成的演示能有效指导大模型，降低训练成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks,
but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external
information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and
can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative
Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach
where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise
demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers
better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the
superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of
tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final
output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong
baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM
questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we
show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively
guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining
competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration
generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning
paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the
project.

*Jiayi Zhang,Simon Yu,Derek Chong,Anthony Sicilia,Michael R. Tomz,Christopher D. Manning,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现后训练对齐导致LLM多样性减少（模式崩溃）的根本原因是偏好数据中的典型性偏见，并提出了一种无需训练的提示策略——言语化采样，能显著提升模型在创意写作等任务中的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练对齐经常减少LLM的多样性，导致模式崩溃。与先前研究将这种现象归因于算法限制不同，本文识别出一个根本性的数据层面驱动因素：偏好数据中的典型性偏见。

Method: 提出言语化采样（Verbalized Sampling），这是一种简单的无需训练的提示策略，让模型对一组回答进行概率分布的言语化表达（例如“生成5个关于咖啡的笑话及其对应概率”）。

Result: 综合实验表明，VS显著提升了创意写作（诗歌、故事、笑话）、对话模拟、开放式问答和合成数据生成等任务的性能，在创意写作中多样性提高了1.6-2.1倍，且不牺牲事实准确性和安全性。

Conclusion: 本文为模式崩溃提供了新的数据中心视角，并提出了一种实用的推理时补救措施，有助于释放预训练生成模型的多样性。

Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon
known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to
algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level
driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,
training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the
model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,
``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').
Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance
across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,
open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual
accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity
by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that
more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new
data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy
that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

*Qingyuan Liu,Jia-Chen Gu,Yunzhi Yao,Hong Wang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出SPHERE方法，通过超球面能量正则化来稳定神经元权重分布，解决大语言模型顺序编辑中的性能退化问题，在保持原有知识的同时实现可靠的顺序更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要持续更新以保持与现实世界知识同步，但顺序编辑会导致表示不稳定和灾难性遗忘。作者假设超球面均匀性有助于模型保持稳定并容纳新知识。

Method: 使用超球面能量量化编辑过程中的神经元均匀性，提出SPHERE方法：识别与预训练权重矩阵主超球面方向互补的稀疏空间，并将新知识投影到该空间，减少对主方向的扰动。

Result: 在LLaMA3和Qwen2.5上的实验表明，SPHERE在编辑能力上平均优于最佳基线16.41%，同时最忠实地保持了一般模型性能。

Conclusion: SPHERE提供了一种原则性的方法来实现可靠的大规模知识编辑，通过稳定超球面能量来保持先验知识并实现可靠的顺序更新。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with
evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative
to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and
induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and
mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize
that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution
of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior
knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy
(HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation
with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods
reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with
editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further
theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of
pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge
retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection
for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization
strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving
prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically,
SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical
directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto
it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive
experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the
best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most
faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled
path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

Abstract: As autonomous systems move from prototypes to real deployments, the ability
of multiple agents to make decentralized, cooperative decisions becomes a core
requirement. This paper examines how agentic artificial intelligence, agents
that act independently, adaptively and proactively can improve task allocation
and coordination in multi-agent systems, with primary emphasis on drone
delivery and secondary relevance to warehouse automation. We formulate the
problem in a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning setting and
implement a lightweight multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization, called IPPO,
approach in PyTorch under a centralized-training, decentralized-execution
paradigm. Experiments are conducted in PettingZoo environment, where multiple
homogeneous drones or agents must self-organize to cover distinct targets
without explicit communication.

Conclusion: ToolBrain为研究人员和从业者提供了一个用户友好的框架，能够有效训练LLM代理在特定领域使用工具，框架已在https://toolbrain.org公开。

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Motivation: 大推理语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在计算效率低下的问题，现有方法难以平衡推理质量与推理成本降低。

Method: ARS采用免训练方法，通过多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值，动态抑制冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟减少和57.9%的能耗减少，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS方法能有效解决大推理语言模型的过思考问题，在显著提升推理效率的同时保持推理质量。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,

Motivation: 当前AI政策制定缺乏科学共识形成机制，而NeurIPS作为AI领域的领导者，具备推动科学共识形成的独特优势，能够帮助制定更高质量的AI政策。

Method: 建议NeurIPS通过初步试点项目，借鉴IPCC在气候政策共识形成方面的经验教训，主动催化AI政策领域的科学共识。

Result: 识别了当前AI政策共识形成机制的完全缺失，论证了NeurIPS是最佳选择，并提出了具体的实施建议。

Conclusion: NeurIPS应该在AI政策科学共识形成方面发挥领导作用，通过建立共识机制来提升AI政策的质量。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的兴起，法律判决预测系统可能利用罪犯图像信息，这可能带来意外后果或被恶意使用。需要评估VLMs在保释决策中的表现并设计干预措施。

Method: 1. 审计独立VLMs在保释预测任务中的表现；2. 通过RAG管道引入法律先例；3. 使用创新方案微调VLMs。

Result: 独立VLMs在多个交叉群体中表现不佳，会错误地高置信度拒绝应获保释者。干预措施显著提高了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 在将VLMs部署到真实世界法律判决预测前，需要设计更智能的干预措施。这项工作为未来VLMs干预设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,

cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory

retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手工编写大量恢复规则，无法应对现实世界中各种意外情况，且容易变得不完整。需要更智能的自适应决策系统。

Method: 利用具身AI和大型视觉语言模型，在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，让无人机动态理解环境并实时生成适当的紧急着陆动作。

Result: 研究表明具身AI能够实现之前手工设计不可行的自适应恢复和决策流程，提高了自主航空系统的韧性和安全性。

Conclusion: 具身AI技术为自主无人机系统开启了一类新的自适应恢复和决策能力，显著提升了系统在面对突发事件时的安全性和适应性。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成稳健、可移植且经过执行验证的数据库查询。它集成了TS-SQL合成数据流水线和TS-GRPO强化学习目标，显著提高了执行成功率和结果匹配率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠的生产级数据转换具有挑战性：正确性依赖于精确的模式链接和仓库特定的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督（执行成功和结果匹配）仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型执行验证语料库成本高昂，且令牌级目标与这些全局信号不匹配，导致优化不稳定和可移植性有限。

Method: Thinkquel集成了一个新颖的合成数据流水线TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，以及一个跨度感知的强化学习目标TS-GRPO，专门设计用于在微调LLMs时弥合令牌级训练信号和序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）通过两阶段SFT课程达到了93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配率，相对于基础模型分别提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO相对于GRPO和GSPO提高了训练稳定性并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过其合成数据流水线和强化学习目标，显著提高了自然语言到SQL转换的稳健性、可移植性和执行验证能力，为解决令牌级和序列级信号不匹配的问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦微调方法和DualTune推理框架，将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，通过专用LoRA适配器提升本地LLM在工具调用场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地LLM在工具调用场景中表现不如前沿模型，特别是在大规模工具集选择和复杂参数结构生成方面存在困难，需要隐私保护且成本效益高的本地推理解决方案。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调创建专用适配器，分别处理工具选择和工具特定参数生成，使用分离的损失掩码。DualTune推理框架动态加载相应LoRA适配器，并实现分层编排来限制工具选择数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，在所有情况下都优于相似大小的其他本地推理、非推理和微调模型，在大多数情况下也优于2倍大小的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调和DualTune框架有效提升了本地LLM在工具调用任务中的性能，为设备端推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MAGIC-MASK框架，将基于扰动的可解释性方法扩展到多智能体强化学习，通过智能体间协作共享掩码状态信息和奖励洞察，提高关键状态发现效率和解释保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习智能体决策过程的可解释性问题，特别是在安全关键和多智能体环境中。现有方法如StateMask存在计算成本高、探索覆盖不足、缺乏多智能体适应等限制。

Method: 集成近端策略优化、自适应ε-贪婪探索和轻量级智能体间协作，通过轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化的统一数学形式化，实现基于概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程的局部化可解释解释。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中验证，包括多智能体高速公路驾驶环境和Google Research Football，MAGIC-MASK在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将可解释性从单智能体系统推广到多智能体系统，提供可解释和可转移的解释，同时实现更快、更鲁棒的学习。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

*Serena Gomez Wannaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL指南虽然能提升特定任务性能，但会损害跨领域推理能力，导致"优化脆弱性"现象：在简单任务上表现优异(91%-99%)，但在复杂推理问题上性能显著下降(10-43%)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL指南对跨领域认知能力的影响，特别是对推理灵活性的系统性影响。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的6个变体（1个基线+5种ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识、逻辑谜题和数学奥林匹克问题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在逻辑谜题上准确率降至10-43%（基线为43%）；数学奥林匹克问题无显著差异(p=0.2173)。ANOVA分析显示显著行为改变(p<0.001)。

Conclusion: ICL指南在效率和推理灵活性之间产生系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全具有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM工具选择偏见的基准，发现模型存在不公平偏好，并提出了轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具市场，但系统性的选择偏见会损害用户体验和市场竞争公平性。

Method: 构建包含功能等效工具的多样化基准，测试7个模型，通过控制实验分析偏见来源，并提出基于过滤和均匀采样的缓解方法。

Result: 发现模型存在固定偏好或列表位置偏见；语义对齐是主要预测因素；描述扰动显著影响选择；预训练暴露会放大偏见。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强LLM公平部署的关键障碍，提出的缓解方法能有效减少偏见同时保持任务覆盖。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI在对抗性高风险环境中的严重缺陷，即使最先进的模型也难以应对主动欺骗和不可逆错误的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估主要关注受控环境下的任务完成度，但现实世界部署需要模型具备对抗误导信息的韧性。加密货币市场作为测试平台，2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，凸显了这一问题的重要性。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，在178个时间锚定任务上评估17个模型，要求代理区分真相与操纵、在碎片化信息环境中导航，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆的金融决策。

Result: 无工具时，前沿模型仅达到28%准确率；工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于80%的人类基准。模型存在系统性工具选择灾难，偏好不可靠的网页搜索而非权威数据源。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上表现优异，但在需要对抗主动反对的环境中仍基本未准备好。对抗鲁棒性应成为可信AI自主性的必要条件。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Motivation: Transformer在逻辑推理方面存在困难，可能是因为缺乏对潜在空间和循环推理等创造性使用的探索。Hierarchical Reasoning Model虽然展现了潜力，但仍处于早期阶段需要深入研究

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme和Maze-Hard任务上取得了比之前报告显著更好的性能

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和有趣的研究方向，为进一步研究提供了启示

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

Motivation: 现有智能体基准面临新开发智能体快速达到性能天花板的问题，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要一种可持续演进的评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提案挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提案）、问题形成与自由探索（将提案转化为可行问题候选，记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保进化任务具有可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准上的实验表明，TRACE框架能够持续提升任务复杂度，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、人工策划的基准向动态、自我进化评估系统的范式转变，为智能体开发提供了可持续且具有挑战性的跑道。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI回答患者健康问题的黄金标准——专家评审——耗时且难以扩展，需要更高效的自动化评估方法。

Method: 对100个患者病例，收集28个AI系统的2800个回答，从三个维度评估：是否回答问题、恰当使用临床笔记证据、使用一般医学知识，使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为评估基准。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度匹配，表明自动化评估方法有效。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS)方法，通过语义丰富的状态表示和动作掩码方案，在足球等入侵性团队运动中构建可解释的球员级智能体模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要构建既能从数据中学习，又具有战术可解释性且能在异构数据源间保持鲁棒性的球员级智能体模型。

Method: EDMS方法通过增强原始位置和速度信息，加入关系变量（如空间得分、传球和得分评估），并结合动作掩码方案，为持球和非持球球员提供不同的决策集合。

Result: 与基线相比，EDMS结合动作掩码持续降低了动作预测损失和时序差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示EDMS能够突出高风险高回报的战术模式。

Conclusion: EDMS方法成功地将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念，并与比赛规则保持一致，实现了跨数据源的可复现实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: 研究发现传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)的假设是错误的，在14个不同领域的评估中，生成式结果奖励模型(GenORM)表现最稳健，而过程奖励模型由于标签噪声和长推理轨迹评估困难而表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在测试时扩展的可靠性通常使用外部验证器或奖励模型，传统观点认为过程奖励模型优于结果奖励模型，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据，需要在更广泛的领域进行验证。

Method: 在14个不同领域统一评估了四种奖励模型变体：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)，通过理论分析和实证观察来比较它们的性能。

Result: 与常规认知相反：(1) DisORM与DisPRM表现相当；(2) GenPRM不具有竞争力；(3) GenORM是最稳健的模型，在所有测试领域都取得了显著且一致的增益。过程奖励模型由于LLM自动标注的标签噪声和评估长推理轨迹的困难而表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的普遍假设，支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证。过程奖励模型在长推理轨迹中会累积错误，而结果奖励模型在多样化领域中表现更稳健。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}

box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

*Leopold Müller,Joshua Holstein,Sarah Bause,Gerhard Satzger,Niklas Kühl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究针对RAG系统开发了15个数据质量维度，覆盖数据提取、转换、提示与搜索、生成四个处理阶段，发现需要扩展传统DQ框架并采用前置质量管理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统的动态、多阶段特性，需要开发专门针对这类AI系统的DQ维度。

Method: 通过对领先IT服务公司从业者进行16次半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳得出DQ维度。

Result: 识别出15个不同的DQ维度，分布在RAG系统的四个处理阶段；发现新维度主要集中在早期步骤，DQ问题会在管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 需要将新维度添加到传统DQ框架中，采用前置质量管理策略，并实施动态、步骤感知的质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散语言模型(DLMs)在迭代去噪过程中的安全漏洞，攻击者可通过注入肯定令牌绕过安全防护，并提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪生成令牌，但其推理机制带来的安全风险尚未得到充分理解，特别是越狱攻击可能利用这一机制。

Method: 研究发现如果在中间步骤出现有害查询的肯定令牌，后续去噪过程可能被引导生成有害响应。基于此分析，提出了一种针对DLMs的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明所提方法显著缓解了该漏洞，对任务性能影响最小，并提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对扩散语言模型进行特定安全研究的必要性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent Context Optimization (ACON)框架，通过优化压缩指南来压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少长序列任务的上下文长度，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能体在动态真实环境中部署时，由于需要积累长历史行动和观察而导致的上下文长度增长问题，这增加了成本并降低了长序列任务的效率。

Method: ACON框架在自然语言空间中优化压缩指南：当完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败时，利用LLM分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指南；还将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小的模型中以减少额外模块的开销。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验表明，ACON减少了26-54%的内存使用（峰值token数），同时基本保持任务性能；当蒸馏到更小的压缩器时保持超过95%的准确率；将较小的LM作为长序列智能体使用时性能提升高达46%。

Conclusion: ACON提供了一种有效的上下文压缩方法，能够在显著减少内存使用的同时保持任务性能，并通过蒸馏技术实现高效部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA是一个基于人类研究者思维流程的自动化科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间，并生成可测试的假设。相比基线AI研究者，HARPA在可行性和基础性方面表现更优，并能从实验经验中学习改进假设评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成既可测试又基于科学文献的假设，且无法适应先前的实验结果。HARPA旨在通过模拟人类研究者的思维流程来解决这些挑战。

Method: HARPA采用三阶段方法：1）通过文献挖掘识别新兴研究趋势；2）探索假设设计空间；3）通过定位研究空白和论证设计选择来收敛到精确可测试的假设。系统还学习基于先前实验结果的奖励模型来评分新假设。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)方面显著优于基线AI研究者。与ASD代理CodeScientist测试时，HARPA产生更多成功执行(20 vs 11)和更少失败(16 vs 21)。奖励模型相比未训练基线获得约28%的绝对增益。

Conclusion: HARPA的方法在AI驱动的科学发现领域迈出了重要一步，通过模拟人类研究者的思维流程和从经验中学习，能够生成更可行、更基于文献的假设。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了当前模型编辑方法的脆弱性，指出其成功可能基于利用隐藏捷径而非真实语义，挑战了模型编辑文献的基础可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型编码的过时或不正确知识需要更新，但现有模型编辑方法可能存在根本性缺陷，需要重新评估其可靠性。

Method: 开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负例测试，系统性地检验模型编辑方法的鲁棒性。

Result: 发现最先进的模型编辑方法在简单的否定查询下就会崩溃，表明编辑可能基于捷径而非完整语义理解。

Conclusion: 模型编辑领域需要从根本上重新考虑其基础，因为捷径机制与稳健的知识整合存在本质冲突，当前的成功可能是虚幻的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现出色，但模型规模大、采样速度慢，阻碍了在实际自动驾驶和智能交通系统中的部署应用。

Method: 基于协作渐进式蒸馏(CPD)，逐步将高容量教师扩散模型的知识转移到轻量级学生模型中，同时减少采样步骤和模型规模，并引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失。

Result: 在ETH-UCY和nuScenes基准测试中达到最先进预测精度，仅需231K参数和2-4采样步骤，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟，保持96.2% ADE和95.5% FDE性能。

Conclusion: CDDM成功将高性能生成模型与实用部署约束相结合，为自动驾驶和智能交通系统提供资源高效的概概率预测解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Expected Attention的训练免费KV缓存压缩方法，通过预测未来查询如何关注KV对来估计其重要性，从而有效压缩内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存消耗是大型语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈，现有基于注意力分数的KV缓存修剪方法面临实际限制：未来token的注意力分数在压缩时不可用，且现代实现如Flash Attention不生成完整注意力矩阵。

Method: 利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，基于这些分数进行原则性排序和修剪，最小化对残差流的影响。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的Expected Attention方法能够在不影响性能的情况下有效压缩KV缓存，同时发布了KVPress库，包含20多种技术供研究人员实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and

ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏求解面临指数级增长的博弈树问题，现有的相关区域（RZ）方法虽然能减少搜索空间，但不同解会产生不同大小的RZ，较小的RZ更有利于重用和剪枝效率。

Method: 设计迭代RZ缩减方法，重复求解同一位置并逐步限制涉及区域；提出三种约束生成策略，并集成RZ模式表以充分利用历史解。

Result: 在7×7 Killall-Go实验中，平均RZ大小减少到原始的85.95%，缩减后的RZ可作为可重用知识存储。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减小RZ大小，提升求解效率，缩减后的RZ可作为永久性知识用于未来更大棋盘或不同开局的求解任务。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了现有策略优化算法的局限性，为大规模视觉语言模型的对齐训练提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

Conclusion: 数据增强管道有效提升了定理证明模型的鲁棒性，EvolProver在多个基准测试中创造了新的最先进记录，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: DDIM反演技术使恶意用户能轻松合成虚假内容，现有防御方法在破坏扩散过程方面效果不佳，需要更有效的防御手段。

Result: DIA方法在各种编辑方法上都实现了有效的破坏，性能超过之前的防御方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为行业和研究社区提供了实用的AI恶意使用防御方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了AI（特别是像ChatGPT这样的大语言模型）在教育环境中的整合，重点关注对教学的影响。研究发现AI工具能简化任务和增强学习，但也存在学生过度依赖的风险，可能阻碍认知和问题解决能力的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在教育中的应用潜力及其对教学和学习的影响，特别关注数据科学课程中的实际应用情况。

Method: 通过对瓦赫宁根大学数据科学课程协调员进行访谈，收集关于AI工具在课堂中使用的经验和观点。

Result: 识别出AI在教育中的双重影响：一方面能提高效率和学习体验，另一方面可能导致学生过度依赖，影响基础技能发展。同时强调了负责任使用AI、伦理考量和评估方法调整的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过谨慎整合，AI可以成为教育中的宝贵资产，但必须确保其补充而非替代基本学习过程，需要平衡技术应用与教育目标。

Abstract: This study explores the integration of AI, particularly large language models
(LLMs) like ChatGPT, into educational settings, focusing on the implications
for teaching and learning. Through interviews with course coordinators from
data science courses at Wageningen University, this research identifies both
the benefits and challenges associated with AI in the classroom. While AI tools
can streamline tasks and enhance learning, concerns arise regarding students'
overreliance on these technologies, potentially hindering the development of
essential cognitive and problem solving skills. The study highlights the
importance of responsible AI usage, ethical considerations, and the need for
adapting assessment methods to ensure educational outcomes are met. With
careful integration, AI can be a valuable asset in education, provided it is
used to complement rather than replace fundamental learning processes.

TL;DR: 提出了ChemX数据集，包含10个手工整理且经过领域专家验证的数据集，用于评估和改进化学信息提取方法。通过基准测试比较现有最先进的代理系统，并引入单代理方法，揭示了化学信息提取中的持续挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学信息提取由于化学数据的固有异质性而面临严峻挑战，现有的基于代理的方法在该领域表现有限，需要专门的基准来推动该领域的发展。

Method: 创建了ChemX数据集，包含10个手工整理且经过领域专家验证的数据集；进行了广泛的基准测试，比较了ChatGPT Agent、化学特定数据提取代理等现有系统；引入了单代理方法，允许在提取前精确控制文档预处理；评估了GPT-5和GPT-5 Thinking等现代基线模型。

Conclusion: ChemX基准是推动化学自动化信息提取的关键资源，挑战了现有方法的泛化能力，并为有效评估策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

*Nicholas Leisegang,Giovanni Casini,Thomas Meyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 比较加权知识库与c-representations两种处理不一致知识库的方法，分析它们在语义层面的等价性和可表达性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在知识库不一致的情况下，需要形式化方法来处理冲突。加权知识库和c-representations是两种不同的方法，但都使用数值化机制来评估解释的质量，需要比较它们的语义等价性

Method: 在语义层面比较两种方法：加权知识库通过权重和成本函数评估解释，c-representations通过惩罚违反条件来分配数值排名。分析在特定条件下两种方法能否生成相同的解释排序

Result: 证明在特定条件下，加权知识库和一组可废止条件可以生成相同的解释排序，达到语义结构上的相对成本等价。同时比较了两种形式主义中的蕴涵关系，发现某些概念在两种形式主义中具有等价的可表达性

Conclusion: 两种方法在语义层面存在等价关系，这一结果有助于进一步研究基于成本的语义和c-representations，为两种形式主义的交叉应用提供了理论基础

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

### [193] [Logical Consistency Between Disagreeing Experts and Its Role in AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00821)
*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无监督评估分类器的逻辑框架，通过分析分类器之间的一致性与分歧来推断其性能，无需真实标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当专家对测试结果完全一致时，无法排除任何可能的评估结果；但当他们意见分歧时，可以确定至少有一方不正确。这种一致性与分歧的不对称性激发了无监督评估方法的研究。

Method: 将分类器决策的一致性统计作为输入，构建整数空间中的线性规划问题。利用逻辑约束（如正确响应数不能超过观察响应数）和适用于所有有限测试的通用线性等式公理。

Result: 开发了无需知识的警报系统，能够检测LLM作为评判者是否违反用户指定的最低评分阈值。

Conclusion: 基于逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法具有实际应用价值，能够在不依赖真实标签的情况下评估分类器性能。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次对电力系统保护中的故障分类和故障定位进行了经典机器学习模型的比较基准研究，使用EMT数据评估模型在实时约束下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式能源资源（特别是可再生能源）的日益集成对电力系统保护提出了重大挑战，传统的基于固定阈值的保护方案无法在动态条件下可靠识别和定位短路故障。

Method: 使用电压和电流波形，将其分割为10毫秒到50毫秒的滑动窗口，在实时约束下评估经典机器学习模型在故障分类和故障定位中的性能。

Result: 最佳故障分类模型F1得分为0.992±0.001，最佳故障定位模型R2为0.806±0.008，平均处理时间为0.563毫秒。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型在电力系统故障分类和定位方面表现出色，能够满足实时保护需求，为复杂电网环境下的保护方案提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

TL;DR: 该研究使用SMOTE技术解决加密货币市场中Pump and Dump操纵检测的类别不平衡问题，并通过集成学习模型实现了高召回率的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币市场中Pump and Dump操纵事件的稀缺性导致严重的类别不平衡，阻碍了准确的检测。

Method: 应用合成少数类过采样技术(SMOTE)，并评估先进的集成学习模型来区分操纵性交易行为与正常市场活动。

Result: SMOTE显著提升了所有模型检测P&D事件的能力，XGBoost和LightGBM分别达到94.87%和93.59%的高召回率，并具有快速计算性能。

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法结合显著提高了操纵活动的早期检测能力，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

*Jianhao Chen,Chenxu Wang,Gengrui Zhang,Peng Ye,Lei Bai,Wei Hu,Yuzhong Qu,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于项目反应理论(IRT)的方法，学习大语言模型(LLM)能力的紧凑表示，用于模型路由和性能预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型数量的激增，如何有效管理和利用这些庞大资源成为重要挑战。需要学习LLM能力的紧凑表示来支持下游任务。

Method: 采用项目反应理论框架，将模型正确回答查询的概率建模为三个因素的函数：模型的多技能能力向量、查询的区分度向量和查询难度标量。使用混合专家(MoE)网络联合学习这些参数。

Result: 实验表明该方法在模型路由和基准精度预测任务上达到最先进性能，学习到的参数能够编码关于模型能力和查询特征的有意义、可解释信息。

Conclusion: 提出的基于IRT的方法能够有效学习LLM能力的紧凑表示，为模型管理和性能预测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的自动化洞察和数据探索方法AIDE，用于解决从数据中提取可操作知识的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织面临将海量数据转化为可操作知识的困难，自动化知识发现存在数据导航、模型构建和主观目标考量等复杂问题。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索框架构建AIDE系统，通过探索数据转换和模型来发现有趣的数据模式。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的评估表明，AIDE能有效识别数据转换和模型，揭示有意义的数据模式。

Conclusion: AIDE为自动化知识发现提供了可扩展的基础框架，未来可集成更多模式提取策略和领域知识。

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

### [198] [FusionAdapter for Few-Shot Relation Learning in Multimodal Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00894)
*Ran Liu,Yuan Fang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionAdapter是一种用于多模态知识图谱中少样本关系学习的方法，通过适配器模块和融合策略有效整合多模态信息，在低资源设置下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将不同模态对齐到共享空间，忽视了特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 提出FusionAdapter，包含适配器模块用于各模态到未见关系的有效适应，以及融合策略在整合多模态实体表示时保留模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的广泛实验表明，FusionAdapter优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合来自不同模态的信息，FusionAdapter在最小监督下提高了对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了DAIL算法，通过LLM引导的进化框架自动发现数据驱动的奖励分配函数，显著提升了对抗模仿学习的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗模仿学习(AIL)方法虽然有效但被认为不稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计，而奖励分配函数的作用被忽视，通常依赖于人工设计。本文旨在探索数据驱动的奖励分配函数。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架来探索奖励分配函数空间，基于模仿策略的性能直接优化奖励分配函数，提出了首个元学习的AIL算法DAIL。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法上表现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL提供了更稳定的训练，为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

TL;DR: 提出一种增强训练模型推理性能的方法，通过随机性测试时搜索来改进CVRP中的切割平面分离，能够生成更多样化的切割子集并首次识别框架容量不等式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的分离方法在生成切割时多样性不足，产生的切割数量少于预期，需要提高模型对生成子集的敏感性。

Method: 在推理时引入随机性搜索：1）在图粗化过程中使用随机边选择替代贪心方法；2）提出GraphCHiP算法，利用粗化历史识别圆整容量不等式和框架容量不等式。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上，相比现有神经分离方法，本方法能有效减少对偶间隙，并在特定实例上成功识别出有效的框架容量不等式。

Conclusion: 通过测试时随机性搜索和GraphCHiP算法，能够增强训练模型的推理性能，生成更高质量的切割，包括具有挑战性的框架容量不等式。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network
architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference
systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time

to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy
inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting
performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing
meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the
real world stock market index S\&P500. Initial results show potential for
interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs,
suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market

Conclusion: QUASAR框架显著提升了生成量子电路的语法和语义性能，证明了工具增强LLM在量子计算领域的有效性。

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

Conclusion: AFFR为罕见病的公平可信联邦诊断提供了一条实用路径，统一解决了数据稀缺、设备稳定性和隐私保护等关键问题。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow - request specification,
model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated narratives - so
planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is accuracy heading
and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between forecasting,
monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries and about
6,000 parts.

TL;DR: SMDS方法自动发现语言模型中的特征流形，揭示概念在潜在空间中的几何结构（如圆形、直线、簇），这些结构稳定、支持推理并随上下文动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅关注特定特征的特定几何结构，缺乏通用性，需要一种模型无关的方法来自动发现特征流形。

Method: 提出监督多维缩放（SMDS）方法，以时间推理为案例研究，自动发现语言模型中的特征流形几何结构。

Result: 发现不同特征形成多种几何结构（圆形、直线、簇），这些结构：反映概念属性、跨模型稳定、支持推理、随上下文动态变化。

Conclusion: 特征流形在语言模型中发挥功能性作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，语言模型编码和转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了70多个不同架构的LLM在概念表示方面与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数规模影响有限。现有基准测试无法完全捕捉人类-AI对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的快速发展带来了多种计算要素，但尚不清楚哪些要素对构建具有人类类似表示的模型最关键。现有LLM基准测试不适合测量人类与模型之间的表示对齐，使得基准分数无法可靠评估LLM是否在成为有用认知模型方面取得进展。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务方法，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估了70多个在计算要素上差异很大的模型。比较了人类和模型的表示，并分析了对齐分数与现有基准测试分数的相关性。

Result: 发现经过指令微调的模型和具有更大注意力头维度的模型与人类对齐度最高，而多模态预训练和参数规模对对齐度影响有限。某些基准测试（如MMLU）比其他基准测试（如MUSR）更适合捕捉表示对齐，但没有现有基准能够完全解释对齐分数的方差。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于突出推进LLM成为人类概念表示模型的最关键计算要素，并解决了LLM评估中的一个关键基准测试空白。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭模型中与遮挡部分对应的组件来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法因遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡部分输入来生成解释，但这会产生分布外图像，影响解释质量。同时，选择合适的遮挡值需要领域知识，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 提出了ConvAD机制，可以轻松添加到任何训练好的卷积神经网络中，实现AD范式。该方法不需要额外训练或微调，通过关闭模型中与遮挡区域对应的组件来消除其影响。

Result: 实验表明AD解释在多个数据集和模型架构上都比传统遮挡方法更鲁棒，鲁棒性提升高达62.5%。ConvAD机制不会改变网络的决策过程。

Conclusion: ConvAD能够提取更鲁棒的解释，无需领域知识选择遮挡值，解决了传统黑盒解释方法的关键限制。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

TL;DR: 提出基于Curry-Howard对应的理论框架，将CoT推理轨迹映射为形式化类型证明结构，以验证推理的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CoT提示增强了语言模型的推理能力，但生成的推理过程是否忠实仍是一个开放问题，影响模型可解释性。

Method: 利用Curry-Howard对应关系，将非正式的自然语言推理步骤提取并映射到形式化的类型证明结构中。

Result: 成功将CoT轨迹转换为良好类型的证明，可作为计算忠实性的强可验证证书。

Conclusion: 该框架为将可信的叙述性解释转化为形式化可验证程序提供了方法，有助于构建更可靠和可信的AI系统。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: SIRL利用大语言模型内部的安全信念，将拒绝有害请求时的高置信度转化为自我奖励信号，无需外部验证器即可实现有效对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏通用标准和可靠的内容验证器，确保大语言模型安全面临挑战，难以获得有效的训练信号。

Method: 提出Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL)，将模型内部的安全置信度转化为自我生成的奖励信号，强化低熵拒绝行为。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上评估，SIRL对20+种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个无标签提示即可超越资源密集的监督方法。

Conclusion: 有效的对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督即可扩展的自主、鲁棒AI安全机制铺平道路。

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业制造中同时优化运营效率和劳动力公平性，将机器调度与考虑工人偏好、经验、适应性和医疗约束的人力因素整合。

Method: 第一层使用约束规划(CP)进行订单-产线分配，第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行工人-产线分配，并比较了贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种解决方案策略。

Result: CP调度方法产生紧凑可行的生产计划，延迟率低；MDP工人分配显著提高了公平性和偏好对齐度；领域专家认为两个组件都有效。

Conclusion: 结合CP与基于学习的决策为人本生产规划提供了稳健方法，能够同时优化吞吐量和劳动力福祉，为工业环境中的公平高效制造调度提供了实用基础。

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Motivation: 为了在急诊科环境中实现安全、可审计、低延迟的大规模咨询，同时避免常见事件主导结果，需要开发一个实用的临床部署框架。

Method: 使用结构化临床事件作为标记，轻量级路由器读取前几个标记并分派到专科模型（心脏血管、肺部、胃肠食管、肌肉骨骼、心理源性），每个专科继承PRISM的小型transformer骨干和标记模板。

Result: 在真实世界急诊科队列中，专科模型在各领域表现出平滑收敛和低开发困惑度，路由器在安全优先策略下实现高质量路由和大幅计算节省。

Conclusion: 该框架为安全、可审计、低延迟的大规模咨询提供了实用路径，并概述了满足前瞻性临床部署标准的验证步骤。

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂的多模态金融风险数据时存在困难，标准检索增强生成方法过度简化关系，而专业模型成本高且静态。

Method: 将供应链网络视为知识图谱，利用网络中心性评分指导图遍历提取经济显著性风险路径，结合数值因子表和新闻流数据，使用上下文模板嵌入原始数据到自然语言中。

Result: 该轻量级方法使模型能够实时生成简洁、可解释且上下文丰富的风险叙述，无需昂贵的微调或专用图数据库。

Conclusion: 通过利用网络与知识图谱之间的内在对偶性，提出了一个有效的LLM中心智能体框架来解决供应链风险分析问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

Motivation: 旨在证明通过精心的训练设计而非单纯扩大规模，可以在有限计算资源下实现前沿水平的多模态推理能力，使更多组织能够使用先进AI技术。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进方法：1）深度扩展推理能力；2）分阶段持续预训练，包括基础文本视觉理解和针对性合成数据增强视觉推理；3）高质量文本监督微调，涵盖数学、编程、科学和工具使用。

Result: 在Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index上获得52分，与DeepSeek-R1-0528相当但计算资源更少；在10个图像基准测试中平均性能接近Gemini-2.5-Flash和Claude Sonnet-3.7，可在单GPU上部署。

Conclusion: 精心设计的中间训练方法可以在不依赖大规模计算的情况下显著缩小能力差距，使前沿多模态推理技术对基础设施有限的组织更加可及。

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and
tool use. Notably, our model achieves competitive results without reinforcement
learning or preference optimization, isolating the contribution of our
data-centric continual pre-training approach. On the Artificial Analysis

DeepSeek-R1-0528 despite requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
Across ten image benchmarks, its performance is on average within five points
of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7, a key achievement for a model
operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的并行LLM推理中，N个响应是独立生成的，这导致计算资源被分割，且一个生成中的有用信息无法被其他生成利用，与序列生成中利用过去计算的模式形成对比。

Method: 提出Bridge方法，通过重新设计批量LLM隐藏状态为整体张量而非独立切片，在并行生成响应时实现相互依赖，仅需添加少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%）。

Result: Bridge将基于可验证奖励的强化学习的相对平均准确率提升高达50%，并提高了正确响应的一致性。训练一次后，Bridge可扩展到任何生成宽度，性能均优于独立生成。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了一种更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间的信息，且与任何后生成聚合技术兼容。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了双角色交互中间帧生成的挑战，实现了长时程的稳定合成，在交互质量和运动质量方面都表现出色

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is the problem to synthesize movement between keyposes.
Traditional research focused primarily on single characters. Extending them to
densely interacting characters is highly challenging, as it demands precise
spatial-temporal correspondence between the characters to maintain the
interaction, while creating natural transitions towards predefined keyposes. In
this research, we present a method for long-horizon interaction in-betweening
that enables two characters to engage and respond to one another naturally. To
effectively represent and synthesize interactions, we propose a novel solution
called Cross-Space In-Betweening, which models the interactions of each
character across different conditioning representation spaces. We further
observe that the significantly increased constraints in interacting characters
heavily limit the solution space, leading to degraded motion quality and
diminished interaction over time. To enable long-horizon synthesis, we present
two solutions to maintain long-term interaction and motion quality, thereby
keeping synthesis in the stable region of the solution space.We first sustain
interaction quality by identifying periodic interaction patterns through
adversarial learning. We further maintain the motion quality by learning to
refine the drifted latent space and prevent pose error accumulation. We
demonstrate that our approach produces realistic, controllable, and
long-horizon in-between motions of two characters with dynamic boxing and
dancing actions across multiple keyposes, supported by extensive quantitative
evaluations and user studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维分布中Wasserstein距离计算成本过高，而切片Wasserstein距离(SWD)的蒙特卡洛估计器方差较大，导致梯度噪声大、收敛慢。

Method: 将加权水库采样整合到SWD中，在优化步骤中自适应地保留信息丰富的投影方向。

Result: 在合成基准测试和实际任务（如色彩校正和扩散引导）中，ReSWD始终优于标准SWD和其他方差减少基线方法。

Conclusion: ReSWD在保持无偏性的同时，通过降低方差提供了更稳定的梯度，提高了优化效率。

Abstract: Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the
widely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional
distributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable
alternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,
resulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD
(ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively
retain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in
stable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks
and real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that
ReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction
baselines. Project page: https://reservoirswd.github.io/

which are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the
generative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of
facial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving
real-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes
latency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates
dependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates
iterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design
challenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals
frame-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility
of our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic
modalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted
eye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.
We validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various
scenarios such as multilingual speeches.

Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet
elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack
flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper
introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm
from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be
seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a
simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single
reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion
Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion
(SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the
sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a
gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal
bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although
trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to
real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual
fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting
control.
