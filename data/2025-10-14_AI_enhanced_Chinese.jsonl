We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative\ndynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of\nthree models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively\nassign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole\"\ncommunity. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin\n(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our\nfindings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT\nshowed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were\nfar more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized\npersonal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized\nempathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving\nverdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact\non model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to\nClaude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects.

To enable scalable and adaptive\ncollaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based\nprobabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,\nsupporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without\nglobal supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and\nscientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,\nimproving both accuracy and reasoning stability.

However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric\nproperties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,\nwhich require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,\nwe present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),\nto leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into\ncell instances.

For each boundary candidate, a boundary\nfeature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling\npixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the\nneighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is\nused to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary\nsignature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging\nneighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels.

If the risk level\ncannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated\nsampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ\ncalibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated\nbudget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically\nvalid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the\ncandidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an\nadditional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby\ncontrolling the risk of correct answers being excluded.

High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution", "comment": null, "summary": "Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural\nbackgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social\nmedia. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either\non generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face\nsuper-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait\nphotos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general\nmodel processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably\nintroduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to\ndifferent model training recipes, while human perception is particularly\nsensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the\nportrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a\nsingle-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and\nupscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our\nmodel on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision\nmechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region.

To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the\nperception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer\nModule (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities\nand models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we\npropose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across\nboth modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination\nof those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the\nS4, MS3 and AVSS datasets.

Existing methods typically fall into two\ncategories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data\ninefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty\nenforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,\nwhich rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of\nlow-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid\nframework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical\noptimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,\nremoving the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it\nleverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition\nby adaptively generating high-level objectives.

However, existing works are mainly\nrestricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack\nof a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real\nresearch scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation\nbenchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically\nrequire integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of\nexternal tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse\nformats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with\nappropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support\nstandardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent\nexecution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and\nprogrammatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most\nadvanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%\naverage accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,\nhighlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical\nfindings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,\noften invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task.

However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single\nframework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity\nconsistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial\ncontrollability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose\nReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It\nconstitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix\nModule leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic\nfeatures of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT\nbackbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,\npixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address\nthis, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues\nfrom reference images and introduces an {\\epsilon}-equivariant latent space\nthat jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise\nspace. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where\nenvironmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature\nalignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while\npreserving identity.

We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised\npre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face\nimages. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize\nmasked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM\nto encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces.

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision.

Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style\ntransfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables\nprompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while\npreserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we\ndesign a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and\nself-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region\ncontrol mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at\neach denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance\nvisual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier\ntransform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method achieves superior performance in scene text style\ntransformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual\nfidelity and text preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa SceneTextStylizer\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u7531\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f20\u9012\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u63a9\u6a21\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fdd\u7559\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SceneTextStylizer \u5728\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their\nmultimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can\nperturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or\npolicy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial\ntraining and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training\ntypically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high\ncomputational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer\nfrom degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex\nmultimodal tasks.\n  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently\nserves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation.

This is particularly challenging\nbecause the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,\n``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars\ndiffer significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality\nand the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot\nrecognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive\nsurvey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We\nsystematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy\ngrounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit\ndisentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and\ncross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of\nthese methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different\nproblem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL.

In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet\noften overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct\nnumber of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the\ndataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we\nconstruct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary\ndatasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6\nfeaturing complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the\nscaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to\nimprove counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key\nreason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization\nrather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt.

However, existing methods lack the flexibility to\nmodulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual\nand creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with\nmechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by\ninvestigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs\nand find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's\nassociative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers\neffectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations\ncan be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.\nBuilding on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),\na lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior\nin MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate\nrepresentations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects\nhigh-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,\nwhose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with\noutput stability.

This work addresses the limitations of\nAIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and\nimplementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to\nidentify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.\nThe You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and\ncharacterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational\nstatus, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550\ninstances was developed from $5{,}973~\\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River\nimagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification\n(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1\nscore of 95.8\\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1\nscore of 91.6\\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification\nreached an F1 score of 99.4\\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded\n93.8\\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error\n(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically\ndisjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\\%. These\nresults underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite\nsensing with AIS fusion.

To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an\nextensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks\nfollowing the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change\ndescriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the\naction task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages\n11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental\nmodels and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These\nobservations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as\ncategorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to\nsupport understanding of situated changes.

While deep learning models have advanced in network\narchitecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated\ndata. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal\ntasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random\nmixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the\nlack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose\nMS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that\nautomatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key\ncomponents of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)\nstrategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples\nwith contradictory emotions.

We will release our models and the datasets used in the\nevaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:\nhttps://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/Ev4DGS/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Ev4DGS\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5373 RGB \u6216\u7070\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u5bf9\u975e\u521a\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u975e\u521a\u6027\u5bf9\u8c61\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7a00\u758f\u7684 RGB \u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ec5\u4ece\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u56de\u5f52\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7684 3D \u9ad8\u65af Splatting \u8868\u793a\uff1a1) \u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e 2D \u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca 2) \u4ece\u4e8b\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u63a9\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7c97\u7cd9 3D \u53d8\u5f62\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5408\u6210\u548c\u65b0\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5305\u542b\u975e\u521a\u6027\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8868\u660e\uff0cEv4DGS \u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6734\u7d20\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u521a\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5 Ev4DGS\u3002"}}
