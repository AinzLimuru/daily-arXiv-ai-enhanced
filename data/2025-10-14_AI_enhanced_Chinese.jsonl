Using a balanced binary\ndataset (4,000 images), our experiments demonstrate the advantages of thermal\nimaging in inference speed, accuracy, and model size. We achieve up to 100%\naccuracy using lightweight models like VGG19 and NasNetMobile, with thermal\nmodels performing faster and more robustly across different lighting\nconditions. Our system runs on consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4080) and achieves\ninference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its\ndeployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real\nrobot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging\nperforms best.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high\ncomputational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient\ninference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM\nbetween thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches\noften introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for\nthe performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this\nwork, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls\nthe performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In\nparticular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,\nformulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently\ndetermine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,\nusing the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes\nensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our\ncomprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method\ncan save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
