Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化(DPO)框架，采用随机对比采样构建训练对，无需额外训练数据、奖励模型或人工偏好标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充Random DPO后，临床性能指标提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成的准确性，且具有模型无关性，无需额外数据或复杂标注。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态分析方法，通过整合面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和凝视行为来改善自闭症谱系障碍（ASC）的计算机辅助诊断，特别是在凝视特征方面引入了新的统计描述符，将基于凝视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，整体分类准确率达到74%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自闭症计算机辅助诊断方法在凝视特征性能不佳和缺乏现实世界泛化能力方面存在挑战，需要开发更有效的多模态分析方法。

Method: 使用包含168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集，进行多模态分析（面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性、凝视行为），并引入新的统计描述符来量化眼凝视角度的变异性，采用后期融合方法整合不同模态的特征。

Result: 基于凝视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后的整体分类准确率达到74%，验证了多模态行为标记在自闭症筛查中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明基于视频的多模态筛查工具在支持自闭症评估方面具有巨大潜力，能够提供可扩展的筛查解决方案。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过轻量级的训练友好机制选择性保留高价值上下文，解决了VLA模型在长序列推理时的KV内存增长和注意力二次成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在机器人感知和控制方面具有潜力，但其可扩展性受到注意力二次成本和长序列推理时KV内存无限增长的制约。现有方法通过扩展骨干网络改善泛化能力，但忽视了实时部署所需的关键推理效率。

Method: 将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习到的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文。该设计保留最近的细粒度细节，同时积极修剪过时、低相关性的内存，同时保持因果关系。

Result: 理论上，KV-Efficient VLA可实现高达1.21倍的推理加速和36%的KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小。该方法可无缝集成到现有的自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA框架能够在无需修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑的情况下实现可扩展的推理，解决了VLA模型在长序列推理时的内存和效率瓶颈。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中事实错误和位置幻觉，通过合成数据集和多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度的错误检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了其临床转化应用，需要开发有效的错误检测方法。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络来检测报告中的错误发现及其位置。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上展示了方法在发现真实性预测和定位方面的鲁棒性，与基于真实值的验证达到了0.997的一致性相关系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程的临床推理中具有实用价值，能够有效检测最先进报告生成器生成的报告中的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过集成视网膜眼底图像的细粒度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提高了疾病分类准确率，在双类型疾病分类任务中达到94%的准确率，比基线模型提升56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键低级别空间细节方面存在困难，如青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和视网膜色素变性等疾病的诊断。

Method: MDF-MLLM将U-Net编码器四层的跳跃特征集成到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，通过补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制来融合视觉特征。

Result: 基线MLLM在双类型疾病分类任务中准确率为60%，而MDF-MLLM达到94%的准确率，提升了56%。召回率和F1分数分别提高了67%和35%。消融研究证实多深度融合方法显著提升了空间推理和分类能力。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为眼底图像分类提供了一个可泛化、可解释和模块化的框架，通过多尺度特征融合优于传统MLLM基线，有望在临床决策支持系统中实际部署。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，利用图像模态分离原始不安全提示的有害语义组件，通过LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示，绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，图像输入中的潜在漏洞未被充分探索，且文本方法在绕过模型安全过滤器方面面临挑战。

Method: 1) LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示；2) LLM将有害提示重写为自然对抗提示以绕过安全过滤器；3) 视觉语言模型生成图像描述，指导LLM迭代重写和优化生成内容。

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了T2I模型在多模态输入下的安全漏洞，为防御此类攻击提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过联合利用显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务的多任务学习方法，来提高显著目标检测的完整性和边界准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前显著目标检测中存在的预测不完整和边界不准确的问题，这些问题源于目标内部复杂性和卷积池化操作中的步长影响。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，将显著目标检测与前景轮廓检测任务交织进行，同时让前景轮廓和边缘检测任务相互指导；开发了新颖的相互学习模块(MLM)，包含多个在相互学习方式下训练的网络分支。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测方面都取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 通过多任务学习和相互学习模块，提出的方法能够生成更完整、边界更准确的显著图，在显著目标检测和边缘检测任务上都表现出色。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MAJORScore，一种用于评估多模态（N≥3）相关性的新指标，通过多模态联合表示实现公平的相关性评分


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标仅适用于两种模态的相关性分析，限制了多模态相似性评估，需要能够处理三个及以上模态相关性的新方法

Method: 利用多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到同一潜在空间中，在同一尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平相关性评分提供支持

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上提升26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低13.28%-20.54%，相比现有方法表现更优

Conclusion: MAJORScore可作为大规模多模态数据集相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估的更可靠指标

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities (N modalities, N>=3) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

### [9] [Safety Assessment of Scaffolding on Construction Site using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21368)
*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于AI的云平台，通过点云数据分析自动检测脚手架结构修改，提高检查准确性和安全性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工目视检查，耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性

Method: 开发云基AI平台，处理脚手架点云数据，通过对比认证参考数据和最新点云数据来检测结构修改

Result: 提出的系统能够自动监测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查时间和精力

Conclusion: AI和数字化技术能够显著提升脚手架安全检查的效率和准确性，有助于改善施工现场安全

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动提示工程框架，用于生成反事实尺寸的图像（如小海象配大按钮），通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器来优化提示，构建了首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中细粒度可控性的挑战，特别是反事实可控性（生成违背常识模式的图像），这对于创造性和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 开发了三组件框架：图像评估器指导数据集构建，监督提示重写器生成修订提示，DPO训练的排序器选择最佳修订提示。扩展了Grounded SAM以改进图像评估器。

Result: 图像评估器性能比其骨干网络提高了114%，实验表明该方法优于最先进的基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在反事实尺寸生成方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构（O-Net和Theta-Net）在非荧光相位调制显微镜中实现超分辨率成像的性能，发现它们在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决光学显微镜横向分辨率限制（约200nm）的问题，避免使用昂贵的外部模块或特殊技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种先前开发的深度神经网络架构（O-Net和Theta-Net），在通过原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试目标上进行评估，比较它们在Zernike相衬和微分干涉相衬显微镜图像中的超分辨率性能。

Result: 两种网络在不同信噪比条件下表现互补：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型，即使使用相同的训练数据和训练周期。

Conclusion: 模型架构与源图像信噪比的结合对深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能至关重要，选择合适的架构可以显著影响超分辨率图像的质量。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和Transformer机制动态融合视听信息，在音频-视觉导航任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视听融合导航中往往忽略更深层次的感知上下文，需要更有效地利用多模态线索来指导导航。

Method: 使用多目标架构结合精炼的Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上的实验表明，DMTF-AVN在成功率(SR)、路径效率(SPL)和场景适应性(SNA)方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的先进多模态融合策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统概念标注促进一对一概念-神经元映射，显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘所需的超参数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然减少了神经元多义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程进行概念遗忘。

Method: 引入SAEmnesia方法，通过系统概念标注促进一对一概念-神经元映射，缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，仅引入交叉熵计算的计算开销。

Result: 在UnlearnCanvas基准上比现有技术提升9.22%；推理时超参数搜索减少96.67%；在9对象移除的序列遗忘任务中，遗忘准确率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元，显著提高了概念遗忘的效率和准确性，特别是在序列遗忘任务中表现出优越的可扩展性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

### [15] [The LongiMam model for improved breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal mammograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21383)
*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，通过整合当前和最多四个先前的乳腺X光片，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络来捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式，在真实世界不平衡数据中显著提升了乳腺癌预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限的先前乳腺X光片，缺乏对真实世界环境中不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。需要开发能够充分利用纵向成像数据的稳健模型来支持风险适应的乳腺癌筛查。

Method: 开发了LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，整合当前和最多四个先前的乳腺X光片，捕捉空间和时间模式。使用具有典型临床筛查中不成比例病例对照比的大规模人群筛查数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多个不同先前检查数量和组成的场景中，LongiMam在包含先前乳腺X光片时始终改善预测性能。先前和当前访问的组合优于单次访问模型，而仅使用先前访问表现较差，突显了结合历史和近期信息的重要性。在关键风险群体（包括致密乳房女性和55岁及以上女性）中均证实了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来改进风险分层。LongiMam作为开源软件公开发布。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

*Laurent Mertens,Elahe' Yargholi,Laura Van Hove,Hans Op de Beeck,Jan Van den Stock,Joost Vennekens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了卷积神经网络（CNNs）在复杂社会认知任务（如图像情感评估）中与人类大脑处理过程的对应关系，发现CNNs难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶大脑处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CNNs与人类大脑在复杂社会认知任务中的对应关系，超越一般视觉感知的研究范围。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估CNN架构与人类行为和fMRI数据的对齐程度，并开发Object2Brain框架结合GradCAM和对象检测来研究不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。

Result: CNNs在图像情感评估任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，不同CNN架构显示出不同的对象类别敏感性。

Conclusion: 对于复杂的社会认知任务，CNNs与人类大脑处理过程的对应关系有限，无法充分反映高阶认知处理。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架用于概念瓶颈模型，通过移除和重训练两步流程，将概念级用户反馈转化为样本级辅助标签，减少模型对不良概念的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型的干预方法无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差问题，比如模型从有偏数据中学习捷径。

Method: 采用两步流程：移除步骤中专家识别并移除不良概念；重训练步骤中提出CBDebug方法，将概念级反馈转化为样本级标签，应用监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构和基准测试中显著优于先前的重训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题，提升了模型与专家推理的对齐度。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Motivation: 沉船是海上历史的重要标记，但通过人工检查测深数据来发现沉船耗时且需要专家分析，因此需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 开发了基于深度学习的开源工具，包括数据预处理、深度学习推理、模型输出阈值处理，可生成像素级分割掩码或边界框。使用来自五大湖和爱尔兰海岸的沉船数据进行训练，并采用合成数据生成增加数据集规模和多样性。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的开源解决方案，能够自动检测沉船，显著提高了沉船发现的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝如何影响神经网络的可解释性，发现轻度到中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，而过度剪枝会合并异质特征，降低概念一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明神经网络可以在保持性能的同时大幅剪枝，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响仍不清楚。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下的Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients解释方法，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT概念提取跟踪学习概念的语义连贯性变化。

Result: 轻度到中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留了清晰、语义上有意义的概念；而激进剪枝合并了异质特征，降低了显著性图稀疏性和概念连贯性，尽管仍保持准确性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以使内部表示更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个仅使用多视角图像输入，无需真实相机位姿或深度监督，就能联合进行室内布局估计和3D物体检测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖点云输入，但大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，视觉数据更为普遍。需要解决仅使用图像进行室内场景理解的挑战。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，采用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，利用新颖的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中实现了最先进的性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用有姿态图像，(iii)使用无姿态图像。

Conclusion: TUN3D在保持与专用3D物体检测方法相当性能的同时，显著推进了布局估计，为整体室内场景理解设立了新基准。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该系统通过精细的语义粒度划分和轻量级部署策略，成功提升了图像传输的效率和重建质量，为生成式语义通信提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Result: 框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等实际任务中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间提供了理论严谨的层次形状简化方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率较低（12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的实用性，需要更高分辨率的气候预测数据。

Method: 在观测网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指标来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 在日平均温度上的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标的误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提高气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候信息。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于图像的越狱攻击的实际挑战，以及为VLMs开发高效防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集（如CIFAR-100、Imagenette）上的实验表明，DyME始终优于现有最先进方法，实现了更高的多概念擦除保真度，同时最小化了对非目标内容的附带损害。

Conclusion: DyME通过动态模块化设计和正交性约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的适配器干扰问题，为实际应用中的按需概念擦除提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

### [29] [VideoJudge: Bootstrapping Enables Scalable Supervision of MLLM-as-a-Judge for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21451)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的多模态大语言模型，通过生成器-评估器交互训练，在多个基准测试中优于更大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标无法准确反映人类判断，人工评估成本高昂，而现有LLM评估器在视频理解领域的应用相对不足。

Method: 使用生成器-评估器交互训练方法：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃。

Result: VideoJudge-7B在四个元评估基准中的三个上优于更大的基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B），证明视频输入对视频理解任务评估至关重要。

Conclusion: VideoJudge作为专门的MLLM评估器在视频理解评估中表现优异，视频输入对评估效果至关重要，长链推理并不能改善性能。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp，在保持精度的同时实现273-1365倍压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来减少传输负载。

Method: 使用简单的瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后采用多阶段残差向量量化(RVQ)，仅传输每个像素的码本索引来大幅减少传输数据量。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X数据集上，ReVQom实现了273倍(30 bpp)到1365倍(6 bpp)的压缩，在18 bpp时性能与原始特征相当或更优，在6-12 bpp时仍能保持可接受的性能。

Conclusion: ReVQom实现了高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为实际V2X部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业形象时存在的性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，发现这些模型普遍存在强烈的性别失衡和文化误读问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业形象时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，揭示AI模型中的社会偏见问题。

Method: 使用ImageFX、DALL-E V3和Grok三种模型生成1,006张沙特56种职业的图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估，第三方资深研究员裁决分歧，共获得10,100个判断。

Result: 所有模型都显示出强烈的性别失衡：ImageFX输出85%为男性，Grok 86.6%为男性，DALL-E V3 96%为男性，其中DALL-E V3性别刻板印象最严重。领导和技术角色中的性别失衡尤为明显，所有模型都频繁出现服装、场景和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型反映了训练数据中嵌入的社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别呈现有限。需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和更具文化敏感性的评估框架来确保公平和真实的视觉输出。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理增强的多模态大语言模型预训练范式，用于统一的不当内容检测，通过三个针对性预训练任务解决短视频内容与原始预训练数据的分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台快速发展，不当内容识别日益重要。现有方法通常为每种问题类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个针对性预训练任务：(1) Caption任务增强模型对视频细节的感知；(2) 视觉问答任务加深对问题定义和标注指南的理解；(3) 思维链任务增强模型的推理能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该预训练方法显著提高了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，且预训练模型对未见过的突发问题表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该推理增强的MLLM预训练范式有效解决了短视频不当内容检测中的分布差异和复杂问题定义挑战，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 本文提出GUI-Cursor方法，将GUI定位重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过多步强化学习训练模型移动光标来定位UI元素，在ScreenSpot数据集上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI定位方法将坐标预测视为数值坐标生成任务，但现有视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率GUI图像时难以准确预测数值坐标。

Method: 将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务：模型生成动作移动光标，基于目标对象、空间关系和移动历史逐步接近目标，使用多步在线强化学习和基于轨迹的奖励函数训练。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的GUI-Cursor在ScreenSpot-v2上从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，95%的实例在两步内解决问题。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，GUI-Cursor能够自适应调整步数，在复杂GUI定位任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个问题：低质量文本-视频数据对会影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性。

Method: 在现有基准上增加视频标注以支持语义理解和减少数据偏差；设计检索思维链，通过成对比较步骤生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT在实证中提高了检索性能，产生详细推理依据，并促进模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的检索方法解决了传统嵌入模型的局限性，为模型评估和数据检查提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但人工检查容易出错，现有的基于自然/工业图像的自动检测方法在手术领域迁移效果不佳，存在误报、对小缺陷不敏感和领域偏移问题。

Method: 整合背景掩蔽、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应技术，专门针对手术器械调整无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法能够可靠地检测手术器械图像中的细粒度缺陷，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过针对性的技术整合，成功解决了手术器械缺陷检测中的关键挑战，实现了可靠的缺陷检测能力。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的替代方案来改进扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出LSEP（线性可分性）正则化，将线性探测直接融入网络学习动态，而非仅作为后评估工具，无需辅助编码器和对齐操作。

Result: 在基于流的transformer架构（如SiT）上，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上实现了1.46的FID分数，显著提升了训练效率和生成质量。

Conclusion: LSEP方法提供了一种无需外部编码器的有效正则化策略，成功将线性探测融入训练过程，改善了扩散模型的表示学习和生成性能。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在图像地理定位中忽视了地理空间中的空间依赖性，导致无法有效处理假阴性（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本）和难负样本（视觉相似但地理距离远）的问题。

Method: 提出空间正则化对比学习策略，使用半变异函数建模特征空间距离与地理距离的关系，捕获空间相关性，并以此识别难负样本和假阴性。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上的评估表明，该方法显著提升了图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度上的表现。

Conclusion: 显式建模空间先验能够有效改善基于图像的地理定位性能，特别是在处理空间依赖性和区分相似但地理位置不同的图像方面。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

Motivation: 解决从单张图像预测物体运动的问题，现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面表现不佳，特别是涉及简单物理场景时。

Method: 将任务构建为条件生成密集轨迹网格，采用现代视频生成器架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，直接建模运动而非生成像素。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地解决了从单张图像预测运动的问题，揭示了当前视频生成器在物理运动预测方面的局限性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的性能差异，为选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类精度、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（Silhouette得分0.31 vs 0.21）和区分能力（6.16倍分离比）上更优，特别擅长姿态识别；V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更一致，性能方差更低（0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别，但在运动依赖动作上表现下降；V-JEPA2的时间建模提供跨动作类别的均衡表示质量。应根据任务需求和可靠性约束选择合适的架构。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Method: 采用双架构方法：基于ResNet50的CNN-LSTM模型处理卫星图像，Vision Transformer模型处理无人机图像，并结合ConceptNet和WordNet的外部语义知识扩展词汇覆盖。

Result: VLCE在InfoMetIC指标上达到最高95.33%，显著优于LLaVA和QwenVL等基线模型，同时保持了有竞争力的语义对齐性能。

Conclusion: 双架构系统展示了通过自动化生成信息密集的描述来改进灾害损害评估的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一个基于多维度相似性度量的框架来分析不同视觉模型家族的表征特性，发现几何结构和单元调谐携带家族特异性特征，而线性可解码信息更普遍共享。通过相似性网络融合方法实现了更好的家族区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表征特性是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用一套表征相似性度量（几何、单元调谐、线性可解码性），并采用相似性网络融合（SNF）方法整合这些互补维度。

Result: 几何和调谐度量能强区分模型家族，而线性预测性度量区分较弱。SNF融合后实现了显著更强的家族分离，发现监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，而所有自监督模型跨架构边界聚集。

Conclusion: 这个生物学启发的框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类学，表明由架构和训练目标共同塑造的新兴计算策略定义了超越表面设计类别的表征结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过为冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在表示和隐式3D场，实现3D感知的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，在空间一致性和下游3D推理任务应用方面存在限制。高质量3D世界模型对于具身智能和通用人工智能至关重要。

Method: 引入跨分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，通过统一主干和跨分支信息交换实现联合建模。

Result: 实验表明FantasyWorld在多个视点一致性和风格一致性方面优于最近的几何一致性基线，有效桥接了视频想象和3D感知。

Conclusion: 该方法产生的几何分支潜在表示可作为下游3D任务（如新视角合成和导航）的通用表示，无需逐场景优化或微调。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程。它能处理不同维度(1D-3D)、分辨率和物理场的异构时空数据，通过组件卷积、跨场注意力等机制实现高效建模，在多个下游任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决科学机器学习中处理异构时空数据的挑战，包括不同维度、分辨率、物理场类型的数据，需要一个灵活且强大的基础模型来统一处理这些复杂场景。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积处理标量和矢量通道，跨场注意力建模不同物理场间信息传播，轴注意力分解时空自注意力以降低计算负担。

Result: 在多个异构PDE数据集上预训练后，通过微调和LoRA适配器，MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化中均优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越现有先进模型。

Conclusion: MORPH提供了一个灵活强大的基础架构，能够从科学观测的异构多模态数据中学习，为可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习开辟了新路径。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出MS-YOLO模型，通过使用MobileNetV4主干网络和SlideLoss损失函数，在红外图像目标检测中实现高精度和低计算成本的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外成像在低光照和恶劣天气条件下具有优势，但存在类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制等问题，需要开发高效准确的检测模型。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet主干网络降低计算量，并提出SlideLoss损失函数动态关注欠代表和遮挡样本。

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2数据集上，MS-YOLO仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，达到竞争性的mAP和优越的精度，计算开销降低1.5%。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了保持高检测质量同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

TL;DR: MATR通过显式预测目标运动来更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BDD100k数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DETR-based多目标跟踪框架在单个Transformer解码器层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致冲突和关联精度下降。

Method: 提出运动感知Transformer(MATR)，显式预测目标在帧间的运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞。

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升超过9点，达到71.3；SportsMOT上72.2 HOTA；BDD100k上54.7 mTETA和41.6 mHOTA，均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是推进多目标跟踪的简单而高效的方法。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏置直接注入网络注意力分数中，实现几何一致的视频去雨处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中常见的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态轻微变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界李相对偏置，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧间的角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性的表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏置实现了高效且鲁棒的视频去雨。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到自然图像领域大规模基础模型成功的启发，希望将这种技术应用于SAR领域，以解决SAR目标识别任务中标注数据有限、分布偏移鲁棒性和特征可迁移性等问题。

Method: 首先测试现有最强大的视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR数据上的表现，然后使用SAR数据对公开可用的SSL模型进行自监督微调，训练AFRL-DINOv2模型。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型显著优于当前最好的SAR领域模型SARATR-X，建立了SAR基础模型的新最先进水平。实验还分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应方法的性能权衡。

Conclusion: 自监督微调是SAR基础模型发展的可行路径，尽管取得了积极成果，但SAR基础模型的构建仍有很长的路要走。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以实现可扩展的UI测试和智能UI代理开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供了实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation
network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的新框架，用于改进群体级情感识别（GER）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，并且忽视了情感标签语义信息对完整理解情感的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（利用多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（利用群体级情感标签提示大语言模型生成细致情感词典，并通过结构化情感树精炼为完整语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过有效整合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息，显著提升了群体级情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 直接应用SAM模型到医学图像分割面临三个主要挑战：边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足以及缺乏不确定性量化，这些限制了其在临床高风险场景中的应用。

Method: KG-SAM整合了三个关键组件：(1)医学知识图谱编码细粒度解剖关系；(2)基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测；(3)不确定性感知融合模块提升临床可靠性。

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验显示，KG-SAM在前列腺分割中平均Dice得分为82.69%，在腹部分割中MRI达到78.05%、CT达到79.68%，表现显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个鲁棒且可推广的医学图像分割框架，能够有效整合解剖学知识提升分割性能。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型启发，现有视觉模型需要跨模态和源的任务特定预训练，成本高且难以扩展到未见任务。探索预训练视频生成模型能否适应多样图像和视频任务。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，微调视频扩散变换器，将任务表示为视觉句子，上下文序列定义任务和输出模态。支持跨模态推理和跨源任务。

Result: 尽管仅使用自然视频数据训练，UniVid在跨模态和跨源任务上表现良好。通过反转视觉句子顺序可轻松切换理解和生成任务。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为可扩展和统一的视觉建模基础，展示了在统一框架下处理多样视觉任务的可能性。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

Result: 在空间和非空间架构上均取得最先进结果：在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速，COCO数据集上仅下降0.7% mIOU；在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速，ImageNet上top-1准确率无下降。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，既保持了空间完整性，又实现了显著的加速效果，在离线和微调场景下均表现优异。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

TL;DR: GASP-ICL是一个无需训练的多模态深度伪造检测框架，通过引导式自适应评分和传播上下文学习，增强大型视觉语言模型在跨模态伪造检测中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面表现出色，但在多模态深度伪造检测中存在挑战：难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索。

Method: 提出GASP-ICL框架，使用MDD适配的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对构建候选集，设计图结构泰勒自适应评分器（GSTAS）捕获跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号，生成判别性示例。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过精确选择语义对齐、任务相关的演示示例，增强了LVLMs在多模态深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性，为无需训练的多模态伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效从多动作场景中分离指定动作，提升动作识别性能

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for

Conclusion: MIRG-RL通过统一的强化学习框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，提出的数据构建方法和双重奖励策略显著提升了跨图像推理能力。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Motivation: 当前视频生成方法在长时程生成中存在困难：扩散方法存在时间不一致性和视觉漂移，自回归方法则牺牲视觉细节。需要一种能够稳定生成高质量长视频的方法。

Method: 提出混合框架LongScape，结合了块内扩散去噪和块间自回归因果生成。核心创新是动作引导的可变长度分块机制，以及上下文感知专家混合框架(CMoE)。

Conclusion: LongScape通过混合方法和创新的分块机制，成功解决了长时程视频生成的稳定性问题，为高质量具身操作数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: MoWM通过融合混合世界模型的表示，有效解决了具身动作规划中的视觉冗余和细粒度细节缺失问题，为具身规划的未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专门为U-Net设计，无法充分利用DiT的优越性能。

Method: 使用LLM将用户提示转换为前景和背景提示，分别指导视频生成；分析3D全注意力机制，提出STD-RoPE通过修改前景token的位置嵌入消除跨帧空间差异。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT-based视频生成提供了简单有效的训练free轨迹控制解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要关注静态场景，但现实世界场景经常包含动态元素（如移动物体、变化光照等），这带来了更复杂的挑战。需要同时建模时间辐射变化和LDR到HDR的复杂3D转换。

Method: 提出了HDR-4DGS，一种基于高斯泼溅的架构，具有创新的动态色调映射模块，该模块根据时间维度上不断变化的辐射分布动态调整色调映射函数，从而明确连接HDR和LDR域。

Result: HDR-4DGS实现了时间辐射一致性和空间精确的颜色转换，能够从任意视角和时间实例生成逼真的HDR渲染。在定量性能和视觉保真度方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了动态场景中的HDR新视角合成问题，通过动态色调映射实现了辐射一致性和准确的颜色转换，为现实世界动态场景的HDR建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像生成模型的普及引发了对其滥用的担忧，但当前检测方法主要依赖过时的"真实"图像数据集，忽视了现代摄影技术中神经网络处理图像的现实。

Method: 通过分析当前图像检测研究现状，指出ImageNet等传统数据集已无法代表现代"真实"图像，因为90%以上照片由智能手机拍摄，其图像形成算法与生成器类似。

Result: 发现当前和以往研究过度关注生成算法和"假"样本，缺乏对"真实"图像的明确定义和数据收集，导致检测方法评估存在根本缺陷。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考"真实"图像概念，建立清晰的技术定义和新的基准数据集，甚至质疑检测"假"图像是否是一个合理的研究目标。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像美学评估方面具有潜力，但由于缺乏多模态美学推理数据和美学判断的主观性，难以生成准确且可解释的美学判断。

Method: 提出Aes-R1框架：1) 使用AesCoT管道构建和过滤高质量思维链美学推理数据；2) 训练模型在评分前生成结构化解释；3) 采用RAPO强化学习算法联合优化绝对评分回归和相对排序。

Result: Aes-R1将骨干模型的平均PLCC/SRCC分别提升了47.9%/34.8%，在相似规模下超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了其在有限监督和分布外场景下的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: Aes-R1使多模态大语言模型能够生成有依据的解释和可信的评分，在一个统一框架中增强了美学评分和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: 基于Stable-Diffusion骨干网络，开发了唇部习惯调制机制，联合建模音素级视听同步和说话者特定的口面部动态；引入遮挡感知训练策略，在修复过程中显式暴露遮挡物体；采用混合Mamba-Transformer架构优化训练效率。

Result: 实验结果表明StableDub在唇部习惯相似性和遮挡鲁棒性方面表现优异，在音频-唇部同步、视频质量和分辨率一致性方面超越其他方法。

Conclusion: StableDub消除了先前方法对成本密集型先验的需求，在计算密集的扩散模型骨干上展现出优越的训练效率，扩展了视觉配音方法的适用性。

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

TL;DR: Drag4D是一个交互式框架，通过文本驱动的3D场景生成集成物体运动控制，允许用户为3D对象定义轨迹并集成到高质量3D背景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以实现用户对3D场景中物体运动的精确控制，需要开发能够交互式定义3D轨迹并确保时空一致性的框架。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用2D高斯泼溅和全景图像增强文本到3D背景生成；2) 3D复制粘贴方法提取物体网格并物理感知定位；3) 基于部分增强运动条件视频扩散模型进行时间动画。

Result: 实现了用户控制物体在高质量3D背景中的协调运动，展示了每个阶段和最终结果的有效性。

Conclusion: Drag4D提供了一个统一的架构，能够实现用户控制的物体运动与高质量3D背景的协调对齐。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导技术，实现了与音频输入精确同步的高质量视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频骨干网络，引入两个关键组件：运动感知损失（强调高运动区域学习）和音频同步引导（使用视觉对齐的非同步模型引导全模型，在推理时更好地利用音频线索）。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法，能够生成380x640分辨率、24fps的同步视频。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的运动感知损失和音频同步引导机制，成功实现了音频与视频的精细同步，为时序控制的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的语言引导变化检测模型(LG-CD)，利用自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，显著提高了变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基于深度学习的方法主要关注学习单模态视觉信息，而忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型(SAM2)作为特征提取器捕获双时相遥感图像的多尺度金字塔特征，采用多层适配器微调模型，设计文本融合注意力模块(TFAM)对齐视觉和文本信息，并实现视觉-语义融合解码器(V-SFD)深度整合视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在三个数据集(LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD)上的实验表明，LG-CD始终优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多模态信息为实现广义变化检测提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的扩散模型框架，结合文本和拖拽交互进行图像编辑，解决了现有方法在空间控制和纹理操作方面的互补局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本驱动编辑方法擅长纹理操作但缺乏精确空间控制，而拖拽驱动方法主要修改形状结构但缺乏细粒度纹理指导，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：1）点云确定性拖拽，通过3D特征映射增强潜在空间布局控制；2）拖拽-文本引导去噪，在去噪过程中动态平衡拖拽和文本条件的影响。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅实现了高保真的联合编辑，而且在纯文本或纯拖拽设置下也达到或超越了专门方法的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个通用且可泛化的可控图像操作解决方案，支持灵活的编辑模式（纯文本、纯拖拽或组合条件）。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Motivation: 北欧地区无人机图像中的车辆检测面临强可见性挑战和雪覆盖引起的域偏移问题，标注数据昂贵但无标注数据获取成本较低。

Method: 提出sideload-CL-adaptation框架：在预训练阶段通过对比学习训练CNN表示提取器，在微调阶段将其侧载到冻结的YOLO11n骨干网络中，比较了多种融合方法和粒度。

Result: 在NVD数据集上，提出的sideload-CL-adaptation模型在mAP50指标上提升了3.8%到9.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用无标注数据提升了车辆检测性能，特别适用于北欧雪地环境下的无人机图像分析。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法要么需要特定模型的反演设计，要么需要大量优化，无法充分利用最新的图像到视频模型将图像编辑能力迁移到视频领域。

Method: 提出向量场校正与样本偏差来绕过反演，引入偏差项到去噪向量场；使用结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知的时间相关噪声；采用偏差缓存机制最小化计算成本。

Result: 评估显示该方法在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有方法，提供轻量级的即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: IF-V2V实现了高质量的视频编辑，无需反演过程，为视觉创意提供了高效的工具。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法主要依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据，这限制了实际应用。作者希望开发一种自监督学习框架来减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 使用神经体渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过可微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关的外观。该方法可以无缝集成到现有框架中。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中，SSLCounter不仅实现了最先进的性能，而且在仅使用70%训练数据时仍能提供竞争性表现，显示出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习和神经体渲染成功解决了多视角计数对标注数据的依赖问题，在保持高性能的同时显著提高了数据效率。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统性的基准测试，用于评估基础模型中的物体中心空间推理能力，发现检测器和视觉语言模型在空间定位与关系推理之间存在稳定权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试强调定位精度，但忽略了模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系。有效的场景理解不仅需要识别物体，还需要推理它们的相对位置、分组和深度关系。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大型视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 检测器（如GroundingDINO和OWLv2）能提供精确的边界框但关系推理能力有限，而视觉语言模型（如SmolVLM和GPT-4o）能提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述，但在细粒度空间上下文理解上存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位能力与真正空间理解之间的差距，指出社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文对来缓解视觉上下文学习中对单个上下文对过度依赖的问题，提高预测的稳定性和减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)通常过度依赖单个上下文对，导致预测存在偏差和不稳定性，需要解决这一问题。

Method: 提出基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)，通过平滑多个上下文对之间的分配分数来减少偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种任务上的实验表明，PANICL相比强基线方法有持续改进，对领域偏移表现出强鲁棒性，并能很好地泛化到其他VICL模型。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且广泛适用的框架，能够有效解决VICL中的过度依赖问题，提高模型的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一个轻量级的6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB参考图像，无需深度传感器、多视图图像采集或训练视图合成模型，在资源受限环境下仍能保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法存在实际限制：许多方法依赖传感器深度，在透明或高反光表面条件下会失败；RGB解决方案在低光和纹理缺失场景中由于缺乏几何信息而匹配性能较差。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：1) 基于token-scaler的微调机制和新的优化损失，在Depth-Anything v2基础上提升深度预测精度；2) 深度感知匹配过程，在LoFTR中有效整合空间关系，处理挑战性材料和光照条件的匹配。

Result: 在REAL275深度预测上相比Depth-Anything v2（微调头）提升14.41%（δ₁.₀₅）；在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计评估显示，平均召回率提升6.1%，超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: SingRef6D通过创新的深度预测增强和深度感知匹配，在仅使用单张RGB参考图像的情况下，显著提升了6D姿态估计的性能，特别是在挑战性表面和光照条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Motivation: 现有的基础模型（特别是transformer解码器）存在计算开销高和缺乏可解释性的问题，限制了在资源受限场景中的部署。

Method: 提出可训练的硬特征选择器进行稀疏操作，并将特征选择集成到提前退出机制中，使用贝叶斯优化确定最优退出阈值。

Conclusion: DynaNav框架有效解决了视觉导航中的计算效率问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了资源消耗。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across

TL;DR: 提出SemanticControl方法，解决ControlNet在视觉条件与文本提示不对齐时的性能下降问题，通过自适应抑制冲突区域的视觉条件影响，增强文本指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet依赖与生成目标精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实际应用中，特别是对于不常见或想象性场景，很难获得完美对齐的视觉条件。现有方法无法有效利用语义相关但不对齐的视觉条件。

Method: 提出训练无关的SemanticControl方法：首先使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示进行辅助去噪过程，提取信息性注意力掩码；然后在实际目标提示的去噪过程中利用这些掩码来抑制冲突区域的视觉条件影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在深度图、边缘图和人体骨架等各种松散对齐条件下都能提升性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl能够有效利用语义相关但不对齐的视觉条件，在保持文本忠实度的同时改善生成质量。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Motivation: 现有基于上下文学习的方法存在严重的属性泄漏问题，损害主体保真度，且无法与人类偏好对齐。

Method: 1) 引入显式位置监督分离不同主体的注意力区域；2) 使用专家混合架构增强模型能力；3) 设计在线强化学习框架对齐人类偏好。

Result: 实验验证该框架显著提高了主体保真度，并更好地与人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: MultiCrafter通过位置监督、MoE架构和强化学习，有效解决了多主体图像生成中的属性泄漏和偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

TL;DR: PartSAM是首个基于大规模3D数据训练的可提示部件分割模型，采用三平面双分支编码器架构，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放世界部件分割方法通常从2D基础模型（如SAM）迁移监督，通过将多视角掩码提升到3D来实现。但这种间接范式无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解、不受控分解和有限泛化能力的问题。

Method: PartSAM采用编码器-解码器架构，其中基于三平面的双分支编码器产生空间结构化token用于可扩展的部件感知表示学习。还引入了模型在环标注流程，从在线资源中筛选出超过500万个3D形状-部件对，提供多样化和细粒度的标签。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型迈出的决定性一步，其可扩展架构和多样化3D数据的结合产生了新兴的开放世界能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了基于深度学习的无参考图像对比度质量评估框架，通过定制和微调EfficientNet B0、ResNet18和MobileNetV2预训练架构，在CID2013和CCID2014数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像对比度是视觉感知的基本因素，对整体图像质量至关重要。然而，大多数无参考图像质量评估模型难以准确评估不同真实世界条件下的对比度失真。

Method: 定制并微调三个预训练架构（EfficientNet B0、ResNet18和MobileNetV2），使用对比度感知回归头，在包含合成和真实对比度失真的基准数据集上进行端到端训练，并采用针对性的数据增强。

Result: 定制化的EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014上达到PLCC=0.9286和SRCC=0.9178，在CID2013上达到PLCC=0.9581和SRCC=0.9369，超越了传统方法和其他深度基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法表明，对轻量级预训练网络进行对比度感知适应可以产生高性能、可扩展的无参考对比度质量评估解决方案，适用于实时和资源受限的应用。

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

TL;DR: Geo-R1是一个面向少样本地理空间指代表达理解的推理中心强化微调范式，通过先生成显式推理链分解指代表达，再利用这些推理来定位目标对象，在数据稀缺场景下显著优于监督微调基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像中指代表达理解在数据稀缺场景下泛化能力差的问题，传统监督微调方法需要大量标注数据但在少样本情况下表现不佳。

Method: 提出推理中心强化微调(RFT)范式，采用"先推理后行动"的过程：先生成显式、可解释的推理链来分解指代表达，然后利用这些推理来定位目标对象。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1始终大幅优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的方法有效利用了有限标注数据，提升了模型泛化能力和可解释性，为数据稀缺场景下的地理空间指代表达理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型在医疗视觉问答中的临床谄媚行为，提出了一个医学谄媚数据集基准，并开发了VIPER缓解策略来过滤非证据内容，生成基于证据的回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在临床工作流程中日益普及，但它们经常表现出谄媚行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而非基于证据的推理。

Method: 构建基于PathVQA、SLAKE和VQA-RAD的医学谄媚数据集，使用心理学动机的压力模板进行对抗性实验，并提出VIPER缓解策略来过滤非证据内容。

Result: 发现各种VLM模型普遍脆弱，表现出显著的对抗性响应变化，模仿和专家提供的纠正是最有效的触发因素。VIPER框架平均减少了谄媚行为，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该基准分析和缓解框架为医疗VLM在真实世界临床交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础，强调了对证据锚定防御的需求。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一种利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理模糊的注视模式和复杂时空关系来改善智能眼镜场景下的多模态查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户注意力被整合到视觉语言模型中，但注视数据建模存在模糊性挑战：用户口头问题使用代词或跳过上下文变得模糊，人类注视模式嘈杂且与口语问题呈现复杂时空关系。

Method: 首先分析注视模态的查询样本，利用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成管道生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程处理嘈杂注视模式，设计热图模块将注视信息整合到先进VLMs中同时保留预训练知识。

Result: 在保留测试集上的实验表明，GLARIFY显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将VLMs与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手的可用和直观交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型存在空间偏见问题，当相同视觉信息出现在图像不同位置时会产生不一致的输出，这源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。作者提出了平衡位置分配机制来解决这一问题。

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中取得了显著成功，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分理解。本研究旨在系统性地探究LVLMs的空间偏见问题。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析模型响应，发现空间不一致性问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出了平衡位置分配机制，为所有图像token分配相同的位置嵌入。

Result: 实验表明BaPA机制无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，与轻量级微调结合还能进一步提升在多种多模态基准测试中的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA能产生更平衡的注意力机制。

Conclusion: LVLMs存在显著的空间偏见问题，这源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。BaPA机制能有效缓解这一问题，促进更平衡的视觉信息整合和更全面的视觉理解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Motivation: 扩散模型骨干网络既包含语义特征也包含视觉特征，但缺乏标注数据集使得分离这些视觉特征具有挑战性。

Method: 设计自动化流程构建具有标注语义和视觉对应关系的图像对，并采用对比架构分离两种特征类型。

Result: 该方法在量化视觉不一致性方面优于CLIP、DINO等全局特征方法，并能定位不一致区域。

Conclusion: 这是首个支持主题驱动生成中不一致性量化和定位的方法，为该任务的进展提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like

prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时产生大量计算开销，而基于"图像思维"的模型需要在视觉领域进行推理，这促使开发更高效的处理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段推理管道：第一阶段分析下采样图像识别相关区域；第二阶段仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理。通过强化学习框架中的奖励组件实现推理驱动的感知。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率，同时效率更高。例如在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉token，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法有效解决了高分辨率图像处理的计算效率问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了处理效率。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型深度聚焦方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，特别是在细纹理或深度突变区域，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出DualFocus框架，利用焦点堆栈的梯度模式，引入具有双约束的变分公式：空间约束利用梯度模式变化区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影，焦距约束强制单峰单调的焦点概率与物理焦点行为对齐。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度精度和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过结合空间和焦距约束，显著提高了深度聚焦在挑战性区域的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to

TL;DR: FailureAtlas是一个主动探索文本到图像模型失败案例的框架，通过结构化搜索方法发现了超过24.7万个未知错误切片，并揭示了这些失败与训练数据稀缺的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态基准测试在比较文本到图像模型时诊断能力有限，难以发现系统性失败的全貌或隔离根本原因，需要一种主动探索的补充范式。

Method: 将错误发现构建为对最小化、诱导失败概念的结构化搜索问题，采用新颖的加速技术使计算密集型问题变得可处理。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion模型上应用该方法，发现了大量先前未知的错误切片（仅SD1.5就超过247,000个），并首次提供了大规模证据表明这些失败与训练数据稀缺相关。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas通过提供原则化和可扩展的深度模型审计引擎，建立了一种新的诊断优先方法论，指导开发更稳健的生成式AI。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

*Youxu Shi,Suorong Yang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的自监督幻觉缓解方法，通过文本到图像投影揭示隐含幻觉信号，使用双锚点机制编辑解码器隐藏状态来减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但容易产生与视觉证据不一致的幻觉内容，现有缓解方法通常需要额外微调或牺牲信息量和可扩展性。

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间揭示隐含幻觉信号作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点，利用双锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，拉近表示与真实语义的距离，推离幻觉方向。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B在CHAIR上实现超过5%的幻觉减少，同时保持召回率和描述丰富度，在不同架构上验证了强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，对无幻觉描述几乎不产生副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: CoFFT是一种无需训练的方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知来增强视觉语言模型的推理能力，包含多样样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整三个阶段，在多基准测试中实现3.1-5.8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，这源于它们无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: 提出Foresight-Focus Thought链，包含三个阶段：1) 多样样本生成：探索潜在推理路径；2) 双重前瞻解码：基于视觉焦点和推理进展评估样本；3) 视觉焦点调整：精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next等多个基准测试中，CoFFT方法实现了3.1-5.8%的持续性能提升，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知的迭代推理过程，有效提升了视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，解决了复杂视觉输入中的干扰问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for

with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

Motivation: 面对面教学场景在计算机视觉领域缺乏系统研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和有限的分析技术。

Method: 构建了包含语音内容、韵律、注视、身体运动和视觉上下文等多模态信息的面对面教学数据集，并比较了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型的性能。

Result: 多模态大语言模型即使在没有任务特定微调的情况下，也优于专门的基线模型，显示出其在理解教学互动方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型有望实现对教学互动的整体理解，为教育支持和技能传递提供新的分析工具。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，但在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）和流匹配（FM）等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，从噪声分布直接合成分离后的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在标准AVE和MUSIC数据集上的比较评估表明，DAVIS的两个变体（DDPM和Flow Matching）在分离质量上都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架在处理音频-视觉源分离任务方面具有显著效果，能够产生高质量的声音分离结果，尤其适用于不同声音类别。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习方法对鲁棒且可泛化的深度伪造检测非常有效。

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Motivation: 现有的大规模重建模型虽然能高效实现高质量3D渲染，但无法生成资产的材质属性，这在多样化光照环境下的真实感渲染中至关重要。

Method: 首先微调新的多视角材质扩散模型，基于输入的深度和法线图生成多视角PBR图像；然后探索高斯材质表示，不仅与2D高斯泼溅对齐，还建模PBR材质的每个通道；最后通过渲染重建的点云获取PBR属性。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了带有PBR材质属性的高质量3D内容，支持通过应用各种环境光照图实现动态重光照，推动了3D内容创建的自动化和实用性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 提升GAN潜在空间的效率和可控性，使图像编辑更加直观和可解释。

Method: 将PCA降维技术集成到DragGAN框架中，应用于StyleGAN的W+潜在空间层，实现跨模型对齐和高效图像操作。

Result: 在AFHQ数据集上验证，PCA集成能显著减少优化时间，同时保持甚至提升图像质量（SSIM指标），特别是在较浅的潜在空间层（W+层=3）。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

TL;DR: MinerU2.5是一个1.2B参数的文档解析视觉语言模型，采用粗到细的两阶段解析策略，在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的识别精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档解析中高分辨率图像处理的计算开销问题，同时保持对密集文本、复杂公式和表格等细粒度细节的准确识别。

Method: 采用两阶段解析策略：第一阶段在降采样图像上进行高效布局分析识别结构元素，第二阶段基于全局布局在原始分辨率裁剪区域上进行针对性内容识别。开发了全面的数据引擎生成大规模训练语料。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，超越了通用和领域特定模型，同时保持了显著较低的计算开销。

Conclusion: MinerU2.5展示了强大的文档解析能力，在计算效率和识别精度之间取得了良好平衡，为文档解析任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

### [107] [Towards Faithful Reasoning in Remote Sensing: A Perceptually-Grounded GeoSpatial Chain-of-Thought for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22221)
*Jiaqi Liu,Lang Sun,Ronghao Fu,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT)框架，通过两阶段对齐策略训练RSThinker模型，实现可验证的多步骤遥感分析推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视觉语言模型在遥感领域复杂分析任务中的局限性，这些模型采用端到端训练范式，绕过了关键推理步骤，导致输出不可验证。

Method: 使用Geo-CoT380k数据集进行两阶段对齐：首先通过监督微调建立认知架构，然后使用组奖励策略优化来优化推理策略，确保事实正确性。

Result: RSThinker模型在广泛任务中显著优于最先进模型，能够输出最终答案及其可验证的分析轨迹。

Conclusion: Geo-CoT框架为地球观测从模糊感知向结构化、可验证推理提供了具体路径，相关数据集和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

### [108] [Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225)
*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义设计和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练、限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂多概念语义、易受跨视图语义不一致影响破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成并提升多粒度2D掩码到3D，为每个高斯点估计前景概率形成初始对象组，然后使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，最后通过视觉语言模型从最具代表性的视角解释对象外观，蒸馏出鲁棒的文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务上优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单语义限制。

Conclusion: 通过消除昂贵的逐场景训练过程，MUSplat提供了一种高效且有效的解决方案，能够处理复杂的多概念语义表示，并在开放词汇查询方面表现出色。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球一半以上人口，需要以人为本理解其结构和感知变化。现有基准在探索MLLMs在城市环境中的性能方面有限，缺乏对时间演化和与人类感知一致的主观城市环境的系统探索。

Method: 从全球11个代表性城市收集多时间单视图和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进的MLLMs，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅为1.5%。模型在基于场景理解的任务中表现良好，部分模型在像素级变化检测中甚至超越人类标注者，但在需要时间推理的任务中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: UrbanFeel基准揭示了MLLMs在城市发展理解方面的优势和局限，为可持续城市发展提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EXCL方法解决源自由无监督领域自适应问题，包含双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道，在无需源数据的情况下实现高性能领域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中源数据不可用时的领域自适应问题，现有方法要么只利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补洞察和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+视觉语言模型）和RAIN三阶段优化管道：协作检索伪源和复杂目标样本、分别微调专家、通过共享学习结果强制学习对象一致性。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: EXCL通过双专家协作学习和检索增强交互优化，在源自由无监督领域自适应任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: FlashEdit是一个实时图像编辑框架，通过三步创新实现高质量编辑：一步式反演编辑、背景保护技术和稀疏空间交叉注意力机制，速度比现有方法快150倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量卓越，但存在延迟过高的问题，阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 1. 一步式反演编辑(OSIE)管道，绕过昂贵的迭代过程；2. 背景保护(BG-Shield)技术，通过选择性修改编辑区域特征来保证背景保留；3. 稀疏空间交叉注意力(SSCA)机制，通过抑制语义泄漏到背景来确保精确的局部编辑。

Result: FlashEdit在保持卓越背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，比现有多步方法快150倍以上。

Conclusion: FlashEdit实现了高保真度的实时图像编辑，解决了现有方法延迟过高的问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/JunyiWuCode/FlashEdit.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench基准测试，专门用于评估神经学领域的多模态临床推理能力，发现现有视觉语言模型在真实临床推理任务上表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试过度强调分类准确性，导致模型看似熟练但实际在高风险诊断推理中失败，需要专门评估临床推理能力的基准。

Method: 开发了Neural-MedBench基准，整合多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记，包含鉴别诊断、病灶识别和推理生成三个核心任务家族，采用混合评分管道结合LLM评分器、临床医生验证和语义相似度指标。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等最先进VLM的系统评估显示，与传统数据集相比性能显著下降，错误分析表明推理失败而非感知错误是模型的主要短板。

Conclusion: 需要双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准（如Neural-MedBench）用于推理保真度，该基准可作为开放可扩展的诊断测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和人工标注，而现有卫星方法存在数据遮挡、过时以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续等问题。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：(1) 将车道线表示为离散序列，采用迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图向量；(2) 支持BEV、PV和文本提示的多模态输入架构；(3) 开发状态更新策略确保全局连续性和一致性。

Result: 在OpenSatMap数据集上达到最先进性能，能够推断被遮挡道路并预测数据集中缺失的道路标注。

Conclusion: UniMapGen为大规模地图构建提供了一个高效、灵活的生成式解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的统一框架，能够从多视角图像中同时进行网格重建和材质分解，特别擅长处理高反射表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反射表面，且依赖外部模型的先验知识来增强分解结果。

Method: 通过联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失函数和优化过程。

Result: 该方法能够生成与最先进方法相媲美的重建结果，为下游任务提供三角形网格及其关联的材质组件。

Conclusion: GS-2M框架在广泛使用的数据集上验证了有效性，能够同时解决网格重建和材质分解问题，特别适用于高反射表面的处理。

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MesaTask框架能够有效解决任务导向桌面场景生成的挑战，为机器人操作任务训练提供了高质量的合成场景数据

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Motivation: 尽管DeepSeek-R1已证明基于规则的强化学习的成功，但在文档分析领域强化学习应用较少。许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行实验研究。

Result: 强化学习在三种不同场景下对分布外数据表现出更好的泛化能力：分布外图像、未见过的类别和不同模态。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档图像分类任务中具有优越的泛化性能，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现突出。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种新颖的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个看似良性的场景来绕过T2V模型的安全机制，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到视频(T2V)模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和T2I模型的漏洞，但T2V模型的安全性仍未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: SceneSplit通过将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景，利用场景组合作为约束来引导生成结果。该方法还通过迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器，并使用策略库重用成功攻击模式来提高攻击效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上对T2V模型进行评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构攻击的影响，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合近期模型预测来提升扩散模型采样质量和效率，无需额外计算或训练即可实现更高质量的图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但其输出在较少的神经网络评估次数或较低引导尺度下仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均值之间的差异来引导采样过程，从而产生更真实、细节更丰富的输出。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在各种模型和架构下都能持续提升图像质量，使用预训练的SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256无引导生成中仅需30步采样就达到了1.61的FID新纪录。

Conclusion: HiGS作为一种即插即用的增强技术，能够实现更快速、保真度更高的扩散采样。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

TL;DR: VeloxSeg是一个轻量级3D医学图像分割框架，通过双流CNN-Transformer架构、配对窗口注意力和JLC卷积解决效率与鲁棒性冲突，在保持低计算预算的同时显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 采用可部署可扩展的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和JLC卷积，实现'瞥视-聚焦'原则；通过模态交互和多尺度图像检索建模异质模态；使用空间解耦知识转移(SDKT)注入纹理先验。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率与鲁棒性权衡问题，在保持低计算成本的同时显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个无需训练更新的DiT加速框架，通过三个轻量级策略头实现图像级自适应加速，采样速度提升近3倍且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高成本微调，缺乏零更新基础生成器的图像级自适应加速方案。

Method: 使用三个策略头（跳步、缓存重用、稀疏注意力）基于当前去噪状态独立决策，通过GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗判别器增强奖励信号。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等DiT骨干网络上，实现了近3倍的采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: RAPID3证明了无需更新基础生成器即可实现高效图像级自适应加速的可行性，为DiT的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Motivation: 当前的行人属性识别算法未能充分利用属性知识和上下文信息，虽然近期工作开始考虑使用属性文本作为额外输入来增强视觉与语义信息的关联，但这些方法仍处于初级阶段。

Method: 提出构建多模态知识图谱，考虑属性间关系以及属性与视觉标记之间的关系，并引入知识图谱引导的跨模态超图学习框架来增强标准行人属性识别框架。

Result: 在多个PAR基准数据集上的综合实验充分证明了所提出知识图谱对PAR任务的有效性。

Conclusion: 为知识引导的行人属性识别建立了坚实基础，相关源代码将在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程设计需要层次化抽象，从系统规范到组件实现，每个层级都需要视觉理解与数学推理的结合。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 提出了一个层次化合成生成流水线，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和带有自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器。对6个最先进的多模态大语言模型进行了全面评估，包括闭源和开源模型。

Result: 闭源模型在涉及组件识别和拓扑识别的感知任务上达到85%以上的准确率，但在符号推导和分析推理方面的性能低于19%，揭示了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上始终获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: 数学理解在电路合成中具有根本作用，符号推理是衡量工程能力的关键指标。当前模型在视觉到数学推理方面存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Method: 使用预训练GPT-4模型，通过专门设计的提示词和输入图像，让模型分析图像并生成顺序预测，解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Conclusion: 该模型能够以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

Method: 首先训练视觉语言模型通过参考图像和目标图像之间的相对空间推理来识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的细粒度分割能力相结合，实现小解剖区域的定位和像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于使用相同内存设置的SAM2微调基线，产生更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索视觉语言模型在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的工作，其优异性能突显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中解剖理解的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得完整边界的初始融合结果，引入Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的焦点度量来精炼边界。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于显著边界增强的方法能有效生成高质量融合边界，提升多焦点图像融合性能。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型可解释性的方法，通过视觉分支的多尺度解释聚合和文本分支的激活排序相关性，解决现有方法忽视模态内依赖关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽视了模态内依赖关系。视觉模态中孤立图像块归因忽略了空间上下文，文本模态中依赖前文标记引入了虚假激活，这些干扰影响了归因的保真度。

Method: 视觉分支采用多尺度解释聚合，通过多尺度输入聚合归因来动态调整感受野；文本分支采用激活排序相关性，通过前k个预测排名的对齐来测量上下文标记的相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在多个最先进的多模态大语言模型和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法一致优于现有可解释性方法，产生了更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 通过利用模态内交互增强可解释性，提出的方法能够生成更全面、空间连贯的视觉解释和语义连贯的文本解释，显著提升了多模态大语言模型决策机制的理解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探索使用2D高斯泼溅作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，实现了90倍加速的拟合效率和3-20倍的输入压缩，虽然准确率略低于RGB编码器，但证明了2DGS作为多模态基底的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RGB视觉编码器的两个结构性问题：(i) 从边缘设备传输密集RGB图像到云端能耗高、成本大；(ii) 基于补丁的标记化导致序列长度爆炸，增加注意力预算和上下文限制的压力。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过重用冻结的RGB变换器骨干，添加轻量级泼溅感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，仅训练约7%的总参数来适应对比语言图像预训练。

Result: 在大型DataComp子集上，GS编码器在实现有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能的同时，相对于像素将输入压缩了3到20倍；虽然准确率目前落后于RGB编码器，但证明了2DGS作为多模态基底的可行性。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基底，识别了架构瓶颈，并为开发既具有语义能力又传输高效的表征开辟了路径，特别适用于边缘-云端学习场景。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

TL;DR: 提出了TDOA方法，通过聚类训练替代模型将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，使用最远标签目标攻击策略提高攻击效果，在动态和静态输出场景中都取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景（固定输出标签和预定义标签空间）的问题，需要适应动态输出场景。

Method: 采用基于聚类的替代模型训练方法将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，提出最远标签目标攻击策略选择偏离模型粗粒度标签最远的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上评估，单次查询最大攻击成功率50.81%；在传统静态输出场景中最大ASR达82.68%；在生成式设置中超过先前结果0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法在动态输出场景中有效，对大型语言模型具有强大威胁潜力，同时在静态场景和生成式任务中也表现出色。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据策展深度研究代理，通过多模态语言模型驱动的编排器，实现校准发现、可控合成和共识标注三大核心功能，显著提升大规模数据集构建的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建高质量、领域特定的数据集是部署鲁棒视觉系统的主要瓶颈，需要在数据质量、多样性和成本之间进行复杂权衡，特别是在处理海量未标记数据时。

Method: 采用多模态语言模型驱动的中央编排器，通过多步推理执行三个核心工具：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据；可控合成生成罕见场景的新数据；共识标注通过结合非极大值抑制和投票的新机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签。

Result: 在密集的COCO数据集上，共识标注模块平均每张图像产生14.2个候选提案，几乎是真实标注7.4个的两倍，最终标注mAP达到37.1%。在Open Images数据集上发现了903个新的边界框类别，总能力扩展到1500多个类别。校准发现在1000万样本规模测试中，主动学习策略比替代方案计算效率高出40倍。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为构建工业规模数据集提供了鲁棒基础，验证了Labeling Copilot组件在数据发现、合成和标注方面的有效性。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用逻辑张量网络（LTNs）将医学背景知识编码到语义分割模型的损失函数中，以提高医学图像分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的医学图像语义分割系统在面对噪声和伪影时仍有改进空间，作者认为通过将医学背景知识融入模型可以提升性能。

Method: 使用逻辑张量网络（LTNs）通过一阶逻辑规则编码医学背景知识，包括分割形状约束和不同分割区域间的关系，并与SwinUNETR结合构建端到端的分割框架。

Result: 在脑部MRI海马体分割任务上的实验表明，LTNs能够提升基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下效果更明显。

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是第一个细粒度、时空感知的基准数据集，用于标注人类感知的AI生成视频伪造痕迹，包含4.3K详细标注和9类主要伪造痕迹类别，训练的多模态奖励模型在伪造线索识别、定位和解释方面优于GPT-5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型快速发展，但人类能否检测生成视频中的深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度被忽视，需要建立能够评估人类感知伪造痕迹的基准。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注提供自然语言解释、边界框区域定位和精确时间戳，训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型来模仿人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在伪造线索识别、定位和解释方面平均优于GPT-5 34.7%，发现一致的难度梯度：二元分类最容易，细粒度检测较难，其中时间标注最难。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信赖的视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VARE框架和S-VARE方法，专门针对视觉自回归模型的稳定概念擦除，通过辅助视觉令牌和过滤交叉熵损失实现精确的概念移除，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在文本到图像生成方面取得快速进展，但带来了新的安全隐患。现有的概念擦除技术主要针对扩散模型，无法适用于自回归模型的下一尺度令牌预测范式。

Method: 提出VARE框架利用辅助视觉令牌减少微调强度，S-VARE方法包含过滤交叉熵损失精确识别和最小调整不安全视觉令牌，以及保持损失维持语义保真度。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法能够实现精确的概念擦除，同时保持生成质量，解决了早期方法引入的语言漂移和多样性减少问题。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了自回归文本到图像生成中的安全空白，为视觉自回归模型提供了有效的概念擦除解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CapRL框架，使用强化学习和可验证奖励来训练图像描述模型，通过非视觉语言模型基于描述回答问题的准确性来评估描述质量，避免了传统监督微调对人工标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的图像描述模型依赖监督微调，需要昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型过度记忆特定答案，缺乏泛化能力和创造性。需要一种不依赖人工标注的替代训练方法。

Method: CapRL采用解耦的两阶段流程：LVLM生成图像描述，然后基于该描述让无视觉的LLM回答多项选择题，根据回答准确率计算客观奖励。使用强化学习与可验证奖励范式训练模型。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升。在Prism框架评估中，性能与Qwen2.5-VL-72B相当，比基线平均提高8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL成功将RLVR范式应用于主观的图像描述任务，提供了一种不依赖人工标注的有效训练方法，显著提升了模型的描述质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FreqDebias框架解决深度伪造检测器中的频谱偏差问题，通过频率混合增强和双重一致性正则化提升跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器由于从有限训练数据中学习到偏差，往往难以泛化到新的伪造类型。本文识别出一种新的频率域模型偏差——频谱偏差，即检测器过度依赖特定频带，限制了其对未见伪造类型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出FreqDebias频率去偏框架：1) 伪造混合增强(Fo-Mixup)，动态多样化训练样本的频率特性；2) 双重一致性正则化，通过类激活图实现局部一致性，通过超球嵌入空间上的von Mises-Fisher分布实现全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，FreqDebias显著增强了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FreqDebias框架通过缓解频谱偏差，有效提升了深度伪造检测器的泛化性能，为解决检测器对特定频率成分的过度依赖问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一个无需图像描述的通用图像修复框架，通过双分支调节器和时间步自适应调制方案，在保持语义的同时有效修复混合退化图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图像修复方法在未知混合退化条件下容易产生过度平滑、幻觉或语义漂移的问题，特别是避免对图像描述的依赖。

Method: 采用大型扩散变换器(Flux.1)，引入轻量级双分支调节器注入退化输入和轻度修复代理的信号，设计时间步和层级自适应调制方案，并利用SigLIP特征实现无描述的语义对齐。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，LucidFlux持续优于强大的开源和商业基线方法，消融研究验证了各组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何调节——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现鲁棒且无需描述的通用图像修复的关键因素。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：简单的跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距，以及缺乏深层多尺度特征提取能力，导致医学图像分割中细粒度细节和精确边界难以保持。

Method: 提出了U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在三个公开数据集(BUSI、GLAS和CVC)上的实验表明，U-MAN优于最先进的方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过创新的多尺度自适应KAN和注意力特征融合机制，有效解决了医学图像分割中的细节保持和边界精度问题，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的分割提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Motivation: 当前大多数模式识别模型都基于预处理数据开发，但许多现代视觉任务和可穿戴设备活动识别任务并不需要人类参与，这种预处理可能不是最优的。特别是在低带宽和能量受限的场景下，传感器只能进行低位深度捕获，需要更高效的数据处理方法。

Method: 提出了γ-Quant方法，即任务特定的非线性量化学习。该方法通过可学习的非线性量化来处理原始数据，在仅使用4位量化数据的情况下实现模式识别任务。

Result: 在原始图像目标检测和可穿戴设备活动识别任务上验证了方法的有效性，结果表明使用4位可学习量化的原始数据可以达到与使用12位原始数据相当的性能。

Conclusion: γ-Quant方法能够在低带宽和能量受限的环境下，通过任务特定的非线性量化学习，显著降低数据传输需求，同时保持模式识别性能，为可穿戴设备和边缘计算等应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据的问题，传统方法仅关注融合图像质量，而应用导向方法需要分割或检测标签，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割和像素级融合分割之间的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的大量实验证明SSVIF的有效性，仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，性能优于传统VIF方法，与有监督分割导向方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架SSVIF能够有效解决应用导向VIF方法的数据标注问题，在无分割标签情况下实现高质量融合。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像不同模态间存在较大域差距，现有基于GAN的风格迁移方法在高度可变区域难以捕捉跨域映射。

Method: 首先使用Bézier曲线风格迁移减少域差距，然后用分割模型生成伪标签，训练条件扩散模型合成带标签的目标域图像，并开发不确定性引导的分数匹配方法处理噪声伪标签。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法能生成逼真的带标签图像，显著增强目标域数据并改善分割性能。

Conclusion: Bézier Meets Diffusion框架能有效解决医学影像跨域适应问题，通过生成高质量合成图像提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

*Xiangmo Zhao,Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PSTTS模块，通过空间令牌净化和时间令牌选择两阶段处理，有效识别并丢弃事件数据中的时空冗余令牌，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件帧序列的方法忽略了事件帧序列的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致显著的计算开销。现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法依赖不可靠的中间令牌表示且忽略了事件噪声的影响，无法直接应用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：1）空间令牌净化：通过评估每个事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域；2）时间令牌选择：通过评估相邻事件帧之间的运动模式相似性来精确识别和移除冗余时间信息。该模块无需额外参数，可直接插入现有模型。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上测试了UniformerV2、VideoSwin、EVMamba和ExACT四个代表性骨干网络。PSTTS在DailyDVS-200数据集上减少FLOPs 29-43.6%，提升FPS 21.6-41.3%，同时保持任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS通过利用原始事件数据中的时空分布特性，有效解决了事件数据中的时空冗余问题，实现了精度与效率的最佳平衡，是一个即插即用的高效模块。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results

TL;DR: 本文提出了GCPO方法，通过识别图像生成中的关键token并进行针对性优化，仅使用30%的token就能达到比全token优化更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像token进行统一优化，但不同token对RLVR训练的贡献度不同，需要识别关键token并进行有效优化。

Method: 从三个角度识别关键token：因果依赖关系、熵诱导的空间结构、RLVR关注的token多样性。对关键token引入动态token-wise优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO仅使用30%的token就能获得比GRPO全token优化更好的性能。

Conclusion: GCPO方法通过有效识别和优化关键token，在自回归视觉生成中取得了显著效果提升。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

TL;DR: HERMAN方法通过利用LLM生成分层文本描述符，增强CLIP在类增量学习中的语义空间，实现精确区分并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法使用简单模板（如"a photo of a [CLASS]"）忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且仅使用最后一层特征，忽视了早期层的分层信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成区分性文本描述符，将这些描述符匹配到语义层次的不同级别，并根据任务需求自适应路由。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过分层表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级黑盒框架，用于解释多模态大语言模型中的自回归token生成，通过将生成的token归因于紧凑的感知区域，并量化语言先验和感知证据的相对影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度仍不清楚，这限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE引入了一个统一充分性（洞察分数）和必要性（必要分数）的目标函数，通过稀疏化图像区域的贪心搜索进行优化，实现忠实且高效的归因。

Result: 在开源多模态大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE在忠实性、定位和幻觉诊断方面始终优于现有方法，同时需要显著更少的GPU内存。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过提供细粒度的模型决策可解释性，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的可解释性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面的能力，发现模型在典型颜色上表现良好，但在非典型颜色上表现显著下降，并揭示了模型在颜色命名上的两种不同策略以及跨语言训练不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型的普及，理解它们是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要。颜色作为人类视觉感知的基本维度，是沟通物体和场景的主要方式。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本，在五个代表性模型上复制经典的颜色命名方法学，进行跨语言分析（涵盖九种语言）和消融研究。

Result: 视觉语言模型在经典研究中的典型颜色上达到高准确率，但在扩展的非典型颜色集上性能显著下降。识别出21个在所有模型中一致出现的颜色术语，揭示了两种不同策略：受限模型主要使用基本术语，而扩展模型使用系统的明度修饰词。跨语言分析显示训练严重偏向英语和中文，色相是颜色命名决策的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 语言模型架构显著影响颜色命名，独立于视觉处理能力。研究结果对开发更符合人类感知的视觉语言模型具有重要意义。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EfficientDepth的单目深度估计系统，结合transformer架构和轻量卷积解码器，通过双模态密度头和LPIPS损失函数实现高精度深度图估计，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在几何一致性、细节保留、对反射表面等真实世界挑战的鲁棒性以及边缘设备效率方面存在不足，需要开发既能满足3D重建和视图合成需求又高效的系统。

Method: 结合transformer架构与轻量卷积解码器，使用双模态密度头估计详细深度图；采用合成和真实图像的混合训练数据，包括伪标签真实图像；实施多阶段优化策略，引入基于LPIPS的损失函数以增强细节。

Result: 实验结果表明，EfficientDepth在性能上达到或优于现有最先进模型，同时显著减少了计算资源需求。

Conclusion: EfficientDepth系统成功解决了单目深度估计中的关键挑战，在保持高性能的同时实现了计算效率的提升，适用于各种计算机视觉应用。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合SSL-LLM模型，结合自监督学习和大型语言模型来检测复杂视频异常，在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有方法提升12.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频异常检测面临识别复杂异常的挑战，这些异常由多个实体间的复杂关系和时序依赖定义。自监督学习方法难以理解交互的语义含义，而大型语言模型计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位。

Method: HyCoVAD结合多任务SSL时序分析器和LLM验证器。SSL模块基于nnFormer骨干网络，通过多个代理任务从视频帧中识别可疑异常帧，然后由LLM应用结构化、基于规则的推理来验证异常存在。

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上的实验显示，HyCoVAD达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线方法提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量。

Conclusion: HyCoVAD通过结合SSL和LLM的优势，有效解决了复杂视频异常检测问题，并发布了交互异常分类法、自适应阈值协议和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

TL;DR: JanusVLN提出了一种新颖的视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆来建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了现有方法中的空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀问题，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型的VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），存在空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀等问题，阻碍了高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出双隐式神经记忆框架。

Method: 提出JanusVLN框架，包含空间几何编码器和视觉语义编码器，构建双隐式神经记忆。扩展MLLM以融入空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力。通过保留初始和滑动窗口中token的键值缓存，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 在广泛实验中，JanusVLN优于20多种最新方法，达到最先进性能。与使用多种数据类型输入的方法相比，成功率提高10.5-35.5；与使用更多RGB训练数据的方法相比，成功率提高3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Result: 实验表明，SpikeMatch在各种标准基准测试中优于现有适应SNN骨干网络的半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功证明了利用SNN时间动态特性进行半监督学习的有效性，为SNN的SSL研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

Motivation: 长视频生成在效率和质量方面面临挑战：扩散模型质量高但效率低，因果注意力AR模型支持KV缓存但长视频训练时质量下降。此外，交互式能力（如流式提示输入）对动态内容创作至关重要，但增加了视觉一致性和语义连贯性的复杂性。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制用于平滑提示切换，流式长调优实现长视频训练和训练-推理对齐，短窗口注意力配合帧级注意力汇聚保持长程一致性并加速生成。

Result: 在32 GPU天内将13亿参数的短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，推理时在单个NVIDIA H100上维持20.7 FPS，在VBench上短长视频均表现优异，支持单H100 GPU上240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理仅轻微质量损失。

Conclusion: LongLive通过创新的架构设计成功解决了长视频生成的效率和质量挑战，支持实时交互式生成，为动态内容创作提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个高效、在线的协同进化框架，通过回收RLVR中的轨迹和正确性数据来同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，无需单独奖励模型或人类偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励-策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信息的问题，提出更高效的协同进化方法。

Method: 在RLVR基础上，回收轨迹和正确性数据，使用点对奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等多目标训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，形成策略和奖励协同进化的反馈循环。

Result: SPARK在多个LLM和LVLM模型上取得显著性能提升，如SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，在2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，在8个通用基准上提升1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK框架通过策略和奖励的协同进化实现了高效稳定的后预训练，支持测试时自我反思扩展，具有鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但受计算能力限制。立体图像对提供有效解决方案，但获取可靠地面真实深度数据困难，因此需要自监督技术

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，结合新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并重新设计了深度估计解码器

Conclusion: CCNeXt在自监督深度估计中实现了计算效率和精度的良好平衡，优于现有方法

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

Motivation: 传统思维链(CoT)提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性受限。现有结构化CoT方法只能建模低阶关系，缺乏继承或行为抽象等构造，也没有顺序或条件规划的标准语义。

Method: 提出UML-CoT框架，使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流。采用三阶段训练流程，结合监督微调和组相对策略优化(GRPO)，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

*Luc Boudier,Loris Manganelli,Eleftherios Tsonis,Nicolas Dufour,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIPSY是一种无需训练的少样本图像分类方法，利用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换生成判别性合成图像，无需模型微调或外部工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本图像分类面临标记样本有限的问题，现有方法通常需要大量模型微调或外部信息源，需要一种更简单有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案、基于类别相似度的采样策略，以及无需微调的简单流程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上达到最先进或相当的性能，特别在细粒度分类任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: DIPSY证明了通过正负引导的双重图像提示生成类别判别特征的有效性，无需生成模型适应或外部工具依赖。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了视觉自回归生成(VAR)模型，发现当配备马尔可夫注意力掩码时，VAR在数学上等价于离散扩散模型，建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归变换器在视觉生成中表现出色，甚至超越了基于扩散的模型。本文旨在探索VAR与扩散模型之间的理论联系，以结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出SRDD框架，将VAR重新解释为离散扩散模型，利用马尔可夫注意力掩码实现数学等价性，并引入扩散模型的迭代优化优势。

Result: 通过扩散视角重新审视VAR，实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的推理成本和改进的零样本重建能力，在多个数据集上均获得效率和生成质量的提升。

Conclusion: 建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁，证明了将扩散模型优势整合到VAR中可以显著提升性能，为视觉生成模型提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

TL;DR: 提出RefAM框架，无需训练或架构修改，直接利用扩散变换器的特征和注意力机制实现零样本的指代表达分割，在图像和视频基准测试中达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指代表达分割方法通常需要微调或组合多个预训练模型，而大规模生成扩散模型编码了丰富的语义信息，可作为通用特征提取器。

Method: 利用扩散变换器的特征和注意力分数，识别并处理停止词作为注意力磁铁和全局注意力汇，提出注意力重分配策略，开发无需训练的RefAM框架。

Result: 在零样本指代表达图像和视频分割基准测试中，该方法持续优于先前方法，无需微调或额外组件即达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的注意力机制可直接用于下游任务，通过适当的注意力处理策略，无需训练即可实现强大的指代表达分割性能。

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双模型架构，通过投影融合块和差分特征学习机制来检测大语言模型的幻觉现象，发现幻觉信号高度集中在稀疏特征子集中，仅使用1%的特征维度即可维持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是一个关键挑战，现有研究虽然发现特定隐藏层在幻觉内容和事实内容之间存在差异，但幻觉信号在层内的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 提出双模型架构，包含投影融合块用于自适应层间特征加权，以及差分特征学习机制通过计算并行编码器之间的差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval的问答、对话和摘要数据集上的实验表明，幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，在问答和对话任务上实现了显著的准确率提升。分析揭示了分层的"漏斗模式"，浅层特征多样性高，深层特征使用集中。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更加集中，这为开发计算高效的检测系统提供了途径，可以在保持准确性的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的上下文质量评估方法CI值，通过衡量移除每个上下文对性能的影响来量化上下文质量，并开发了参数化代理模型进行预测，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法因检索到的上下文质量差（包含不相关或噪声信息）而效果受限，传统基于预定义质量指标的上下文选择方法改进有限，因为它们未能充分利用可用信息进行全面的质量评估。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新概念化为推理时数据估值问题，引入上下文影响力值(CI值)来量化上下文质量；开发参数化代理模型预测CI值，采用分层架构捕获局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进基线，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: CI值提供了一种全面的上下文质量评估方法，通过集成查询感知相关性、列表感知独特性和生成器感知对齐，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at
https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM提供商宣传的最大上下文窗口在实际使用中的有效性，揭示真实性能与宣传数据的差距。

Method: 1) 定义最大有效上下文窗口概念 2) 制定测试方法评估不同大小和问题类型的上下文窗口有效性 3) 创建标准化比较方法寻找失效点

Result: 收集数十万数据点发现：MECW与MCW存在显著差异；顶级模型在100个token时就可能失败；大多数模型在1000个token时准确率严重下降；所有模型都远未达到其宣传的MCW。

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口随问题类型变化，这为如何提高模型准确率和减少幻觉率提供了明确可行的见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

TL;DR: 该研究系统调查了LLM在不同语言中的道德决策差异，发现其道德判断存在显著不一致性，反映了文化错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM主要基于英语数据训练，但在多语言和多文化环境中部署时，其道德推理能力存在泛化问题，需要研究语言如何调节LLM的道德决策。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上不同的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，并通过精心构建的研究问题分析差异的驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLM在不同语言中的道德判断存在显著不一致性，往往反映文化错位，并揭示了从分歧到推理策略等潜在驱动因素。

Conclusion: 研究提出了道德推理错误的分类体系，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难，大型语言模型提供了通过结构化、可解释输出增强决策支持的机会。

Method: 使用完全基于合成病例的模拟框架，结合ADA 2025护理标准和公共数据集，测试GPT-5在五个代表性场景中的表现。

Result: GPT-5在病例分类、生成临床推理、患者解释和结构化JSON摘要方面表现出与ADA定义标准的高度一致性。

Conclusion: GPT-5可作为临床医生和患者的双重用途工具，同时强调了可重复评估框架在负责任评估医疗领域LLMs中的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

Motivation: 道德对齐通常通过微调或模型编辑来实现，但往往以降低下游任务性能为代价。现有研究试图通过精心设计的公平目标来实现性能权衡，但缺乏对底层机制的理解。

Method: 通过遗忘和公平目标的视角，分析在减轻性别刻板印象背景下的性能权衡机制，特别关注选择性遗忘对整体遗忘水平的影响。

Result: 分析表明：(1)下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；(2)选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘；(3)通用的遗忘缓解方法无法减少整体遗忘，也无法改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前的公平目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，需要开发更有效的策略来平衡道德对齐与模型性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

Method: 采用简单通用的训练方法：精心选择提示和模型，使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热，然后进行严格的在线RLVR训练。

Result: 在BIRD排行榜上首次提交即达到私有测试集的最先进准确率：无自一致性73.56%，有自一致性75.68%，且所需生成次数少于第二名方法。

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是代理任务，但该框架的简洁性使其广泛适用于企业领域，如商业智能、数据科学和编程。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习可验证奖励框架中引入混合token生成方法，通过利用模型概率分布信息而非仅采样离散token，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在推理过程中仅采样离散token，丢弃了模型概率分布中的丰富信息，不必要地限制了推理搜索空间。

Method: 提出混合token生成框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间，包括构建混合嵌入作为token嵌入的加权和，直接在连续混合空间中生成思维链。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法相比标准解码获得显著提升（10个任务中7个有5-35%增益），且仅用一半轨迹数就能达到相当精度。

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持更高的隐藏状态熵和促进token空间探索，有效提升了推理性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought提示在提升分类准确率的同时引入显著吞吐量惩罚的问题，寻求准确率与效率的平衡。

Method: Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation：为解码器语言模型添加池化分类头（训练和推理时使用）和推理头（仅训练时使用），使用标签交叉熵和token级语言模型损失的加权和进行训练。

Result: 在7个SuperGLUE任务上相对池化基线提升0.65-5.47%，在蕴含/因果任务上提升更显著；推理吞吐量匹配池化分类器，比相同骨干网络的CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法成功解决了CoT在准确率与效率间的权衡，实现了准确率提升的同时保持高效推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

Motivation: 研究代码数据中哪些方面对提升大语言模型推理能力最为关键，目前尚不清楚。

Method: 构建十种编程语言的并行指令数据集，应用受控扰动选择性地破坏代码的结构或语义特性，在五个模型家族和八个规模上微调LLMs，评估其在自然语言、数学和代码任务上的表现。

Result: 在3,331次实验中，LLMs对结构扰动比语义扰动更敏感，特别是在数学和代码任务上。伪代码和流程图等适当抽象与代码效果相当，甚至更好。即使信号误导的损坏代码，只要表面规律存在，仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 代码的不同特性对推理能力有不同影响，结构特性比语义特性更重要，适当的抽象可以替代代码，这些发现为设计提升LLM推理能力的训练数据提供了指导。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了非洲口音英语的说话人日志在不同领域的表现，发现临床对话存在显著的领域惩罚，主要源于误报和漏检。通过轻量级领域适应方法可以减少错误，但无法完全消除差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索说话人日志在不同领域（特别是临床对话）的性能差异，以及如何通过领域适应来改善性能。

Method: 使用严格DER协议评估多个生产和开源系统在通用和临床对话上的表现，通过错误分析识别问题来源，并测试在口音匹配数据上微调分割模块的轻量级领域适应方法。

Result: 发现临床语音存在一致的领域惩罚，主要错误类型是误报和漏检，与短轮次和频繁重叠相关。领域适应方法可以减少错误但不能完全消除差距。

Conclusion: 结论是需要重叠感知的分割和平衡的临床资源作为实际改进方向，并提供了一个易于复现的适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

TL;DR: 本文比较了两种LLM引用范式：生成时引用(G-Cite)和后处理引用(P-Cite)，发现在高风险应用中推荐采用检索为中心的P-Cite优先方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗、法律、学术和金融中，可信赖的LLM必须引用可验证的来源，因为即使小错误也可能带来严重后果。

Method: 引入两种引用范式：G-Cite在解码时同时生成答案和引用，P-Cite先草拟答案再添加或验证引用。在四个流行归属数据集上从零样本到高级检索增强方法进行全面评估。

Result: 结果显示覆盖率和引用正确性之间存在一致权衡，检索是两种范式中归属质量的主要驱动因素。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率且具有竞争性的正确性和中等延迟，而G-Cite方法以覆盖率和速度为代价优先考虑精确度。

Conclusion: 推荐高风险应用采用检索为中心、P-Cite优先的方法，为严格声明验证等精度关键场景保留G-Cite方法。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

Motivation: 为了满足用户对摘要写作风格和内容焦点的个性化偏好，需要识别用户偏好的细粒度差异，通过比较给定用户偏好与其他用户偏好来实现有效个性化。

Method: ComPSum框架首先生成用户的结构化分析，通过比较其偏好与其他用户偏好，然后使用该分析指导生成个性化摘要。提出了AuthorMap评估框架和PerMSum数据集。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估，ComPSum的表现优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好与其他用户偏好来识别细粒度差异，可以有效实现个性化多文档摘要，ComPSum框架在该任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出五种VLM作为形式化器的管道，用于解决单次学习、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化问题，在真实、多视角、低质量图像的规划任务中表现优于端到端规划生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长时程规划任务中表现不足。文本领域通过将规划问题转化为PDDL形式化语言取得了显著进展，但多模态环境中的相关研究仍然稀缺。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的管道，包括单次学习、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化方法，并在现有基准和两个新基准上进行评估，新基准首次考虑了真实、多视角和低质量图像的规划问题。

Result: VLM作为形式化器在性能上大幅优于端到端规划生成方法。研究发现瓶颈在于视觉而非语言处理，因为VLM经常无法捕捉到必要的完整对象关系集合。

Conclusion: 生成中间文本表示（如描述或场景图）可以部分弥补性能不足，但其增益不一致，为多模态规划形式化的未来研究留下了发展空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译比喻性语言（如习语和双关语）时的本地化能力，发现尽管模型能生成语法正确的翻译，但在文化适应性方面仍有明显不足，需要大量人工修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准主要关注语法准确性和词汇正确性，而忽略了文化适应性和整体本地化质量这些对实际应用（如营销和电子商务）至关重要的因素。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电子商务营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种区域方言。由精通目标语言的人类评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈，评估翻译对原文语气、含义和目标受众的忠实度。

Result: 研究发现，即使是资源丰富的主流语言，在翻译比喻性表达和文字游戏时也经常出错。文化细微差别仍然是需要改进的明显领域。

Conclusion: 这项研究挑战了数据量是机器翻译质量最可靠预测因素的假设，并引入文化适应性作为多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素。建议扩大研究规模以提供可推广的见解，并为在文化多样化环境中部署可靠的机器翻译工作流程提供指导。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间适应来减少长上下文推理的内存占用，无需模型微调即可保持或提升零样本准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的长上下文能力受到KV缓存内存瓶颈的限制，现有静态低秩投影方法在数据分布变化时性能下降。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留关键的首尾token作为锚点，对中间token使用基于Oja算法的在线PCA进行低秩压缩，包含预填充阶段的全面更新和解码阶段的轻量级定期更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持或提升零样本准确性，在需要复杂推理的极长上下文基准测试中表现最佳，证明了在线子空间适应的重要性。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个实用、即插即用的解决方案，可在不进行模型微调的情况下实现内存高效的长上下文推理。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Motivation: 语言模型的黑盒特性在高风险领域应用时存在透明度问题，而现有的XAI方法在应用于LM时面临架构复杂、训练数据量大等独特挑战，现有综述未能充分捕捉这些挑战。

Method: 按transformer架构（编码器-仅、解码器-仅、编码器-解码器）组织XAI技术，分析每种架构下方法的适应性，并通过合理性和忠实性双重视角评估其有效性。

Result: 提供了针对不同LM架构的XAI技术系统分类和分析框架，揭示了各类方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 识别了开放研究挑战并指明了未来发展方向，旨在指导开发更稳健、透明和可解释的LM XAI方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿数量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠的方法来检测低质量评审中的错误信息。

Method: 定义了错误信息评审点，构建了人类专家标注的ReviewScore数据集，提出了自动化引擎重构弱点中的显性和隐性前提，使用8个最先进的LLMs评估人类与模型在ReviewScore上的一致性。

Result: 验证了15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题是错误信息的，人类与LLMs在ReviewScore评估上达到中等一致性，前提级事实性评估比弱点级事实性评估显示出显著更高的一致性。

Conclusion: 前提级事实性评估比弱点级评估更可靠，完全自动化的ReviewScore评估具有潜力，有望提高同行评审质量。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

TL;DR: ToG-3提出了一个基于多智能体上下文演化和检索机制的图增强检索生成框架，通过动态构建和优化Chunk-Triplets-Community异构图索引，解决了传统图RAG方法中静态图构建的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临根本性权衡：手动构建知识图谱成本高昂难以扩展，而自动提取的图谱受限于底层LLM提取器的性能。传统方法通常一次性构建静态图索引，无法适应实际查询需求。

Method: 采用多智能体系统（Constructor、Retriever、Reflector、Responser），通过查询演化和子图演化的双重演化机制，在推理过程中自适应地构建目标图索引。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，ToG-3在深度和广度推理基准测试中均优于对比基线，消融研究证实了MACER框架各组成部分的有效性。

Conclusion: ToG-3通过双重演化的多智能体系统，能够使用轻量级LLM实现深度精确推理，克服了传统一次性图构建的固有缺陷。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Motivation: 工业环境中，LLMs在长上下文多问题回答任务面临高计算成本和延迟的挑战，特别是基于相同上下文回答多个问题时。

Method: 对专有和公共LLMs进行广泛实验和基准测试，评估它们在相同对话上下文中回答多个问题的能力。

Result: 虽然GPT-4o等专有LLMs整体性能最佳，但经过微调的8B参数公共LLMs在准确率上可以超越GPT-4o。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自推测偏置解码方法，用于加速流式应用中的同时翻译，避免重复从头生成输出，实现了1.7倍加速并减少80%的闪烁


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在流式应用（如实时翻译）中需要持续更新输出但计算成本高的问题，满足低延迟要求

Method: 使用最近输出作为草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，无需草稿计算，是模型无关的即插即用解决方案

Result: 在同时文本重翻译任务上实现1.7倍加速，质量不下降，结合mask-k技术减少80%闪烁

Conclusion: 该方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了有效的加速方案，无需额外草稿计算，显著提升用户体验

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

TL;DR: 提出了Thinking-with-Sound框架，通过结合语言推理和实时音频分析，为大音频语言模型提供音频思维链能力，显著提升了在复杂声学场景下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大音频语言模型在复杂声学场景下的音频推理任务中表现不佳，缺乏对噪声抑制、源分离等声学工具的访问能力，需要增强模型的音频推理能力。

Method: 开发了Thinking-with-Sound框架，使模型能够主动思考音频信号，通过多模态推理进行数值分析和数字处理，而不是将音频作为静态输入处理。

Result: 在MELD-Hard1k基准测试中，TwS显著提升了模型鲁棒性：小模型准确率提升24.73%，大模型提升36.61%，而现有最先进模型在扰动音频上准确率下降超过50%。

Conclusion: 音频思维链能够在不重新训练的情况下显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更强大的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

TL;DR: SynerGen是一个统一的生成式推荐模型，通过单一生成骨干网络同时处理个性化搜索和推荐任务，在检索和排序方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索-排序推荐系统存在校准问题和工程开销，而现有的生成式方法通常在个性化搜索或推荐之间面临性能权衡，需要一种统一的解决方案。

Method: 使用仅解码器的Transformer，结合InfoNCE损失进行检索优化和混合点对-配对损失进行排序优化，并提出时间感知旋转位置编码来整合时间信息。

Result: 在广泛采用的推荐和搜索基准测试中，相比强大的生成式推荐器和联合搜索推荐基线，SynerGen取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了单一生成基础模型在工业级统一信息访问中的可行性。

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估方法存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制不足、依赖粗糙指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，在七个公开任务和一个开发推理任务上进行因果推断分析。

Result: 粗糙指标显示结构化输出对GPT-4o生成有正、负或中性影响，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个无因果影响，仅5个存在因果效应。

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响被先前研究高估，实际因果效应有限且受具体指令影响。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化相关数据集，无法有效评估模型的文化意识，这对LLMs的全球对齐至关重要。

Method: 构建CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域；提出Think-as-Locals方法，通过RLVR技术激发生成式奖励模型进行更深层的文化推理。

Result: 评估显示现有奖励模型在文化意识建模方面存在缺陷，CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务呈正相关；Think-as-Locals能有效缓解虚假特征干扰。

Conclusion: CARB基准填补了文化意识评估的空白，Think-as-Locals方法能显著提升文化意识奖励建模的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展动作空间的同步机器翻译方法，在传统READ/WRITE动作基础上增加了四种自适应动作，使用解码器专用大语言模型实现，在质量和延迟方面均优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略的READ/WRITE动作无法充分满足同步机器翻译在严格实时约束下的高质量翻译需求。

Method: 扩展同步机器翻译的动作空间，增加SENTENCE_CUT、DROP、PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION和PRONOMINALIZATION四种自适应动作，在解码器专用大语言模型框架中实现，并通过动作感知提示构建训练参考。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续改善语义指标（如COMET-KIWI），并实现比参考翻译和基于salami的基线更低的延迟（通过平均滞后衡量）。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译的动作空间为弥合人类和机器口译之间的差距提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于"学习注意力"的多模态语言理解方法容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化性能下降

Method: 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声，使用参数化掩码生成器将融合的多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示，加入工具变量约束和反事实调整来稳定因果估计

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务及OOD测试集上的实验证明了CaMIB的有效性

Conclusion: CaMIB模型通过因果原则而非传统似然方法，有效缓解了数据集偏差问题，具有良好解释性和稳健性

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的工具使用策略优化主要依赖稀疏结果奖励，缺乏对工具使用任务特殊性的考虑，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低

Method: ResT方法：通过熵感知的token重加权重塑策略梯度，在训练过程中逐步增加推理token的权重，实现从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑转换

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank评估中达到最先进结果，比先前方法提升高达8.76%；在4B基础LLM上微调后，在单轮任务上超越GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮基础任务上超越1.50%

Conclusion: ResT方法通过熵感知的token级策略梯度重塑，有效解决了工具使用任务中的训练稳定性问题，显著提升了LLM作为目标导向代理的性能

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统在开放文本生成中面临输出可靠性判断的挑战，因为生成质量是连续的且存在多个有效响应。

Method: 使用语义一致性作为训练自由的延迟信号，当不同模型输出在语义层面达成共识时，将其作为比词元级置信度更强的可靠性指标。

Result: 在500M到70B参数模型上评估，语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟降低达60%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型内部信息，适用于黑盒API，对模型更新具有鲁棒性，是实际LLM部署的实用基线。

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like

trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮对话，缺乏对知识密集型多轮问答的系统评估，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 创建KnowMT-Bench基准，采用动态评估设置让模型生成多轮对话历史，使用人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实准确性和信息传递效率。

Result: 实验显示多轮上下文会降低性能：事实准确性因自生成历史的上下文噪声而下降，信息效率随对话长度增加而降低。RAG可以有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强LLM在真实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient

expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without

that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,

TL;DR: LUMINA是一个检测RAG系统中幻觉的新框架，通过量化外部上下文利用和内部知识利用来识别幻觉，无需大量超参数调优，在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统即使提供了正确和充分的上下文，仍然会产生幻觉。现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测token的演化来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比现有方法高出+13% AUROC。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持鲁棒性，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

*Thanh-Long V. Le,Myeongho Jeon,Kim Vu,Viet Lai,Eunho Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RL-ZVP是一种新的强化学习算法，能够从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注不同正确性的响应，而忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示。本文认为这些提示并非无用，而是可以提供有意义的策略优化反馈。

Method: RL-ZVP算法直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，直接奖励正确性和惩罚错误，即使没有对比响应。通过调节基于令牌级特征的反馈来保持信息丰富、细致的信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61分，通过率提升7.77分，并且持续优于过滤掉零方差提示的其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 结果表明零方差提示在RLVR中具有未开发的潜力，RL-ZVP能够有效利用这些提示提升模型推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

*Yijin Guo,Ye Shen,Farong Wen,Junying Wang,Zicheng Zhang,Qi Jia,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QoNext是首个将网络和多媒体领域的体验质量(QoE)原则应用于基础模型评估的框架，通过识别影响用户体验的因素并构建预测模型，实现主动细粒度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型评估方法仅关注输出正确性，忽视了用户交互体验的重要性，无法捕捉用户满意度的形成机制。

Method: 识别影响用户体验的因素，在受控实验中收集不同配置下的人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练预测模型。

Result: QoNext不仅实现了主动和细粒度的评估，还为产品化服务提供了优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: QoNext框架成功将QoE原则引入基础模型评估，填补了现有方法在用户体验评估方面的空白。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

### [201] [Elastic MoE: Unlocking the Inference-Time Scalability of Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21892)
*Naibin Gu,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuchen Feng,Yilong Chen,Peng Fu,Zheng Lin,Shuohuan Wang,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Weiping Wang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，解决MoE模型在推理时激活更多专家会导致性能下降的问题，通过训练专家在多样化组合中协作，显著扩展了性能可扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在训练和推理时固定激活专家数量k，直觉上推理时激活更多专家(k'>k)应提升性能，但研究发现性能反而会快速下降，这源于专家间缺乏学习到的协作。

Method: 提出EMoE训练框架，同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，使MoE模型能在推理时扩展激活专家数量而无需额外训练开销。

Result: 在各种MoE设置上的实验表明，EMoE显著扩展了有效性能扩展范围，可达训练时k的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE通过促进专家协作和路由器优化，使MoE模型能够在推理时弹性扩展计算资源，实现更广泛的计算预算下的稳健性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

TL;DR: 本文针对土耳其语等黏着性语言的引文意图分类问题，提出了系统性方法并创建了首个土耳其语引文意图数据集，通过DSPy框架自动化提示优化，结合堆叠泛化集成方法实现了91.3%的最先进准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解引文的定性意图对于学术研究评估至关重要，但土耳其语等黏着性语言在此任务上面临独特挑战，缺乏相关数据集和有效方法。

Method: 创建土耳其语引文意图数据集，使用DSPy框架构建可编程分类管道自动化提示优化，采用堆叠泛化集成方法结合XGBoost元模型进行最终分类。

Result: 提出的集成方法实现了91.3%的最先进准确率，显著优于标准上下文学习方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为土耳其NLP社区和更广泛的学术界提供了基础数据集和鲁棒的分类框架，为未来的定性引文研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多代理LLM框架，通过评分标准对齐的结构化组件识别来增强自动评分，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性低、提示敏感性和可解释性差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM作为端到端评分器面临的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性有限和评分标准对齐不足等问题，这些限制了LLM在自动评分实践中的应用。

Method: 采用双代理框架：评分标准组件提取代理从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分代理使用该表示分配最终分数，确保模型推理遵循类似人类的评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上评估，使用GPT-4o、LLaMA-3.1-8B和LLaMA-3.1-70B，AutoSCORE持续提高了评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE），在复杂多维评分标准和小型LLM上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多代理设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出了SimulSense框架，通过模拟人类口译员感知意义单元的方式，在同时语音翻译中实现更自然的读写决策，显著提升了实时效率和延迟-质量权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有同时语音翻译系统需要专门的交错训练数据和计算昂贵的LLM推理，无法像人类口译员那样自然地感知意义单元并做出读写决策。

Method: 提出SimulSense框架，通过持续读取输入语音并在感知到新的意义单元时触发写入决策来产生翻译，模仿人类口译员的工作方式。

Result: 相比两个最先进的基线系统，该方法实现了更优的质量-延迟权衡，决策速度比基线快9.6倍，实时效率显著提升。

Conclusion: SimulSense框架通过模拟人类口译员感知意义单元的方式，为同时语音翻译提供了更高效和自然的读写决策机制。

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了思维链提示在临床文本理解中的效果，发现86.3%的大型语言模型在临床任务中使用思维链后性能下降，揭示了临床领域思维链的悖论：增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床护理中的应用日益增多，但思维链提示在临床文本理解中的有效性尚未得到系统研究。临床电子健康记录具有篇幅长、碎片化和噪声多的特点，需要评估思维链在这种复杂环境中的表现。

Method: 对95个先进大语言模型在87个真实世界临床文本任务上进行系统评估，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型。通过细粒度分析推理长度、医学术语对齐和错误模式，结合LLM作为评判器和临床专家评估。

Result: 与在其他领域的发现相反，86.3%的模型在思维链设置下性能持续下降。能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱的模型性能大幅下降。思维链在临床文本任务中增强了可解释性但可能损害可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了思维链在临床上下文中的系统性失败模式，为LLM的临床推理策略提供了实证基础，强调了需要透明和可信赖的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

*Kasidit Sermsri,Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ThaiFACTUAL框架，通过反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督，在不需微调的情况下减轻泰语政治立场检测中的偏见，并发布了首个高质量的泰语政治立场数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在泰语政治环境中，由于间接语言、两极分化人物以及情感与立场纠缠，大语言模型存在系统性偏见（如情感泄露和实体偏袒），影响公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督，将情感与立场解耦，减少偏见，框架轻量且模型无关。

Result: 实验结果显示，ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并提高了多个大语言模型的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏见技术的重要性。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术创意生成方面潜力巨大，但面临创意落地困难和确认偏误的挑战，需要更有效的框架来提升创意质量。

Method: 整合动机知识图谱（存储问题、挑战和解决方案节点）和双代理苏格拉底提问系统，提供创意基础并促进严格改进过程。

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在LLM评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MotivGraph-SoIQ框架通过动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话有效提升了LLM创意生成的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性表达的简单黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLM内部状态，但在LLM外部API受限且外部资源有限的情况下，迫切需要建立有效的黑盒幻觉检测方法。

Method: 通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现LLMs生成事实性回答时会产生一致响应，而非事实性回答则不一致。基于此提出使用不确定性表达的黑盒幻觉检测指标。

Result: 实验表明，该指标在预测模型回答的事实性方面优于使用LLM内部知识的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒幻觉检测方法简单有效，能够在不依赖LLM内部状态或外部资源的情况下准确检测幻觉问题。

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法面临两个核心限制：浅层检索无法发现所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据的低效利用，这阻碍了从复杂查询中进行有效推理。

Method: GraphSearch采用模块化框架组织检索过程，包含六个模块，支持多轮交互和迭代推理。采用双通道检索策略，在基于块的文本数据上执行语义查询，在结构图数据上执行关系查询，充分利用两种模态及其互补优势。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试上的实验结果表明，GraphSearch相比传统策略持续提升了答案准确性和生成质量。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向，通过深度搜索和双通道检索有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

Motivation: 传统主题建模方法通常将异常值视为噪声而忽略，但本研究旨在探索这些异常值是否可能预示着新兴主题的出现。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集（关注企业社会责任和气候变化）中追踪异常值的时序演化。

Result: 结果显示，异常值倾向于随时间发展成连贯的主题，这一模式在两种模型和语言中均保持一致。

Conclusion: 异常值不应被简单视为噪声，而是新兴主题的早期信号，对动态文本语料库的主题演化分析具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative

news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保了稳定的推理过程，并促进了不同模型规模间的知识迁移，理论分析和实证结果均支持其有效性。

Conclusion: FRC为处理微妙和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

TL;DR: 提出了RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD检测框架，用于分析社交媒体上AI生成文本的时序动态和用户互动模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注静态AIGT检测，但社交媒体内容受用户参与度驱动且随时间演变，需要纵向数据集来研究AIGT的时序动态。

Method: 构建了5年纵向数据集RedNote-Vibe，并提出基于心理语言学特征的PLAD检测框架。

Result: PLAD在检测性能上表现优异，能提供区分人类和AI生成内容的特征洞察，并揭示语言特征与社交媒体参与度的复杂关系。

Conclusion: RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD框架为社交媒体AIGT分析提供了重要工具，有助于理解AIGT的时序动态和用户互动模式。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/testuser03158/RedNote-Vibe.

*Anya Belz,Simon Mille,Craig Thomson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET质量评估分类法，旨在解决NLP领域质量评估标准名称不统一、难以比较的问题，通过建立标准化的质量准则名称和定义体系来促进评估的可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域存在数百种质量评估标准名称，但相同名称可能评估不同质量方面，导致评估结果不可比较，阻碍了领域科学进展。需要建立标准化的质量准则分类体系来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中推导出标准质量准则名称和定义，构建层次结构分类法，其中父节点捕捉子节点的共同方面。

Result: 提出了QCET质量评估分类法及其相关资源，该分类法能够将现有数百种质量准则名称映射到标准体系中。

Conclusion: QCET分类法有三个主要用途：建立现有评估的可比性、指导新评估的设计、以及评估监管合规性，有助于解决NLP领域长期存在的评估可比性问题。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文挑战了微调不适合模型编辑的传统观点，指出失败原因在于采用了深度优先的序列化编辑流程，而非微调本身的问题。通过恢复标准的广度优先微调流程并优化调参位置，提出了LocFT-BF方法，在模型编辑任务中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为微调不适合模型编辑任务，但作者认为这种失败源于采用了不合适的深度优先编辑流程，而不是微调方法本身的问题。

Method: 1) 将微调恢复为标准广度优先（epoch-based）流程和小批量优化；2) 系统分析调参位置，提出LocFT-BF局部编辑方法。

Result: LocFT-BF在多种LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有最优方法，首次实现了10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的可持续编辑，且不损害模型通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过澄清长期误解并引入原则性的局部调优策略，将微调从被低估的基线方法提升为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过自适应选择字典原子实现更灵活的权重矩阵表示，在保持模型精度方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于低秩权重逼近的LLM压缩方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略来平衡压缩率和模型保真度。

Method: 采用结构化稀疏因子分解，将权重矩阵表示为稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的组合，利用校准数据集优化因子分解以最小化功能重构误差而非权重逼近误差。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在准确性和困惑度方面均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法，且兼容后训练量化。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的有力替代方案，为高效LLM部署提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过抽象意图表示来编码、本地化和生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译导致的翻译腔和文化不适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法通常依赖英语对话的翻译，这会引入翻译腔并降低对话的自然性和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用结构化对话行为表示，从抽象意图生成目标语言的新对话，支持跨语言的灵活本地化。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面优于机器和人工翻译的对话。

Conclusion: DAS框架能够生成更自然、文化适宜的多语言对话，有效缓解翻译腔问题。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Solve-to-Judge (S2J)方法解决生成奖励模型中的solve-to-judge差距问题，通过同时利用模型的求解和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现生成奖励模型存在显著的solve-to-judge差距现象，即模型能够解决某些问题但无法正确判断这些问题的答案，这限制了模型的判断能力。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM输出上同时利用求解和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中显式连接问题求解和评估能力。

Result: S2J有效减少solve-to-judge差距16.2%，提升判断性能5.8%，在使用更小训练数据集的情况下达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: S2J通过自进化方式成功缩小solve-to-judge差距，无需依赖更强大的外部模型进行蒸馏，显著提升了生成奖励模型的判断能力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展（TTS）的方法，通过训练验证器模型（VERIFIERFC）来改进LLMs对复杂数值声明的事实核查能力，解决了推理漂移问题并提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型在事实核查复杂数值声明时存在不足，特别是在组合推理和数值推理方面，容易产生推理漂移问题，无法正确理解数值方面的细微差别。

Method: 采用测试时计算扩展（TTS）策略，从LLM中引出多个推理路径，并训练验证器模型VERIFIERFC来选择最可能导致正确判断的推理路径。同时引入自适应机制，根据声明的感知复杂度选择性执行TTS。

Result: TTS方法显著缓解了推理漂移问题，在数值声明事实核查任务上取得了显著性能提升。自适应TTS方法比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，相比单次声明验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型是改进LLMs事实核查能力的有效方法，特别是在处理需要组合推理和数值推理的复杂数值声明时。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our
code and data can be found at https://github.com/VenkteshV/VerifierFC

TL;DR: Uni-LAP是一个通用的法律条文预测框架，通过结合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势来解决法律条文预测任务中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在法律条文预测任务中存在局限性：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂的事实模式，大型语言模型在预测场景中表现不佳，且不同司法管辖区的法律系统多样性导致方法缺乏普适性。

Method: 提出Uni-LAP框架，通过紧密协作整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势。监督分类模型采用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，大型语言模型使用三段论推理来优化最终预测。

Result: 在多个司法管辖区数据集上的评估表明，Uni-LAP方法持续优于现有基线方法，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP框架成功解决了法律条文预测任务中的关键挑战，通过整合不同模型的优势实现了更好的性能和跨司法管辖区的普适性。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text

encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型或定制领域特定模型无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域进行优化。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到多个本体（FoodOn、SNOMED-CT、Hansard分类法），并采用微调方法提升性能。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本提示基线相比表现出优越性能，在某些本体和数据集上F1分数达到98%。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline

TL;DR: 提出Reasoning Capsule框架，通过将推理计划压缩为少量潜在标记来平衡效率和可解释性，减少CoT的冗长问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT提示虽然能提升LLMs的复杂推理能力，但其冗长性增加了延迟和内存使用，且可能传播早期错误。需要一种结合潜在推理效率和显式CoT透明性的方法。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，将高层推理计划压缩为少量学习到的潜在标记（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量或显式。使用双重目标：主要任务损失和辅助计划重建损失。

Result: 在保持或提高复杂基准测试准确性的同时，显著减少了推理的可见标记足迹。

Conclusion: R-Capsule框架在效率、准确性和可解释性之间取得了平衡，为LLMs的复杂推理提供了更优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

TL;DR: GTO通过对齐训练与解码时的树策略来解决推测解码中的策略不对齐问题，使用采样自由的目标函数和基于组的策略训练，显著提高接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练目标只优化单一路径，而解码时采用树策略验证多个分支，这种策略不对齐限制了推测解码的加速效果。

Method: 提出Group Tree Optimization (GTO)，包含两个组件：(1) Draft Tree Reward：采样自由的目标函数，衡量在目标模型下草稿树的期望接受长度；(2) Group-based Draft Policy Training：稳定的优化方案，对比当前和参考草稿模型的树，形成去偏的组标准化优势，并沿最长接受序列应用PPO风格代理进行稳健更新。

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务上，以及多个LLM模型上，GTO将接受长度提高了7.4%，相比之前最先进的EAGLE-3实现了额外的7.7%加速。

Conclusion: 通过弥合草稿策略不对齐，GTO为高效LLM推理提供了一个实用、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MACC框架通过多轮自适应压缩CoT推理链，利用token弹性现象，在保持准确性的同时显著减少推理延迟和token长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但因其冗长性导致推理延迟显著增加，需要一种高效的压缩方法。

Method: 提出多轮自适应CoT压缩框架，利用token弹性现象，通过多轮精炼逐步压缩CoT，为每个输入确定最优压缩深度。

Result: 相比最先进基线方法，平均准确率提升5.6%，CoT长度平均减少47个token，显著降低延迟。

Conclusion: CoT压缩既有效又可预测，通过可解释特征如困惑度和压缩率可可靠预测测试时性能，支持高效模型选择而无需重复微调。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在创造力方面接近甚至超越人类，需要研究如何检测机器生成文本以保护人类创造力和创新能力的真实性。

Method: 引入BMAS English数据集，支持多种检测任务：文档级二元分类（人机文本区分）、多元分类（识别具体生成器）、句子级分割（识别人机协作文本边界）和对抗攻击研究。

Result: 开发了一个综合性的数据集和检测框架，能够更全面地解决机器生成文本检测问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作为机器生成文本检测领域提供了更全面的解决方案，有望在该领域产生重要影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

*Josip Jukić,Martin Tutek,Jan Šnajder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompAs是一个元学习框架，通过组合式结构将上下文转换为适配器参数，使适配器能够代数合并，从而高效集成多个信息块，降低推理成本并解决长上下文问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如上下文学习和监督微调存在效率低、灵活性差的问题，需要一种能整合多个信息块的高效替代方案。

Method: 提出CompAs框架，通过元学习将指令或演示从上下文直接映射到具有组合结构的适配器参数，支持代数合并而无需重新处理长提示。

Result: 在多项选择和抽取式问答任务上，CompAs优于上下文学习和先前基于生成器的方法，特别是在扩展到更多输入时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了实用高效的替代方案，具有低推理成本、长上下文鲁棒性和可逆编码等优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过合成数据蒸馏框架系统比较了指令微调(IFT)和推理模型在不同规模下的表现，发现推理模型在数学和通用任务上能匹配或超越更大规模的IFT系统，且随着模型规模增大，推理模型在推理密集型任务上的优势更加明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管具备推理能力的大语言模型在众多任务上取得了最优表现，但推理能力在哪些任务和模型规模下真正有效，以及其训练和推理成本如何，这些问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用合成数据蒸馏框架进行大规模监督研究，比较不同规模的指令微调(IFT)和推理模型，在数学中心和通用任务上进行评估，包括多项选择和开放式格式。

Result: 推理持续提升模型性能，经常匹配或超越显著更大的IFT系统。虽然IFT在训练和推理成本方面保持帕累托最优，但随着模型规模增大，推理模型在推理密集型和开放式任务上变得更有价值，能够克服IFT的性能限制。

Conclusion: 推理模型在大型模型上展现出显著优势，特别是在需要复杂推理的任务中，为模型架构选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

TL;DR: 论文论证大语言模型（LLM）的输出是无意义的，因为LLM缺乏产生字面意义所需的意图类型，且无法拥有合适的意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型输出是否具有真正意义，分析意图在语义生成中的关键作用。

Method: 基于两个关键前提构建论证：(a)特定意图是LLM输出具有字面意义的必要条件；(b)LLM无法拥有合适意图。并反驳语义外在主义和内在主义的反对观点。

Result: 论证了LLM输出缺乏字面意义，但承认这些输出在表面上显得有意义，并能用于获取真信念和知识。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM输出在严格意义上无意义，但其表面意义和实用性仍然存在，这需要进一步解释。

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RTP框架，利用LLM构建二进制树进行文本语料库的无监督分析，每个节点是自然语言问题，生成可解释的分类法，比传统主题模型更易理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳，且通常用关键词列表描述聚类，需要大量人工解释且缺乏语义连贯性。

Method: RTP框架利用LLM交互式构建二进制树，每个节点是自然语言问题，语义上分割数据，形成完全可解释的分类法。

Result: 实验显示RTP的问题驱动层次比BERTopic等基线方法的关键词主题更易解释，且在数据主题与任务标签相关时，这些聚类可作为下游分类任务的强大特征。

Conclusion: RTP引入了数据探索的新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，其主题路径可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库特定特征的一致模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有的语义语音分词器对不相关的声音扰动非常脆弱，导致下游LLM学习负担增加。本文提出StableToken，通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定的分词输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义语音分词器在即使语音可懂度很高的高信噪比条件下，对不相关的声学扰动也很脆弱，导致输出标记序列剧烈变化，增加了下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 提出StableToken分词器，采用多分支架构并行处理音频，通过强大的位级投票机制合并这些表示，形成单一稳定的标记序列。

Result: StableToken在标记稳定性方面达到新的最先进水平，在各种噪声条件下显著降低单元编辑距离（UED）。这种基础稳定性直接转化为下游效益，显著提高了SpeechLLM在各种任务上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StableToken通过共识驱动机制解决了现有语音分词器的脆弱性问题，为下游语音语言模型提供了更稳定的基础。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Composite Reasoning方法，让LLMs能够动态结合多种推理风格（演绎、归纳、溯因等），在科学和医学问答任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs依赖单一推理范式，难以处理需要多种认知策略的复杂问题，限制了其性能表现。

Method: Composite Reasoning方法，使LLMs能够动态探索和结合多种推理风格，包括演绎、归纳、溯因推理等。

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，该方法超越了Chain-of-Thought和DeepSeek-R1等基线方法，展现出更好的样本效率和适当的token使用。

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，LLMs能够获得更强大、自适应和高效的问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出逆向投机解码(RSD)方法，通过让教师模型生成候选token但由学生模型根据自身概率分布决定接受与否，解决了大模型向小模型知识迁移时因分布不对齐导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大模型向小模型的知识迁移方法往往适得其反，性能反而下降。研究发现这是因为大模型生成的推理轨迹中包含学生模型分布中低概率的token，超出了小模型的内部表示能力。

Method: 提出逆向投机解码(RSD)机制：教师模型生成候选token，但由学生模型根据自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉低概率token，生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，直接蒸馏s1K-1.1推理轨迹数据使Qwen3-0.6B在主要推理基准上的平均性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练同一模型则实现了4.9%的有意义改进。

Conclusion: 低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈，RSD方法有效解决了这一问题，但RSD生成的轨迹具有模型特异性，分布对齐需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试与vibe coding范式不匹配，要么需要代码级规范，要么只关注问题解决，忽视了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，具有纯自然语言提示、严格的数据收集流程、全面的测试用例和多样化的应用领域等特征。

Result: 评估显示vibe coding范式下的功能实现具有挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%，并发现了"激进实现"策略的现象。

Conclusion: FeatBench为社区研究提供了新的基准测试工具，揭示了vibe coding范式下功能实现的挑战性和独特现象。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法依赖临时分类法，缺乏系统化保护，无法确保现代LLM系统复杂行为的安全性。需要从法律合规角度建立严谨的安全标准。

Method: 1) 基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR法律框架构建安全合规基准；2) 使用Group Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建安全推理器Compliance Reasoner。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，在欧盟AI法案上平均提升10.45%，在GDPR上平均提升11.85%。

Conclusion: 从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题是有效的，建立的Compliance Reasoner能够显著提升LLM的安全合规能力。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的大语言模型架构，旨在有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息到LLM的推理过程中，通过KGR、KGE和KGA模块解决知识图谱结构信息利用不足和嵌入空间不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM处理幻觉问题的主要方法是将知识图谱作为纯文本使用，仅提取语义信息而忽略了知识图谱的关键结构方面，且知识图谱编码器和LLM文本嵌入空间存在差距，阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: 提出SSKG-LLM模型架构，包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块和知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来保持语义同时利用结构，然后通过知识图谱适配(KGA)模块使LLM能够理解知识图谱嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛实验和详细分析，探索了整合知识图谱结构信息如何增强LLM的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM能够有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息，显著提升大语言模型的事实推理能力，解决了现有方法在利用知识图谱结构信息和嵌入空间匹配方面的局限性。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型会复制训练数据中的社会偏见，但黑盒特性使得用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP中可解释性的研究多为定性分析，缺乏大规模定量研究。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中系统研究可解释性与公平性的关系，关注编码器和仅解码器模型，考察三个维度：识别偏见预测、选择公平模型、训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为有用的监督信号在训练中减少偏见，但在候选模型中选择公平模型方面不可靠。

Conclusion: 可解释性工具在识别和缓解NLP模型偏见方面具有实用价值，但在模型公平性评估方面需要谨慎使用。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Motivation: 自动化自然语言到一阶逻辑的翻译对于知识表示和形式方法至关重要，但仍然是挑战。

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调的Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1-0528模型以及符号系统ccg2lambda。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同规模的Transformer模型在训练中学习传递关系推理的能力，发现模型能够学习网格状有向图的连通性，但难以处理包含多个不连通分量的非网格图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer模型从训练示例中学习传递关系推理的能力，以及模型规模对这种能力的影响，这在因果推理等场景中至关重要。

Method: 生成有向图来训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在各种图大小下推断传递关系的能力。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维子空间中可嵌入节点的网格状有向图的连通性，高维网格图比低维网格图更具挑战性。增加模型规模能改善对网格图连通性的泛化能力，但对于包含多个不连通分量的非网格图，模型学习困难。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习网格状有向图的传递关系推理，模型规模对此有积极影响，但对于复杂非网格图的连通性学习仍存在挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim at the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques to historical research endeavors, particularly addressing the study
of religious invectives in the context of the Protestant Reformation in Tudor
England. We outline a workflow spanning from raw data, through pre-processing

(EModE) sentences, which are enriched with expert annotations regarding
invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), which highlights the
superiority of models pre-trained on historical data and fine-tuned to

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏长期时间结构，限制了LLM理解语言语义和规范演变的能力，需要支持历时变化分析和训练的资源。

Method: 从古腾堡计划中整理英语书籍文本，构建时间结构化语料库，通过时间敏感的VAD分析量化词汇语义变化，构建历史校准的情感词典。

Result: 展示了现代LLM工具在检测歧视性语言和跨时期情感语境化方面的不足，语言模型在CHRONOBERG上顺序训练时难以编码历时意义变化。

Conclusion: 需要时间感知的训练和评估流程，CHRONOBERG作为可扩展资源支持语言变化研究和时间泛化研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes
language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers. Open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中的非结构化文本包含大量运维情报，但传统定量可靠性分析无法有效利用这些信息。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在分类层面，无法进行复杂推理。

Method: 提出一个探索性框架，利用大型语言模型进行深度语义分析，包括故障模式识别、因果链推理、站点比较分析和数据质量审计四个工作流程。

Result: LLMs能够作为强大的"可靠性协作者"，超越标签分类，综合文本信息并生成可操作的专家级假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为使用LLMs作为推理工具提供了新颖且可重复的方法论，为风能行业解锁非结构化数据中的隐藏洞察提供了新途径。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了OLMO2训练数据中的政治偏见，发现左倾文档在训练数据中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的政治偏见密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型已知会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见如何产生尚不清楚。当前LLM研究中训练数据的政治内容分析不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 分析OLMO2开源模型的训练前后语料库，随机抽取大样本，自动标注文档政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，评估训练数据政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料比后训练数据包含更多政治参与内容；左右倾文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源框架相似主题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见强相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据管理流程中整合政治内容分析，并详细记录过滤策略以提高透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Chimera测试套件，包含7,500个高质量图表，用于评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现现有模型主要依赖知识回忆和Clever-Hans捷径，而非真正的图表理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表相关基准测试中表现良好，但其是否真正理解和推理图表内容存在疑问，因为模型可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径。

Method: 构建Chimera测试套件，包含7,500个维基百科图表，每个图表都用语义三元组标注符号内容，并设计多层次问题评估实体识别、关系理解、知识基础和视觉推理四个基本方面。

Result: 评估15个开源视觉语言模型发现，其看似强大的性能主要来自捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响较小，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在复杂视觉输入（如图表）的真实理解方面存在严重局限性，需要更稳健的评估协议来基准测试真正的理解能力而非问答捷径。

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答问题的方法，在抽取式QA任务中有效识别无答案问题，并能泛化到其他不可回答场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常在缺乏足够信息时仍自信回答，导致幻觉答案。需要解决不可回答性检测问题，特别是在抽取式QA中判断段落是否包含足够信息来回答问题。

Method: 在模型激活空间中识别捕获不可回答性的方向，通过在推理时应用激活加法并测量其对模型弃权行为的影响来选择该方向。将隐藏激活投影到此方向获得可靠的不可回答性分类分数。

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准测试中，该方法能有效检测不可回答问题，在跨数据集泛化方面优于现有的基于提示和分类器的方法。该方向还能扩展到其他不可回答场景。

Conclusion: 通过因果干预证明，添加或消融该方向能有效控制模型的弃权行为，为LLM的不可回答性检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

TL;DR: 本文评估了LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM构成显著挑战，准确率通常低于50%，而通用任务可达70%以上。Gemini平均比LLaMA表现好约24个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLM主导的时代，理解其在法律等高风险领域的能力和限制至关重要。目前对LLM在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境中的表现研究不足。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，在多语言法律和非法律基准上评估LLaMA和Gemini，通过字符和词级扰动测试其对抗鲁棒性，并开发了开源模块化评估流水线。

Result: 法律推理任务准确率通常低于50%（如LEXam），而通用任务（如XNLI）可达70%以上。英语结果更稳定但不总是更准确。提示敏感性和对抗脆弱性在所有语言中持续存在。语言表现与其与英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新版LLM有所改进，但在关键的多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升LLM在法律领域的表现和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Result: 研究发现解决方案分歧与问题解决能力正相关，使用该指标能持续提高成功率。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进LLM的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高度可解释的LLM表示，具有卓越的可扩展性和实时适应性，能够有效应对动态扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art

TL;DR: AMBS提出了一种两阶段1对N框架，通过共享表示和并行分支策略，在保持跨目标一致性的同时实现多目标对齐，解决了传统方法中的灾难性遗忘和推理碎片化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐方法存在灾难性遗忘（优化一个目标会覆盖其他目标）和推理碎片化（多目标输出不一致）的问题，需要一种统一高效的多目标对齐框架。

Method: 两阶段1对N框架：阶段I计算共享的Transformer层后注意力隐藏状态；阶段II克隆表示到并行分支，通过策略参考机制进行目标特定控制。

Result: 在Alpaca、BeaverTails和TruthfulQA上的实验表明，AMBS在多个7B LLM骨干上持续改进HHH对齐。在DeepSeek-7B上，平均对齐分数提升+32.4%，不安全输出减少11.0%。

Conclusion: AMBS能够有效实现多目标对齐，在保持跨目标一致性的同时提升性能，与最先进方法相比具有竞争力。

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的FP8训练方法，通过细粒度混合粒度量化策略，在保持数值保真度的同时显著提升训练效率，相比BF16基线减少22%训练时间、14%内存使用和19%吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本是创新的主要障碍，FP8训练虽有理论效率优势但缺乏开源训练方案，阻碍了其广泛应用。

Method: 采用端到端FP8训练方法，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合粒度量化策略来平衡数值精度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方法不仅稳定性好且基本无损，在推理基准测试中性能与BF16基线相当，同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布相关代码以促进大规模模型训练的民主化。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Cognitive Reasoning范式，将社会认知建模为结构化认知流，并开发CogFlow框架通过监督微调和强化学习提升LLM的社会推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逻辑推理范式不适用于社会情境，因为社会情境涉及模糊线索的解读过程，很少产生明确结果。

Method: CogFlow框架：1)通过树状规划模拟人类思维生成认知流数据集；2)监督微调培养基本认知推理能力；3)强化学习优化认知流和响应质量。

Result: 实验表明CogFlow有效增强LLM和人类的社会认知能力，带来更有效的社会决策。

Conclusion: Cognitive Reasoning范式成功弥补了逻辑推理在社会情境中的不足，CogFlow框架为提升社会认知能力提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

TL;DR: 开发了一个检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，用于评估LLM生成的医疗消息回复草稿质量，通过引入临床错误本体论和利用历史消息对作为参考，显著提高了错误检测的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录门户中的异步患者-临床医生消息增加了临床医生的工作量，促使使用LLM生成回复草稿。但LLM输出可能存在临床不准确、遗漏或语气不匹配等问题，因此需要稳健的评估方法。

Method: 1) 开发包含5个领域和59个粒度错误代码的临床错误本体论；2) 构建检索增强评估管道(RAEC)，利用语义相似的历史消息-回复对提高判断质量；3) 使用DSPy的两阶段提示架构实现可扩展、可解释的分层错误检测。

Result: 在1,500多条患者消息上的测试显示，检索上下文改善了临床完整性和工作流程适当性等领域的错误识别。在100条消息上的人工验证表明，上下文增强标签相比基线具有更高的协议一致性(50% vs. 33%)和性能(F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256)。

Conclusion: RAEC管道可作为患者消息的AI防护栏，通过参考历史消息对显著提高了LLM生成回复的评估质量，支持在临床环境中安全部署AI助手。

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了LLMs在定位上下文幻觉（模型输出中无法从源文本验证的信息）方面的能力，构建了一个包含1000多个示例的基准测试，并提出了基于自由文本描述的新表示方法。研究发现最佳模型的F1分数仅为0.67，揭示了LLMs在该任务中的主要挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs定位上下文幻觉的适用性，作为现有复杂评估流程的更实用替代方案。由于缺乏针对幻觉定位元评估的基准测试，需要构建专门为LLMs定制的基准。

Method: 构建了包含1000多个示例的基准测试，采用人类标注；提出了基于自由文本描述的幻觉表示方法；评估了四个大规模LLMs；分析了最优提示策略。

Result: 基准测试具有挑战性，最佳模型仅达到0.67的F1分数；发现LLMs倾向于错误地将缺失细节标记为不一致，且难以处理包含模型参数知识但源文本中不存在的事实信息。

Conclusion: LLMs在定位上下文幻觉方面能力有限，主要挑战包括对缺失细节的错误分类和处理与模型参数知识一致但源文本中不存在的信息的困难。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

Motivation: 为自然语言结构建模提供一个严格且可解释的基础，验证亚正则层次结构在语言建模中的适用性。

Method: 使用判定谓词表示亚正则语言类，通过线性模型进行学习，并在合成数据和真实数据（英语形态学）上进行实验验证。

Result: 在无噪声条件下实现了完美可分性，真实数据实验显示学习到的特征与已知语言约束一致。

Conclusion: 亚正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严格且可解释的基础，证明了其在线性可分性和可学习性方面的优势。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable
when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite
observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP基准测试中性能分数的实验变异性来自模型和数据两方面，需要同时考虑这两者以避免低估整体变异性。

Method: 使用重采样方法，在多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等任务中计算排行榜中各种统计量的抽样分布。

Result: 展示了重采样方法能够有效计算平均值/中位数、模型间成对差异和排名等排行榜常用统计量的抽样分布。

Conclusion: 重采样方法是量化NLP基准测试中评估指标不确定性的有效工具，能更准确地反映性能变异性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种通过后训练高效扩展预训练循环神经网络状态大小的训练流程，能够增强RNN的长上下文召回和上下文学习能力，而不会显著增加参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在处理长上下文时计算成本高，而现有的循环神经网络（如线性注意力和状态空间模型）虽然计算效率高，但由于恒定大小的循环状态限制，在长上下文信息召回方面表现不佳。

Method: 针对线性注意力和状态空间模型两类流行RNN，设计了后训练架构修改来扩展状态大小，几乎不增加模型参数。

Result: 在高达13亿参数的模型上实验表明，StateX有效提升了RNN的召回和上下文学习能力，且后训练成本低，不影响其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文处理中的局限性，同时保持了计算效率优势。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言模型提供原则性的概率视角，统一变分推理与强化学习方法，改进模型的推理能力。

Method: 从证据下界(ELBO)出发，扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式来稳定变分后验的训练，将拒绝采样微调和二元奖励强化学习解释为局部前向KL目标。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上广泛验证了该方法在各种推理任务上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一变分推理与强化学习风格方法的概率视角，为改进语言模型推理能力提供了稳定的目标函数。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略（FCP），将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过最大似然训练和在线自举阶段让LLM直接从语言反馈中学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富的语言反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息丢失和尺度不平衡问题。

Method: FCP从响应-反馈对中学习，通过最大似然训练近似反馈条件后验分布，并开发在线自举阶段让策略在积极条件下生成并接收新反馈进行优化。

Result: 将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLM提供更丰富的方式直接从语言反馈中学习。

Conclusion: FCP框架为LLM学习语言反馈提供了更富表现力的方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究发现n-gram新颖性作为创造力评估指标的局限性，指出创造力需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性，而仅靠n-gram新颖性会高估91%的top-quartile表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是验证n-gram新颖性作为创造力评估指标的充分性，因为创造力理论强调需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性两个维度。

Method: 通过7542个专家作家注释，对人工和AI生成文本的新颖性、实用性和合理性进行细读评估，并测试不同LLM模型识别创造性表达的能力。

Result: 发现n-gram新颖性与专家评定的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的；开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性会降低实用性；前沿闭源模型产生创造性表达的可能性低于人类。

Conclusion: n-gram新颖性不应单独用作创造力评估指标，LLM在识别创造性表达方面有改进空间，特别是识别非实用性表达方面表现较差。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码生成代理在网站代码库生成任务中仅依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际质量，特别是视觉效果和用户交互方面。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，使用视觉语言模型分析网站截图生成详细描述和建议，结合GUI代理测试提供质量评分，采用回溯和择优机制，并引入Step-GRPO训练方法利用视觉评分作为过程监督信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升至51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升至3.9；Step-GRPO训练将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的准确率从38.9%提升至45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升至3.7。

Conclusion: WebGen-Agent通过综合视觉反馈机制显著提升了网站生成的质量和准确性，证明了视觉反馈在代码生成任务中的重要性，为基于LLM的代理系统提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using

TL;DR: VoiceAssistant-Eval是一个全面的语音助手评估基准，包含10,497个样本，涵盖13个任务类别，用于评估AI助手在听、说、看三个维度的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估语音AI助手的全面能力，需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含10,497个样本的基准，涵盖自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及异质图像的视觉任务。评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio。

Result: 发现专有模型并非普遍优于开源模型；大多数模型擅长说话任务但在音频理解方面落后；设计良好的小模型可以匹敌大模型。Step-Audio-2-mini(7B)的听力准确率是LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual的两倍以上。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态输入和角色扮演任务上仍有困难，在鲁棒性和安全对齐方面存在显著差距。VoiceAssistant-Eval为下一代AI助手的开发提供了严格的评估框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at
https://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .

### [269] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器检测真实模型行为而非表面诱导伪影的能力，并提出了三种缓解策略来应对诱导信息泄露导致监控器性能虚高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练和评估白盒监控器需要包含目标行为的响应样本，但用于诱导行为的信息会泄露到监控器输入数据中，导致其性能被夸大。需要区分监控器检测的是真实模型行为还是诱导伪影。

Method: 提出了三种评估策略：内容过滤（移除输入中的欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token的分数）、以及提示蒸馏微调模型生物（训练模型在没有明确提示的情况下表现出欺骗行为）。

Result: 实验发现内容过滤能平滑移除诱导信号，使探针AUROC降低30%；分数过滤使AUROC降低15%；微调模型生物改进了监控器评估但使其性能下降高达40%。

Conclusion: 识别了两种导致监控器性能虚高的泄露形式：诱导泄露和推理泄露，提出的缓解策略能更准确地评估监控器检测真实模型行为的能力。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模验证链式思维推理轨迹的问题，现有方法难以有效验证LLM的中间思考过程。

Method: 提出决策支点作为可验证检查点，通过采样多样推理路径、挖掘共享支点、压缩为支点聚焦的短路径推理，并进行自我训练。

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 决策支点方法能够有效对齐推理过程，无需真实推理数据或外部评估指标。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候数据科学面临数据源分散、格式异构和技术门槛高的挑战，限制了参与度、减缓了发现速度并降低了科学工作流的可重复性。

Method: 将精心策划的知识图谱与为云原生科学工作流设计的AI代理相结合，知识图谱提供统一的数据集、工具和工作流组织层，AI代理通过生成式AI服务实现自然语言交互、自动化数据访问和简化分析。

Conclusion: 该方法为民主化气候数据访问和建立可重复、可扩展的人类-AI协作科学研究框架开辟了道路。

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

TL;DR: 比较使用EEG数据预测消费者行为的传统机器学习模型和图神经网络模型，发现GNN在某些基础标准上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要，EEG数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息来帮助分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集中提取和清理EEG特征，为GNN模型创建大脑连接特征，使用包括传统模型和不同架构的GNN模型进行比较。

Result: 整体结果没有显著差异，但GNN模型在某些传统模型表现不佳的基础标准上表现更好。

Conclusion: EEG信号分析与机器学习模型结合可以更深入理解消费者行为，并提供了传统模型与GNN模型在神经营销领域的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoEvolve是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过结合进化搜索和地理空间领域知识来自动设计和优化地理空间算法，在空间插值和不确定性量化任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的算法发现框架缺乏地理空间领域知识和多步推理能力，难以解决复杂的地理空间问题，需要开发能够注入地理学理论先验的自动化算法设计框架。

Method: 采用双层循环结构：内循环使用代码进化器生成和变异候选解，外循环通过智能体控制器评估全局精英，并查询GeoKnowRAG模块（结构化地理空间知识库）来注入地理学理论先验，实现知识引导的进化搜索。

Result: 在空间插值（克里金法）和空间不确定性量化（地理空间保形预测）任务中，GeoEvolve自动改进和发现了新算法，将空间插值误差（RMSE）降低了13-21%，不确定性估计性能提升了17%。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展的路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机会，领域引导的检索对于稳定、高质量的进化至关重要。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，通过整合临床变量和CT影像来自动化生存分析，在头颈癌数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求增加，准确且可解释的生存分析在肿瘤学中仍然是一个核心挑战。

Method: 使用深度学习推断生存相关特征：影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式。风险估计采用透明的Cox回归，实现不同生存结局的分层。

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX实现了C-index为0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法，并与已知预后标志物一致。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力，MultiFIX框架有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了语义F1分数，这是一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签和真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标将语义相关的预测视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注者分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。需要一种能够给予语义相关但不完全相同标签部分信用的评估方法。

Method: 通过引入标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，采用新颖的两步精度-召回公式，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似标签即可比较任意大小的标签集。

Result: 语义F1分数在理论和实证验证中表现出更好的可解释性和生态效度，能够更公平地评估模型性能，认识到类别重叠、标注者分歧以及相似预测导致相似结果的事实。

Conclusion: 语义F1分数是一种适用于跨任务和模态的评估指标，只需要领域适当的相似度矩阵而非严格的本体论，对错误设定具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，利用预训练ASR模型优化低资源语言TTS系统，显著提升语音质量和说话人一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言缺乏配对文本-语音数据的问题，利用更易获得的ASR模型来改进TTS系统

Method: 1) 使用IPA训练多语言TTS基础模型；2) 在有限配对数据上微调；3) 应用GRPO仅使用非配对文本和说话人提示进行优化

Result: 在低资源语言中产生清晰可懂且说话人一致的语音，显著优于单独微调；在高资源语言中也优于DPO等方法

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效利用ASR等预训练模型提升TTS性能，特别适用于数据稀缺场景

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这增加了延迟和成本，因此需要推理时效率优化。

Method: 提出检索思维(RoT)方法，将推理步骤组织成思维图，通过语义和顺序边进行快速检索和灵活重组，在推理时应用奖励引导遍历来组装问题特定模板。

Result: RoT在多个模型上评估，结果显示输出token减少达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索构建动态模板，为高效大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出LLR-BC框架解决神经VRP求解器在终身学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过行为整合方法在新任务训练时保持先前知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器在遇到新任务时，要么依赖零样本泛化（性能可能不佳），要么通过微调导致灾难性遗忘。需要一种能够持续学习多个任务而不遗忘先前知识的终身学习范式。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策寻求的方式将新任务训练求解器的行为与缓冲区中的行为对齐，并为置信度较低的决策分配更大的整合权重。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的大量实验表明，LLR-BC能够有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘问题，保持可塑性并提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在多任务序列中持续学习而不遗忘先前知识。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准，用于评估自主智能体在长视野、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，发现LLM智能体在这些复杂任务中表现不佳，与人类存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中许多关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）需要在长视野、部分可观测环境下进行，缺乏系统性评估这些能力的基准。

Method: 通过探索作为统一任务，在三个不同环境中设计长视野发现任务，智能体需要通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400+工具调用，标准配置也超过3.5万token和60+工具调用。实验显示LLM智能体表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 智能体在长视野能力上存在持续差距，简单扩展无法解决这些问题。分析识别出8种错误类型，归因于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距两个主要原因。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

*Junliang Liu,Jingyu Xiao,Wenxin Tang,Wenxuan Wang,Zhixian Wang,Minrui Zhang,Shuanghe Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了WebRSSBench基准，用于全面评估多模态大语言模型在网页理解中的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力，包含8个任务和3799个问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力的评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含8个任务的基准，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和结合自动检查与人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估12个MLLM显示模型在组合推理、跨元素推理、面对UI扰动时的鲁棒性以及识别安全关键操作方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 需要开发更强大的MLLM来应对复杂网页应用中的推理、鲁棒性和安全性挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is
available at https://github.com/jinliang-byte/webssrbench.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一个基于人类认知循环（思考、对齐、反思）的新型GUI代理框架，通过应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐和状态反思机制，在无需复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下显著提升MLLMs在GUI任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理方法面临数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等关键挑战，需要更有效的认知框架来提升自动化任务的可靠性和效率。

Method: 提出D-Artemis框架，包含：1）细粒度应用特定提示检索机制；2）预执行对齐阶段（TAC检查和ACA）；3）后执行状态反思代理（SRA），形成完整的认知循环。

Result: 在两个主要基准测试中达到SOTA性能：AndroidWorld上75.8%成功率，ScreenSpot-V2上96.8%成功率。消融研究证明各组件均有显著贡献。

Conclusion: D-Artemis通过模拟人类认知循环，在不依赖复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下，有效增强了通用MLLMs在GUI任务中的能力，展现了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

TL;DR: ProRe是一个主动奖励系统，通过通用推理器和领域特定评估器主动与环境交互来收集额外观察，显著提升了GUI智能体的奖励准确性和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为通常无法获取真实轨迹或应用数据库，而基于静态轨迹的LLM-as-a-Judge方法准确率有限。

Method: 提出ProRe系统，包含通用推理器和领域特定评估器。推理器调度有针对性的状态探测任务，评估器通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察，使推理器能够分配更准确和可验证的奖励。

Result: 在超过3000条轨迹上的实证结果显示，ProRe将奖励准确率和F1分数分别提高了5.3%和19.4%。与最先进策略智能体集成后，成功率提高了22.4%。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动与环境交互收集额外观察的方法，显著提升了GUI智能体的奖励评估准确性和任务执行成功率。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DS-STAR是一个新型数据科学智能体，通过自动数据文件分析、LLM验证步骤和顺序规划机制，解决了LLM在处理异构数据格式和生成分析计划时的困难，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务复杂，涉及多数据源探索和综合分析，但LLM在处理异构数据格式和验证分析计划充分性方面存在困难，需要更好的自动化解决方案。

Method: DS-STAR包含三个核心组件：(1) 数据文件分析模块自动探索和提取各种数据格式的上下文；(2) LLM验证步骤评估分析计划的充分性；(3) 顺序规划机制从简单可执行计划开始，基于反馈迭代优化直到验证通过。

Result: 在DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code三个基准测试中，DS-STAR实现了最先进的性能，特别是在需要处理多个异构数据文件的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过其迭代验证和规划机制，能够可靠地处理涉及多样化数据源的复杂分析任务，为数据科学自动化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究决策公理（如伦理约束）在决策建模中的作用，探索公理在决策制定和评估中的结构性差异。

Method: 引入基于公理的决策建模框架，定义决策公理的结构分类学，分析决策-评估悖论的理论基础。

Result: 发现决策公理在制定决策和评估决策之间存在结构性张力，即决策-评估悖论，该悖论在现实公理结构中普遍存在。

Conclusion: 在基于决策数据训练模型或应用公理进行决策和评估时，必须格外谨慎，以避免决策-评估悖论带来的问题。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Conclusion: DeepTravel框架成功构建了自主旅行规划代理，通过强化学习和分层奖励系统显著提升了代理能力，使小型模型在旅行规划任务中超越大型前沿模型。

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Motivation: 当前LLM多智能体系统研究缺乏受控实验的原则性方法，限制了涌现行为研究的进展。

Method: 提出Shachi框架，将智能体策略分解为配置（内在特质）、记忆（上下文持久性）和工具（扩展能力）三个核心组件，由LLM推理引擎协调。

Conclusion: 该工作为构建和评估LLM智能体提供了严谨的开源基础，旨在促进更具累积性和科学基础的研究。

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: TRACE提出了一个新的图表示学习范式，通过层次化Transformer架构和函数偏移学习目标来解决计算图功能建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流消息传递神经网络和Transformer在图计算任务中存在架构不匹配问题，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性。

Method: 1. 使用层次化Transformer模拟计算的逐步流程；2. 引入函数偏移学习目标，预测真实全局函数与局部近似之间的差异。

Result: 在电子电路等复杂计算图上，TRACE在综合基准测试中显著优于所有现有架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的骨干网络和解耦学习目标为图计算学习提供了更鲁棒的范式。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在扰动下实现了长期可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现ML方法在准确性上优于SPM，而两种方法在可解释性方面都获得了专家认可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其鲁棒异常检测能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用来自多个中心的数据，通过专家共识标注并添加合成异常，共798个有效样本和2000个异常值。评估了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: ML模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常值。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM被认为复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释ML在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，强调了在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策时，可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理的潜力，导致不一致的计划和冗余通信，降低了协作效率。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，使用符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，通过LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新，主动检测潜在的不协调并自适应通信。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，相比最强基线，通信成本减少22-60%，任务完成效率提高4-28%。

Conclusion: 显式的、意图感知的信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统中实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理所需的复杂多步交互和动态内容，需要新的解决方案。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集、RISK-Bench基准测试和RISK-R1强化微调框架，后者通过输出格式、单步级、多步级和任务级四个方面的优化来提升性能。

Result: RISK-R1在离线单步任务中提升6.8%，离线多步任务中提升8.8%，在线评估中达到70.5%的最高任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网络交互提供了可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推动了电子商务风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to

### [294] [Bilinear relational structure fixes reversal curse and enables consistent model editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21993)
*Dong-Kyum Kim,Minsung Kim,Jea Kwon,Nakyeong Yang,Meeyoung Cha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文发现反转诅咒不是语言模型的固有局限，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图谱上训练，模型会自然形成双线性关系结构，这能显著缓解反转诅咒并支持一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型中的反转诅咒问题，即模型无法从已学习的"A是B"推断出"B是A"，并探索模型编辑的一致性问题。

Method: 从零开始在合成的关系知识图谱数据集上训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 训练出的模型在隐藏表示中自然形成了双线性关系结构，这显著缓解了反转诅咒，并使模型编辑能够正确传播到反向事实和其他逻辑相关事实。

Conclusion: 模型编辑的成功不仅取决于编辑算法，更关键的是被修改知识的基础表示几何结构。在关系知识上训练能诱导双线性内部表示的出现，使语言模型在编辑后保持逻辑一致性。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

*Hanlin Zhu,Tianyu Guo,Song Mei,Stuart Russell,Nikhil Ghosh,Alberto Bietti,Jiantao Jiao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了GSM-Agent基准测试，用于评估LLM在需要主动收集信息解决小学数学问题时的代理推理能力，并发现即使是前沿模型准确率也仅67%。提出了代理推理图概念和工具增强的测试时扩展方法来改进代理推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试往往将代理推理与复杂的数学推理、专家级知识等能力混在一起，难以分离评估纯粹的代理推理能力。需要专门评估LLM结合工具使用和推理的能力。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准测试，要求LLM代理解决小学数学问题但只提供问题而不提供前提信息，需要主动使用工具收集信息。提出代理推理图概念来分析和可视化推理模式，并开发工具增强的测试时扩展方法鼓励模型重新访问节点。

Result: 即使是GPT-5等前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准上仅达到67%准确率。分析发现许多模型缺乏重新访问已访问节点的能力，这是静态推理中的关键模式。提出的工具增强方法能有效改进代理推理性能。

Conclusion: GSM-Agent基准和代理推理框架有助于未来理解和推进代理推理边界的研究，强调了在动态环境中重新访问信息的重要性。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证研究评估了模型融合技术在推理任务上的表现，发现模型融合可以有效平衡推理准确性和计算成本，甚至在某些情况下实现帕累托改进。

Motivation: 现实应用中对可调节推理能力的大型语言模型需求日益增长，需要能够高效生成平衡推理深度和计算成本的模型谱系的方法。

Method: 采用大规模实证研究方法，系统评估多种模型融合技术，通过调节融合强度构建准确率-效率曲线，分析不同推理基准上的表现。

Result: 研究发现模型融合提供了有效且可控的方法来校准推理准确性和标记效率之间的权衡，即使父模型权重空间高度发散时也能发挥作用，并识别出帕累托改进的实例。

Conclusion: 模型融合为创建具有特定推理配置的LLM提供了实用指南，能够满足多样化的应用需求，是平衡推理能力和计算成本的有效途径。

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A2R是一个非对称两阶段推理框架，通过并行探索和综合推理来弥合模型潜在能力与实际性能之间的差距，显著提升复杂任务解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在单次尝试中的性能与其在多条解决路径中展现的潜在能力之间存在显著差距，需要一种方法来显式地弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出A2R框架：第一阶段由"探索者"模型并行生成多个潜在解决方案，第二阶段由"综合者"模型整合这些参考进行更精细的推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型使用A2R框架相比自一致性基线性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（Qwen3-4B探索者+Qwen3-8B综合者）超越Qwen3-32B单模型性能，成本降低近30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，也是现实应用中高效实用的解决方案，展示了非对称扩展范式的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界机器人系统需要同时平衡多个冲突目标，但现有复杂目标交互的问题公式无法直接使用最先进的MOS算法。

Method: 提出广义问题公式，通过隐藏目标的聚合函数优化解决方案目标，仅需适当扩展核心操作以反映特定聚合函数。

Result: 在多个机器人规划问题中应用该方法，经验证据表明比未使用目标聚合的算法版本性能提升数个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的广义公式支持标准MOS算法的应用，通过适当扩展核心操作，在多样化机器人规划问题中实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

Motivation: 随着AI领域的资源意识增强，ML Emissions Calculator和CodeCarbon等能耗估计工具被广泛使用，但这些工具基于实用假设并忽略重要因素，其估计准确性存在疑问。

Method: 通过提出的验证框架，在数百个AI实验中比较静态和动态能耗估计方法与真实测量数据，系统评估估计可靠性。

Conclusion: 本研究为资源感知的机器学习和AI可持续性研究建立了透明度，验证了广泛使用的工具，并制定了改进现有技术的指南，提供了扩展验证到其他领域和工具的代码。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan是一个用于GUI任务自动化的两层级规划框架，通过结合结构化任务字典和用户行为日志挖掘，解决了现有LLM/VLM代理在泛化性、延迟和长序列任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM或VLM的规划-执行代理存在脆弱的泛化能力、高延迟和有限的长序列一致性，对UI变化或复杂任务缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两层级规划框架：高层规划将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典，低层规划通过实时GUI上下文解释将高层计划转化为具体动作序列，并结合用户行为日志挖掘实现个性化模式识别。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，Log2Plan显著提高了任务成功率和执行时间，在长序列任务中保持超过60.0%的成功率。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结构化规划和任务挖掘方法，实现了鲁棒且可适应的GUI自动化，特别在复杂多步骤工作流中表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中应考虑标注不确定性，使用概率度量来直接处理分布，而非传统的多数投票等聚合方法。这些度量适用于各种标注生成过程，计算轻量，呼吁社区发布原始标注并采用不确定性感知评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集的标注很少是确定的，因为标注者之间存在分歧且置信度在不同案例中不均匀。传统的聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，在医学影像基准测试中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名。

Method: 提出使用概率度量来明确考虑标注不确定性，这些度量直接操作于分布，可应用于各种标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评级或概率响应模型）。计算轻量，一旦按模型得分排序，具有线性时间实现的闭式表达式。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响模型排名，表明传统评估方法可能无法准确反映模型性能。

Conclusion: 呼吁机器学习社区发布数据集的原始标注，并采用不确定性感知评估方法，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据的特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language

LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有状态空间模型使用对角化转移矩阵虽然计算高效但表达能力受限，而无结构转移矩阵虽然表达能力强但计算成本过高，需要一种平衡计算效率和表达能力的方法。

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使并行扫描的计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系。

Result: 理论上模型BIBO稳定，能够用一层维度N和线性读出层模拟任何N状态FSA；实验上在FSA状态跟踪任务中显著优于现有SSM变体，在时间序列分类中性能与神经控制微分方程相当。

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了状态空间模型的表达能力，能够有效跟踪复杂FSA状态，为SSM-Transformer混合架构提供了有效组件。

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法对LLM的解释存在歧义：既没有字面解释LLM，也没有按预期解释LLM。需要一种更简单、直接的方法来生成LLM的反事实。

Method: 将LLM表示为非确定性因果模型，基于LLM的预期语义来生成反事实，该方法对任何黑盒LLM都直接适用且无需修改。

Result: 新方法比现有方法更简单，且不依赖LLM的实现细节，可直接应用于任何黑盒LLM。

Conclusion: 为LLM中的反事实推理提供了理论基础，为特定应用的反事实生成方法奠定了基础，澄清了两种方法之间的关系。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

TL;DR: SeekBench是首个通过逐步分析评估LLM搜索代理认知能力的基准，包含190个专家标注的轨迹和1800多个响应步骤，用于评估代理是否基于观察证据生成推理步骤、自适应重新制定搜索以及正确评估证据充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注最终答案准确性，忽视了LLM搜索代理如何利用外部证据进行推理和行动，需要更细粒度的评估方法来衡量其认知能力。

Method: 开发了SeekBench基准，包含专家标注的190个轨迹和1800多个响应步骤，每个步骤都带有证据标注，用于分析代理的推理基础、搜索适应性和证据充分性评估能力。

Result: 创建了一个包含详细证据标注的基准数据集，能够对LLM搜索代理的认知能力进行细粒度评估。

Conclusion: SeekBench为评估LLM搜索代理的认知能力提供了首个系统化的基准，填补了现有评估方法在推理过程分析方面的空白。

Abstract: Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents
with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA).
However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking
how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce
SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence}
of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces.
SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps
generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for
granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in
observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from
low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess
whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.

TL;DR: 提出EMMA框架，通过DreamTransfer生成多视角一致的机器人操作视频和AdaMix训练策略，显著提升视觉语言动作模型在未见物体类别和新视觉领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集大规模真实机器人操作数据成本高昂且耗时，限制了VLA模型的泛化能力。

Method: 使用DreamTransfer进行文本控制的视觉编辑生成多视角一致视频，结合AdaMix动态调整训练权重关注困难样本。

Result: 生成视频在多视角一致性、几何保真度和文本条件准确性上显著优于现有方法，在零样本视觉领域任务中相对性能提升超过200%。

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和有效训练策略，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化能力，为机器人操作提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Motivation: 利用基础模型自动化搜索人工生命模拟，探索开放式进化搜索的新方法。

Method: 使用Gemma-3在Lenia基质中提出进化目标，比较两种策略：EST（单目标进化）和ETT（序列目标进化）。

Result: EST促进更大的视觉新颖性，ETT培养更连贯和可解释的进化序列。

Conclusion: ASAL++为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指明了具有开放式特征的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

TL;DR: GeoSketch是一个神经符号框架，将几何推理转化为交互式感知-推理-行动循环，通过结构化逻辑表示、符号推理和可执行草图操作来动态解决几何问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型将图表视为静态图像，缺乏动态操作能力，而人类几何推理需要辅助线构造和仿射变换等动态操作。

Method: 集成三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一步推理步骤，草图操作模块执行辅助线绘制或变换操作。采用两阶段训练：2000条符号化轨迹的监督微调，然后使用密集符号奖励进行强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试上，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率，优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: GeoSketch通过统一层次决策、可执行视觉动作和符号验证，将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

Motivation: 传统LLM智能体开发需要精心设计工作流、提示词和迭代调优，需要LLM技术和领域专业知识，这些手工制作的限制阻碍了LLM智能体在各行业的可扩展性和成本效益。

Method: 提出金字塔DAG多智能体框架，包含：智能体即工具机制自动分解复杂任务；双重审核确保任务质量；智能体路由实现高效任务匹配；自进化机制根据新任务或性能问题自主重构智能体DAG；原子任务设计支持并行执行。

Conclusion: InfiAgent框架演化成一个通用的金字塔多智能体系统，能够解决广泛的问题，显著提高了LLM智能体的开发效率和执行性能。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型代理能力增强且获得更多现实工具访问，需要可扩展的评估框架，而传统基准测试设计成本高且需要人工设计有效任务。

Method: 提出EELMA算法，通过多轮文本交互近似估计有效赋权，在语言游戏和现实网页浏览场景中进行验证。

Result: 赋权与平均任务性能强相关，能表征环境复杂性和代理因素（如思维链、模型规模、记忆长度）的影响，高赋权状态和行动通常是通用能力的关键时刻。

Conclusion: 赋权是评估复杂开放环境中语言模型代理的有吸引力的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

Motivation: 理解LLM如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要提供可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确推理流形的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并跟踪各层的偏差变化来定位推理链偏离点。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM在社会模拟中存在两种不同的社会倾向："适应性利己主义者"默认优先考虑自身利益但在社会规范影响下会增加利他行为；"利他优化者"则表现出固有的利他逻辑，始终优先集体利益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作，忽略了大规模智能体社会中利他主义的涌现。需要理解LLM代理所体现的社会逻辑。

Method: 引入Schelling变体城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM代理在利己（个人效用）和利他（系统效用）目标之间导航。采用扎根理论启发的方法系统编码代理推理。

Result: 发现LLM在社会倾向上存在根本差异，识别出两种不同的原型。适应性利己主义者在社会规范信息板影响下利他行为显著增加。

Conclusion: 模型选择不仅是选择推理能力，更是选择内在的社会行动逻辑。适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，利他优化者更适合模拟理想化的亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键局限：结果奖励存在信用分配问题（正确最终答案可能强化错误推理），传统判别式过程监督缺乏对OR建模步骤间相互依赖关系的整体评估。

Method: 提出StepORLM框架，包含策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型(GenPRM)的协同进化循环，采用双重反馈机制（外部求解器的结果验证和GenPRM的整体过程评估），通过加权直接偏好优化(W-DPO)进行对齐。

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在六个基准测试中达到新的SOTA，显著优于更大规模的通用模型、代理方法和专业基线。协同进化的GenPRM可作为强大的通用过程验证器，大幅提升推理扩展性能。

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化机制，有效解决了OR问题中的信用分配和过程评估问题，为LLM在运筹学领域的应用提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统的压缩-传输-重建流水线中会导致重复退化，无法满足多模态双向交互的需求。

Method: 采用紧凑的token化表示作为通信媒介，使用轻量级基于Transformer的熵模型（通用、掩码和文本条件化）来最小化token间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、扩展和视觉问答等任务中，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信提供了一个实用且前瞻性的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Experts Search (DES)方法，通过动态控制MoE模型中激活的专家数量来增强推理能力，无需额外成本即可生成多样化的推理轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现改变激活专家数量可以产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了一个未被充分探索的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：1) Dynamic MoE - 在推理时直接控制专家数量以生成多样化推理轨迹；2) Expert Configuration Inheritance - 在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在不同运行间变化专家数量，平衡稳定性和多样性。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线方法，提高了准确性和稳定性，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: DES是一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLMs中结构灵活性如何推进推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确，需要系统分析RL在规划任务中的优势和局限性。

Method: 采用可处理的基于图的抽象模型，重点分析策略梯度(PG)和Q-learning方法，并在Blocksworld基准上进行实证验证。

Result: 理论分析表明：SFT会产生基于共现的伪相关解；RL通过探索实现更好的泛化；PG存在多样性崩溃问题；Q-learning具有离策略学习和多样性保持优势；需要精心设计奖励函数防止奖励黑客。

Conclusion: RL在LLM规划中通过探索机制发挥关键作用，但不同RL方法各有优劣，Q-learning在多样性和稳定性方面优于PG，合理的奖励设计对防止奖励黑客至关重要。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on
our website.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PowerGS是一个针对3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)的功耗优化框架，在保持质量约束下联合最小化渲染和显示功耗，在XR设备上实现高达86%的总功耗降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS系列模型在功耗受限的XR设备上效率低下，这些设备需要在瓦特级别运行，因此需要优化其功耗表现。

Method: 提出了一个通用问题公式，通过识别显示和渲染功耗景观中的等质量曲线，并在给定曲线上找到功耗最小点（具有闭式解），同时支持注视点渲染以进一步节省功耗。

Result: 广泛的实验和用户研究表明，与最先进的3DGS模型相比，PowerGS实现了高达86%的总功耗降低，在主观和客观质量方面损失最小。

Conclusion: PowerGS是第一个在质量约束下联合最小化3DGS渲染和显示功耗的框架，为XR设备提供了高效的3DGS解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering,
pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an
interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family
models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR)
devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS,
the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS
under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show
that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in
the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying
the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution
given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports
foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user
studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to
state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and
objective quality. Code is available at

Conclusion: DeformSplat能够仅从单张图像重建一致的变形，为受限场景下的3D变形恢复提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.
