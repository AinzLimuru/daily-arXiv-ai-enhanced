### [1] [SoC-DT: Standard-of-Care Aligned Digital Twins for Patient-Specific Tumor Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03287)
*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoC-DT是一个可微分框架，结合反应扩散肿瘤生长模型和标准治疗干预，通过基因组和人口统计学个性化来预测治疗后肿瘤结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测标准治疗下的肿瘤轨迹是肿瘤学的重大未满足需求，传统反应扩散模型无法捕捉异质性治疗范式下的肿瘤动态。

Method: 提出SoC-DT框架，统一反应扩散肿瘤生长模型、离散标准治疗干预（手术、化疗、放疗）以及基因组和人口统计学个性化；开发IMEX-SoC隐式-显式指数时间差分求解器确保稳定性、正性和可扩展性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界胶质瘤数据上评估，SoC-DT在预测肿瘤动态方面持续优于经典PDE基线和纯数据驱动的神经模型。

Conclusion: SoC-DT通过将机械可解释性与现代可微分求解器相结合，为肿瘤学中患者特异性数字孪生建立了原则性基础，实现生物学一致的肿瘤动态估计。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

### [2] [Visualizing Celebrity Dynamics in Video Content: A Proposed Approach Using Face Recognition Timestamp Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03292)
*Doğanay Demir,İlknur Durgar Elkahlout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个结合分布式多GPU推理系统和交互式可视化平台的混合框架，用于分析视频剧集中的名人动态，通过高效处理视频数据生成时间戳记录，并提供多种可视化图表来揭示名人出现模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频内容主导的时代，理解视频结构和动态变得越来越重要，需要开发能够高效处理大量视频数据并提供深入分析的系统。

Method: 使用优化的ONNX模型、异构批量推理和高吞吐量并行处理的分布式多GPU推理系统，结合交互式可视化平台，生成时间戳出现记录并提供多种可视化图表。

Result: 系统能够高效处理大量视频数据，生成全面的可视化分析，包括出现频率、时长分析、共同出现矩阵等，揭示名人突出程度、屏幕时间分布、时间动态等模式。

Conclusion: 通过将分布式识别与结构化、可视化驱动的分析相结合，这项工作为娱乐分析、内容创作策略和观众参与研究开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

### [3] [Domain-Robust Marine Plastic Detection Using Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03294)
*Saanvi Kataria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种深度学习模型在水下塑料垃圾跨域检测中的性能，发现轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2表现最佳，而零样本模型CLIP和Gemini在精度和召回率上呈现互补特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋塑料污染是紧迫的环境威胁，需要可靠的水下垃圾自动检测系统。然而，在一个数据集上训练的视觉系统往往因域偏移而在新图像上性能下降。

Method: 在标记的水下数据集上训练CNN（MobileNetV2、ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉变换器（DeiT-Tiny、ViT-B16），然后在来自不同来源的跨域测试集上评估。同时评估了两个零样本模型CLIP ViT-L14和Google Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Result: 轻量级MobileNetV2提供最强的跨域性能（F1 0.97），超越更大模型。所有微调模型都实现了高精度（约99%），但在召回率上存在差异。零样本CLIP相对敏感但易产生假阳性，而Gemini则呈现相反特征。

Conclusion: 具有监督训练的紧凑CNN可以有效地泛化用于跨域水下检测，而大型预训练视觉语言模型提供了互补优势。

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

### [4] [Multimodal Arabic Captioning with Interpretable Visual Concept Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03295)
*Passant Elchafei,Amany Fashwan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCAP是一个阿拉伯语图像描述框架，结合CLIP视觉标签检索与多模态文本生成，通过提取可解释的阿拉伯视觉概念来生成文化一致且上下文准确的阿拉伯语描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的端到端图像描述方法缺乏可解释性，VLCAP旨在通过基于视觉概念的基础生成方法，为阿拉伯语图像描述提供更可解释且文化一致的解决方案。

Method: 使用三种多语言编码器(mCLIP、AraCLIP、Jina V4)进行视觉标签检索，构建包含训练描述和约21K通用领域标签的混合词汇表，将检索到的标签转换为阿拉伯语提示，结合原始图像输入视觉语言模型(Qwen-VL和Gemini Pro Vision)生成描述。

Result: mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision组合在BLEU-1(5.34%)和余弦相似度(60.01%)上表现最佳，而AraCLIP + Qwen-VL在LLM-judge评分(36.33%)上最高。

Conclusion: VLCAP的可解释管道能够生成文化一致且上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述，为阿拉伯语多模态理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

### [5] [Convolutional Neural Nets vs Vision Transformers: A SpaceNet Case Study with Balanced vs Imbalanced Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03297)
*Akshar Gothi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比EfficientNet-B0和ViT-Base在SpaceNet数据集上的性能，分别在标签不平衡和平衡两种分布下评估准确率、F1分数、模型大小和延迟等指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较卷积神经网络和Vision Transformer在不同标签分布下的表现差异，特别是在资源受限环境中的实用性。

Method: 在SpaceNet数据集上进行控制实验，使用不平衡五类分割和平衡重采样分割（每类700张图像），采用相同预处理、轻量数据增强和40轮训练预算。

Result: 在不平衡分割中，EfficientNet-B0达到93%测试准确率且延迟更低；在平衡分割中，两者表现都很好，EfficientNet-B0达到99%，ViT-Base保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 平衡标签分布可以缩小架构差距，但CNN在效率方面仍保持优势。

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

Conclusion: 通过将视觉AI进展与现实部署考虑相结合，本综述为开发下一代感知系统以增强VRU安全提供了基础参考，并指出了未来研究面临的四个主要挑战。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

### [7] [The View From Space: Navigating Instrumentation Differences with EOFMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03316)
*Ryan P. Demilt,Nicholas LaHaye,Karis Tenneson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 地球观测基础模型(EOFMs)的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感，理解这种差异对于当前EOFMs设计的陷阱和未来发展至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EOFMs大多在单一模态数据上训练，然后通过跨模态匹配波段来应用或基准测试，但不同传感器架构对EOFMs内部表示的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 分析EOFMs表示空间对传感器架构的敏感性，研究不同传感器设计对模型内部表示的影响。

Result: EOFMs的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感，这种敏感性揭示了当前EOFMs设计的潜在问题。

Conclusion: 理解传感器架构对EOFMs表示空间的影响为模型开发者、用户和遥感科学社区提供了重要视角，指明了稳健发展的方向。

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

### [8] [Photorealistic Inpainting for Perturbation-based Explanations in Ecological Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03317)
*Günel Aghakishiyeva,Jiayi Zhou,Saagar Arya,James David Poling,Holly R. Houliston,Jamie N. Womble,David W. Johnston,Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于修复引导的扰动解释技术，通过生成逼真的局部编辑来揭示生态监测视觉模型中影响预测的关键形态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态监测中自动化视觉模型的不透明预测限制了信任和现场应用，需要可解释的方法来揭示模型决策依据。

Method: 使用修复引导的扰动技术，结合Segment-Anything-Model精炼的掩码，进行对象移除/替换和背景替换等干预，生成保持场景上下文的光逼真编辑。

Result: 该方法能够定位诊断结构，避免传统扰动的删除伪影，在港口海豹检测任务中通过翻转率和置信度下降等指标验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生态学中AI部署提供了领域相关的见解，支持专家验证并增强AI在生态学中的可信度。

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely
adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms,
semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical
region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist,
including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

### [10] [DECOR: Deep Embedding Clustering with Orientation Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03328)
*Fiona Victoria Stanley Jothiraj,Arunaggiri Pandian Karunanidhi,Seth A. Eichmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECOR是一个面向晶圆缺陷检测的深度聚类框架，通过考虑晶圆图的方向变化，能够在复杂、不平衡、未标记的数据条件下可靠地对缺陷模式进行聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中，晶圆缺陷的早期检测对产品良率优化至关重要。但原始晶圆数据通常复杂、未标记、不平衡，且单个晶圆可能包含多种缺陷，需要设计能在这种不完美数据条件下保持可靠的聚类方法。

Method: 提出DECOR框架，这是一种具有方向鲁棒性的深度聚类方法，能够将晶圆图中的复杂缺陷模式分组到一致的簇中。该方法明确考虑了晶圆图的方向变化，确保空间相似的缺陷无论其旋转或对齐方式如何都能被一致地聚类。

Result: 在开源MixedWM38数据集上的实验表明，DECOR能够无需手动调参即可发现簇，并且在性能上优于现有的聚类基线方法。

Conclusion: DECOR为自动化视觉检测系统提供了一个可靠且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理晶圆缺陷检测中的复杂数据条件。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

### [11] [Error correction in multiclass image classification of facial emotion on unbalanced samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03337)
*Andrey A. Lebedev,Victor B. Kazantsev,Sergey V. Stasenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LSTM和注意力机制的面部表情分类方法，专门针对类别不平衡问题，通过错误校正技术提高对小类别的识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情识别中类别不平衡的问题，特别是在某些情绪类别样本远少于其他类别的情况下，提高对小类别（如罕见情绪）的识别准确率。

Method: 使用基于LSTM的神经网络模型，结合注意力机制聚焦于面部关键区域。通过在六个类别子集上训练模型，然后对第七个被排除的类别进行错误校正。

Result: 实验表明所有类别都可以进行校正，但成功率不同。在测试集上，校正某些类别时小类别的关键质量指标有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效应用于面部表情分析系统，特别适合类别分布不平衡的分类任务，如反欺诈系统中罕见事件的检测。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

TL;DR: 提出了DCG-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型在动态图表生成任务上的能力，并开发了Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B模型，在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在静态图表生成和理解方面取得了显著进展，但其在动态图表生成和理解方面的潜力尚未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建了DCG-8K高质量数据集，包含指令-代码-视频三元组和QA对；提出了两阶段训练方法，使用联合代码-视觉奖励进行组相对策略优化。

Result: 基准测试揭示了现有MLLM在视觉到图表任务中的不足；开发的模型在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%，仅用3B参数就能与专有模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方法有效，开发的模型在动态图表生成任务上表现出色，证明了方法的有效性，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

*Vlardimir Yugay,Duy-Kien Nguyen,Theo Gevers,Cees G. M. Snoek,Martin R. Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VoT（视觉里程计Transformer），一种端到端的单目视觉里程计方法，无需传统手工组件如捆绑调整、特征匹配、相机标定或密集3D重建，直接预测相机运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目视觉里程计方法依赖预训练深度学习组件和优化模块，形成复杂流水线，严重依赖相机标定和超参数调优，在未见过的真实场景中表现不佳。现有大规模3D模型虽能提供泛化性重建和相机位姿估计，但处理长视频和提供准确逐帧估计的能力有限。

Method: VoT通过时空注意力处理单目帧序列，提取特征并建模全局关系。该方法直接预测相机运动，无需估计密集几何结构，仅依赖相机位姿进行监督。框架模块化灵活，可无缝集成各种预训练编码器作为特征提取器。

Result: 实验表明VoT能有效扩展到更大数据集，从更强的预训练骨干网络中显著受益，在不同相机运动和标定设置下具有良好泛化性，性能超越传统方法且运行速度快3倍以上。

Conclusion: 单目视觉里程计可通过端到端方式有效解决，无需传统手工组件，VoT框架展示了优越的性能、泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

Abstract: Sonar images are relevant for advancing underwater exploration, autonomous
navigation, and ecosystem monitoring. However, the progress depends on data
availability. The scarcity of publicly available, well-annotated sonar image
datasets creates a significant bottleneck for the development of robust machine
learning models. This paper presents a comprehensive and concise review of the
current landscape of sonar image datasets, seeking not only to catalog existing
resources but also to contextualize them, identify gaps, and provide a clear
roadmap, serving as a base guide for researchers of any kind who wish to start
or advance in the field of underwater acoustic data analysis. We mapped
publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side
Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS),
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar
(DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification,
detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on
state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The
findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline,
offering a clear and accessible comparison of characteristics, sizes, and
annotation details datasets.

TL;DR: 提出溯源网络，一种新型神经网络模型，通过将预测直接关联到支持性训练样本来实现端到端的可解释性，在模型架构中嵌入解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习的模型不透明、幻觉问题以及数据贡献者信用分配等关键挑战，提高神经模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Method: 模型类似于学习的KNN，每个输出都由特征空间中加权的具体样本支持，通过联合优化主任务和可解释性目标来训练。

Conclusion: 溯源网络为现有可解释性技术提供了补充方法，虽然引入额外计算成本且目前适用于中等规模数据集，但能提供传统深度网络无法提供的模型行为洞察。

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的3D高斯溅射方法，通过为每个高斯添加alpha、RGB或RGBA纹理映射来增强其表达能力，解决了传统3DGS中每个高斯只能表示单一颜色和简单椭球体的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然重建和渲染质量高、速度快，但每个高斯只能表示单一颜色和简单椭球体，表达能力有限。本文旨在通过引入纹理映射来增强高斯的表达能力。

Method: 从传统图形学中的纹理和alpha映射获得灵感，为每个高斯添加alpha、RGB或RGBA纹理映射，使每个高斯能够表示更丰富的纹理模式和几何结构。

Result: 在多种标准基准数据集和自定义捕获上进行验证，结果表明使用仅alpha纹理映射就能显著提高高斯表达能力，而使用RGB纹理映射则达到最高表达能力。在保持或减少高斯数量的同时，图像质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将纹理映射集成到3D高斯溅射中，可以显著提高每个高斯原语的表达能力，在保持高效性的同时获得更好的重建和渲染质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast
training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are
always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor.
Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent
is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity
of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration
from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with
3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance
representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture
maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each
Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns
and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in
naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of
Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further
augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity.
We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our
own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image
quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower
number of Gaussians.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的无监督异常检测框架UCF，通过匹配视角处理单模态和多模态场景，使用可学习的过滤模块优化异常成本体积，在22个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法存在匹配噪声问题，且单模态和多模态方法相互隔离，缺乏统一框架。本文旨在解决匹配噪声并统一处理不同模态的异常检测任务。

Method: 提出统一成本过滤（UCF）框架，通过构建测试样本与正常样本的匹配成本体积，然后使用多层注意力引导的可学习过滤模块来减少匹配噪声并突出细微异常。

Result: 在22个多样化基准测试中，UCF显著提升了多种无监督异常检测方法的性能，在单模态（RGB）和多模态（RGB-3D、RGB-Text）场景中均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: UCF提供了一个通用的后处理框架，能够有效处理匹配噪声，统一支持单模态和多模态无监督异常检测，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at

Method: 利用视觉语言模型(VLMs)的多模态能力来识别缺失或不一致的检测结果，指导检测结果的优化。

Result: 该框架能够实现自动化质量评估，并在复杂的工业图纸上提高整体检测性能。

Conclusion: 提出的VLM框架填补了工业图纸数字化过程中自动评估物体检测质量的空白，为构建更可靠的数字孪生系统提供了支持。

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still
face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object
configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that
integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps
through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal
embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and
MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively.
Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories
such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on
the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a
significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial
for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两相光学切片结构照明显微镜中，减少采集时间会引入传统去噪方法难以抑制的残留伪影，而监督训练又受限于缺乏干净的光学切片地面真实数据

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络（包括非对称去噪自编码器和U-Net），通过在合成图像上应用真实伪影场来创建合成训练对，然后评估真实OS-SI图像

Result: 两种网络都提高了图像清晰度，每种网络在不同类型的伪影上都表现出色

Conclusion: 合成训练使得OS-SI图像的监督去噪成为可能，编码器-解码器网络有潜力简化重建工作流程

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on
the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve
image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These
results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of
OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to
streamline reconstruction workflows.

Motivation: 现有多模态方法主要依赖少量高变基因，限制了预测范围并忽略了协调的生物学程序，需要更全面的生物信息表示方法。

Method: 使用ssGSEA计算通路激活分数，通过transformer编码通路信号，利用对比学习将通路特征与组织学特征对齐。

Result: 在三个癌症ST数据集中，PEaRL在基因和通路水平表达预测方面均优于现有方法，Pearson相关系数分别提高了58.9%和20.4%。

Conclusion: 基于通路的转录组表示能产生更生物可信和可解释的多模态模型，推动计算病理学超越基因水平嵌入。

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that
lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal'
approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic
understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep
learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS
introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical
semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a

Motivation: 现有的Transformer缺乏对科学和计算机视觉中常见几何对称性的归纳偏置，而现有的等变方法往往通过复杂、计算密集的设计牺牲了Transformer的效率和灵活性。

Method: 通过定义相对于柏拉图立体对称群参考框架的注意力机制，引入原则性的权重共享方案，使模型能够同时保持对连续平移和柏拉图对称性的等变性。

Result: 在计算机视觉（CIFAR-10）、3D点云（ScanObjectNN）和分子属性预测（QM9、OMol25）等多个基准测试中，Platonic Transformer通过利用几何约束实现了有竞争力的性能，且无需额外计算成本。

Conclusion: Platonic Transformer成功解决了Transformer缺乏几何对称性归纳偏置的问题，在保持标准Transformer效率和灵活性的同时，实现了对几何对称性的等变性。

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to

Motivation: 内窥镜检查的文档记录负担给胃肠病学家带来巨大压力，导致临床工作流程效率低下和医生倦怠

Method: 使用基于transformer的视觉编码器和文本解码器，采用两阶段训练：先在图像/文本描述对上预训练，然后在图像/报告对上微调

Result: 模型能够生成具有临床意义的发现，简化文档记录过程

Conclusion: 该方法有望减轻医生工作量并改善患者护理

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

### [29] [SketchPlan: Diffusion Based Drone Planning From Human Sketches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03545)
*Sixten Norelius,Aaron O. Feldman,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchPlan是一个基于扩散模型的规划器，通过2D手绘草图在深度图像上生成无人机3D飞行路径，实现了零样本的仿真到真实环境迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何让无人机通过人类直观的2D手绘草图来理解导航意图，并生成安全可靠的3D飞行路径的问题。

Method: 系统包含SketchAdapter（将手绘草图映射到2D投影路径）和DiffPath（从2D投影和第一人称深度图像推断3D轨迹的扩散模型），使用混合标注数据训练。

Result: 在真实世界无人机测试中，低/中等障碍物环境下达到100%成功率，高障碍物环境下达到40%成功率，比关键消融实验高出20-60%的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 混合人工标注和自动标注数据的训练方法，结合模块化设计，显著提升了系统理解人类意图和推断3D路径的能力。

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对AI视频会议中身份劫持攻击的防御方法，通过从姿态-表情潜在空间中提取生物特征信息来检测非法身份替换，无需查看重建的RGB视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI视频会议系统通过传输紧凑的姿态-表情潜在空间来节省带宽，但该潜在空间可能被劫持用于实时冒充受害者。由于每帧都是合成的，传统的深度伪造检测器无法工作。

Method: 使用姿态条件化的大间隔对比编码器，从传输的潜在空间中分离出持久的身份线索，同时消除瞬时的姿态和表情信息。通过余弦测试检测身份替换。

Result: 在多个说话头生成模型上的实验表明，该方法始终优于现有防御方法，可实时运行，并对分布外场景具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用姿态-表情潜在空间中的生物特征信息，有效解决了AI视频会议中的身份劫持安全问题，提供了一种无需查看RGB视频的实时防御方案。

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了REVEL任务和DragStream方法，实现自回归视频扩散模型的流式细粒度拖拽控制，解决潜在空间分布漂移和上下文帧干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型难以实现流式细粒度输出控制，无法保证与用户期望的一致性，需要解决拖拽操作中的潜在分布漂移和上下文干扰问题。

Method: 提出训练无关的DragStream方法，包含自适应分布自校正策略（利用相邻帧统计约束潜在嵌入漂移）和空间频率选择性优化机制（选择性传播视觉线索以减少上下文干扰）。

Result: 方法可无缝集成到现有自回归视频扩散模型中，大量实验验证了DragStream的有效性。

Conclusion: REVEL任务和DragStream方法成功解决了视频拖拽操作中的关键挑战，实现了流式细粒度视频操控。

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在计算病理学中提供了强大的通用特征提取器，但针对特定诊断任务进行适配和基准测试通常耗时且资源密集，特别是考虑到其规模和多样性。

Method: 提出Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL)框架，通过灵活集成多个基础模型的特征，保留它们的互补优势。

Result: 在前列腺癌(PANDA)、卵巢癌(UBC-OCEAN)和乳腺癌(TCGA-BrCa)三个数据集上的分类任务中，GAS-MIL始终优于或与单个基础模型和现有MIL方法表现相当。

Conclusion: GAS-MIL通过有效整合异构基础模型，简化了病理学中的模型部署，并为未来多模态和精准肿瘤学应用提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing
powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and
benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and
diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection
Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer
datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL
consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机递送纳洛酮系统中旁观者情境感知实时评估的研究空白，提高急救响应效率。

Method: 创建Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation Dataset (DANDSD)数据集，提出基于图嵌入和transformer模型的视频实时SA评估框架。

Result: 实现了高性能的SA预测，在时间分割准确率上比FINCH基线方法提高了9%的MoF和5%的IoU。

Conclusion: 该工作支持开发能够有效指导旁观者的自适应无人机系统，改善急救响应结果并拯救生命。

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

*Mayimunah Nagayi,Alice Khan,Tamryn Frank,Rina Swart,Clement Nyirenda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估四种开源OCR系统（Tesseract、EasyOCR、PaddleOCR、TrOCR）在食品包装图像上的性能，重点关注成分表和营养信息提取的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品包装上的OCR对于合规性和营养监测很重要，但由于多语言文本、密集布局、字体变化、反光和曲面等挑战而困难。

Method: 使用231种产品（1,628张图像）的数据集，评估四种模型的执行速度和覆盖率，并对113张图像（60种产品）的基准子集进行准确性评估。

Result: 在基准子集上，Tesseract获得最低字符错误率（0.912）和最高BLEU分数（0.245）；EasyOCR在准确性和多语言支持间取得良好平衡；PaddleOCR覆盖率接近完全但速度较慢；TrOCR表现最差。

Conclusion: 研究提供了包装特定基准，建立了基线，并指出了布局感知方法和文本定位的改进方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food
packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

TL;DR: FrameOracle是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过预测最相关帧和所需帧数来优化视频理解，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输入帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧采样策略无法适应信息密度和任务复杂度的变化，导致效率低下和信息损失，需要更智能的帧选择方法。

Method: 使用四阶段课程学习训练，前三阶段依赖跨模态相似度等弱代理信号，最后阶段利用新数据集FrameOracle-41K的关键帧标注进行强监督。

Result: 在5个VLMs和6个基准测试中，FrameOracle将16帧输入平均减少到10.4帧而不损失准确性；从64帧候选开始，平均减少到13.9帧同时提高准确性1.4%。

Conclusion: FrameOracle实现了可扩展视频理解的最优效率-准确性权衡，显著提升了视频语言模型的帧采样效率。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合协同微调(CFT)方法，用于游戏视觉bug检测，有效结合标记和未标记数据，减少对目标游戏标记数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏视觉bug的人工识别成本高且需要专业知识，而监督模型需要大量标记数据，但这类bug出现频率低，标记数据获取困难。

Method: 使用混合协同微调方法，整合目标游戏和同领域游戏的标记样本，并加入未标记数据来增强特征表示学习。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在多种游戏环境中优于传统基线方法，即使仅使用50%的目标游戏标记数据也能保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFT方法提高了游戏视觉bug检测的可扩展性和适应性，有效利用所有可用数据，显著减少了对特定目标游戏标记示例的依赖。

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive
and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While
supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

*Alexander V. Mantzaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRM模型在MNIST上表现良好（≈98%测试准确率），但在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100等小分辨率自然图像上过拟合严重，性能不如简单的卷积网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究HRM模型（包含两个Transformer模块、DEQ风格训练、深度监督等）是否可以作为实用的图像分类器。

Method: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上评估HRM，采用原始训练策略：无数据增强、相同优化器家族、一周期预热后余弦衰减、标签平滑。

Result: HRM在MNIST上达到98%测试准确率，但在CIFAR-10上仅65.0%（CNN为77.2%），CIFAR-100上仅29.7%（CNN为45.3%），且训练速度慢30倍。

Conclusion: 对于无增强的小分辨率图像分类，现有HRM不如简单卷积架构，但模型修改可能带来显著改进。

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

Motivation: 自监督学习(SSL)的最新进展使得学习通用视觉特征成为可能，DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了弱监督方法(WSL)，需要系统分析其核心思想和性能表现。

Method: 采用多裁剪视图增强和基于均值教师的自蒸馏方法，使用transformer骨干网络学习视觉特征。

Result: DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了OpenCLIP等弱监督方法，其学习的特征在各种下游任务中表现出色，并展现出一些显著的新兴特性。

Conclusion: DINOv2建立了新的技术标准，但其仍存在局限性，需要进一步研究来改进和发展自监督学习方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to
learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level
semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the
recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly
supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we
examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and
self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous
work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL
methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent
properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by
briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research
directions.

TL;DR: 提出DCS框架，通过扩散模型和分类器的协同进化解决小样本类增量学习问题，利用动态多层面奖励函数指导图像生成，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FSCIL方法因依赖有限数据集而泛化能力不足，直接使用扩散模型进行数据增强可能导致语义不对齐或引导无效。

Method: 采用扩散-分类器协同框架，基于分类器状态设计动态多层面奖励函数，在特征层面确保语义一致性和多样性，在logits层面促进探索性图像生成和类间区分度。

Result: 在FSCIL基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著增强了知识保留和新类学习能力。

Conclusion: DCS通过扩散模型和分类器的相互促进循环，有效解决了FSCIL中的数据稀缺和稳定性-可塑性权衡问题。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and
underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors.
Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and
beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a
novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion
techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input
for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our
conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an
accuracy of 97.32%.

*Zhengyi Liu,Xinrui Wang,Xianyong Fang,Zhengzheng Tu,Linbo Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAMSOD模型，通过单模态监督增强非主导模态学习，使用梯度解耦减少冲突梯度影响，并采用解耦适配器分别处理高低激活神经元，提升RGB-T显著目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在微调Segment Anything Model时忽略了两种模态的不平衡收敛问题以及高低激活之间的显著梯度差异，限制了性能提升空间。

Method: 使用单模态监督增强非主导模态学习，采用梯度解耦技术减少冲突梯度对模型收敛的影响，利用两个解耦适配器分别掩码高低激活神经元以增强背景学习并突出前景目标。

Result: 在RGB-T SOD基准数据集、涂鸦监督RGB-T SOD、全监督RGB-D SOD数据集以及全监督RGB-D轨道表面缺陷检测上的实验均证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SAMSOD模型通过解决模态不平衡和梯度冲突问题，在多个RGB-T和RGB-D任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-
and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance
enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing
foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on
RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble
supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised
RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Conclusion: 提出的SOREC数据集和PIZA方法有效解决了小目标指代表达理解的挑战，相关资源已公开

Abstract: Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to localize the target object
described by a natural language expression. Recent advances in vision-language
learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks.
However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge
despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving.
To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC
targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC)
dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and
corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we
propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available
on the project page.

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了LAION-400M数据集的全面人口统计标注，揭示了训练数据中的人口不平衡和有害关联，并证明CLIP和Stable Diffusion中60-70%的性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。

Motivation: 解决大规模多模态数据集缺乏人口统计标注的问题，以理解训练数据在产生模型偏见中的作用。

Method: 通过验证的自动标注流程，结合目标检测、多模态字幕生成和微调分类器，为整个数据集创建以人为中心的标注，包括边界框、感知性别和种族/民族标签以及自动生成的字幕。

Result: 发现人口统计不平衡和有害关联，如男性和被感知为黑人或中东裔的个体与犯罪相关和负面内容的不成比例关联。60-70%的CLIP和Stable Diffusion性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。

Conclusion: 这些资源首次建立了数据集组成与下游模型偏见之间的大规模实证联系。

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法尚未充分利用预训练神经网络的潜力，需要探索任务特异性与数据量在非正式住区检测中的相对重要性

Method: 使用两种预训练神经网络：1）在大型多样化数据集上预训练的通用网络；2）在卫星图像上预训练的专用网络，比较它们在里约热内卢贫民窟检测任务中的表现

Result: 论文未明确说明具体结果，但通过比较两种网络的性能来评估任务特异性和数据量的影响

Conclusion: 研究旨在确定在非正式住区检测中，任务特异性还是预训练数据量对性能提升更为关键

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already
been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by
recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度伪造防御措施缺乏鲁棒性和可靠性，需要开发能够绕过这些防御的新方法，并揭示当前防御范式的弱点。

Method: 使用低秩适配（LoRA）修补技术，在Deepfake生成器中注入可插拔的LoRA补丁；采用可学习门控机制自适应控制LoRA补丁效果；引入多模态特征对齐（MMFA）损失函数实现语义级特征对齐。

Result: 仅用1000个面部示例和单轮微调，LoRA修补成功击败多种主动防御措施，揭示了当前防御策略的关键弱点。

Conclusion: 当前深度伪造防御策略存在严重漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的防御方法，同时提出的防御性LoRA修补可作为补充解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有VPR方法在训练-测试领域差异较大的挑战性基准上表现不佳，而测试时的参考集包含目标领域信息，可作为补充信息源来弥合领域差距

Method: 提出参考集微调(RSF)，利用测试前可获得的参考集图像和位姿信息对VPR模型进行微调

Result: 在挑战性数据集上平均提升Recall@1约2.3%，微调后的模型保持泛化能力，且RSF方法在不同测试数据集上均有效

Conclusion: 参考集微调是一种简单有效的方法，能够利用测试时参考集信息显著提升VPR模型在领域差异较大场景下的性能

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

*Jiaxin Deng,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARSAM通过自适应采样、重用和混合分解梯度来加速SAM，在保持模型泛化能力的同时将计算速度提升约40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM虽然能提升模型泛化能力，但其计算成本是SGD的两倍，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 将SAM梯度分解为SGD梯度和二阶梯度在一阶梯度上的投影(PSF)，并自适应地重用PSF和及时更新PSF。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上，ARSAM达到与SAM相当的准确率，速度提升约40%，并在姿态估计、模型量化等挑战任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ARSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时显著加速训练，具有广泛实用性。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型在概念捕获能力上存在局限，仅依赖最终层特征而忽视浅层和多尺度特征，且缺乏有效的概念编码指导，阻碍了细粒度概念提取。

Method: 提出概念提示和聚合框架，包含概念感知嵌入生成器从视觉编码器各层提取概念表示，以及概念提示调优机制来放大关键概念相关的视觉线索，最后聚合各层视觉表示与文本概念表示对齐。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，CoPA超越了现有最先进方法，有效捕获和利用了图像中的概念信息。

Conclusion: CoPA框架通过多层概念提取和提示引导机制，显著提升了概念捕获能力和疾病诊断性能，为临床诊断提供了更透明的深度学习模型。

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/yihengd/CoPA.

Method: 在包含真实血管分割标注的大规模3D医学数据集上，应用ZFP压缩技术的误差容忍和固定速率两种模式，并与未压缩基准进行分割质量对比。

Result: ZFP实现了显著的数据缩减（最高22.89:1压缩比），同时保持了高保真度，平均Dice系数保持在0.87656（基准为0.8774）。

Conclusion: ZFP是一种可行且强大的工具，能够促进大规模医学数据集的高效和可访问性研究，推动更广泛的社区协作。

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the
community.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in
segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support
reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart
city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly
costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for
automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

Motivation: 解决非配对图像转换中缺乏对齐样本的问题，利用扩散模型处理复杂数据分布的能力和对比学习保持语义一致性的优势。

Method: 使用SimCLR训练时间相关的对比学习模型，将图像与其领域不变特征作为正样本对，然后利用学习到的对比模型指导预训练SDE进行图像转换。

Result: 在三个常见非配对图像转换任务上与多个基线方法比较，使用四个评估指标，在多个指标上达到与最先进方法相当的结果，且收敛更快、无需标签监督或分类器训练。

Conclusion: Contrastive-SDE是一种更高效的非配对图像转换替代方案，结合了对比学习和扩散模型的优势，在保持性能的同时提高了训练效率。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

TL;DR: LIBERO-PRO是一个扩展的VLA模型基准测试，通过四种扰动维度（操纵对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境）系统评估模型性能，发现现有模型在标准测试中表现优异但在泛化设置下性能崩溃，揭示了模型依赖记忆而非真正理解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LIBERO基准测试的训练和评估设置存在问题，导致性能估计过高且无法公平比较模型。需要更严格的评估方法来测试模型的泛化能力和真实理解水平。

Method: 引入LIBERO-PRO基准，通过四种扰动维度（操纵对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境）对模型进行系统性评估，观察模型在合理扰动下的表现变化。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中达到90%以上准确率，但在泛化设置下性能崩溃至0.0%。模型表现出对训练集中动作序列和环境布局的死记硬背，而非真正的任务理解。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在严重缺陷，模型依赖记忆而非理解。呼吁社区放弃误导性方法，采用能稳健评估模型泛化和理解能力的测试标准。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像越来越难以被标准检测器识别，但人类仍能辨别。研究旨在填补这一检测差距，并探索LVLMs作为人类判断替代品在可解释检测中的潜力。

Method: 构建了包含多样化AI生成图像的Mirage数据集，这些图像具有可见伪影但现有检测方法失败。然后评估LVLMs在该数据集和现有基准数据集上的检测性能。

Result: LVLMs在检测具有可见伪影的AI生成图像方面非常有效，但在面对缺乏此类线索的图像时性能下降。

Conclusion: LVLMs在可解释AI图像检测方面具有潜力，特别是在处理具有可见伪影的图像时，但对于更逼真的生成图像仍需改进检测方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to
identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify
this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a
diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where
current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

### [57] [UGround: Towards Unified Visual Grounding with Unrolled Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03853)
*Rui Qian,Xin Yin,Chuanhang Deng,Zhiyuan Peng,Jian Xiong,Wei Zhai,Dejing Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UGround提出了一种统一的视觉定位范式，通过动态选择Transformer中间层作为“掩码提示”，解决了现有方法依赖固定最后一层和使用<SEG>作为提示的两个主要问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在两个关键问题：1）依赖固定的最后一隐藏层，导致误差逐层累积而无法中间修正；2）使用<SEG>作为提示，将文本嵌入隐式投影到视觉空间而缺乏明确的空间线索。

Method: 采用Policy-Prompted Masking方法，包含两个核心组件：随机跳跃连接(SSC)和掩码作为提示(MasP)。SSC通过强化学习策略让<SEG>令牌在Transformer层间滑动，动态选择连接视觉模型的层；MasP则利用相似度图作为软逻辑掩码来提示SAM生成掩码。

Result: UGround首次在单一框架内统一了从传统参考表达式分割到推理分割、从单目标到多目标、从正查询到错误前提的各种视觉定位任务。

Conclusion: UGround通过动态层选择和明确的掩码提示机制，有效解决了现有视觉定位方法的局限性，提供了一个统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the
effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding
within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from
traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning
segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise
(empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: OMG4是一个优化压缩4D高斯泼溅表示的方法，通过三阶段渐进式剪枝和隐式外观压缩，显著减少模型存储大小超过60%同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D高斯泼溅表示虽然能实时渲染复杂动态场景，但需要数百万个高斯函数导致存储开销巨大，现有方法在压缩比或视觉质量上仍有局限。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式剪枝：高斯采样识别关键基元、高斯剪枝去除冗余、高斯合并融合相似特征；结合隐式外观压缩和广义子向量量化技术。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，OMG4显著优于现有最优方法，模型大小减少超过60%同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: OMG4在紧凑4D场景表示方面迈出重要一步，为广泛应用开辟新可能性。

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 传统目标检测模型在固定类别集上训练，缺乏灵活性且扩展新类别成本高。开放词汇目标检测能够识别未见类别，但地面视图预训练模型直接迁移到航拍图像因领域偏移、视角变化和尺度差异而效果不佳

Method: 引入对比图像-图像对齐增强航拍与地面视图嵌入的相似性，采用多实例词汇关联对齐航拍图像与文本嵌入

Result: 在xView、DOTAv2、VisDrone、DIOR和HRRSD数据集上验证，零样本设置下相比微调的封闭词汇模型，在DOTAv2提升+6.32 mAP，VisDrone提升+4.16 mAP，HRRSD提升+3.46 mAP

Conclusion: 该方法为航拍应用提供了更灵活和可扩展的目标检测系统

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

Motivation: GAN在资源受限设备上部署困难，知识蒸馏是有效的压缩方法，但学生生成器与教师判别器之间的容量不匹配导致训练困难

Method: 提出SDAKD方法，引入学生判别器缓解容量不匹配，采用三阶段训练策略，并在后两个阶段集成适配的特征图蒸馏方法

Result: 在GCFSR和Real-ESRGAN两个超分辨率GAN上评估，相比基线和SOTA GAN知识蒸馏方法取得一致改进

Conclusion: SDAKD是有效的GAN蒸馏方法，能缓解容量不匹配问题，在超分辨率任务上表现优异

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in
generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational
requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices.
While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly
available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a
comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However,
existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development
of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in
AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D
dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for
ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from
medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative
process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and
complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical
dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource
tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development
of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to
being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection,
compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of
users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans
becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale
dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32
high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机辅助皮肤癌诊断提供了更有效和高效的解决方案，通过自适应特征融合增强了特征学习能力并减少了噪声影响。

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature
learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings
demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient
solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

Method: 使用稀疏3D路径点作为中间表示，VLM生成粗略的3D路径点，通用动作专家通过采样实时点云观测将其细化为密集可执行动作序列，采用"动作预训练、点云微调"的训练范式。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过引入通用动作专家和3D轨迹中间表示，有效解决了VLA模型在物理世界中的泛化问题，实现了更好的跨任务训练和部署能力。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their potential for zero-shot
fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise
differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We
present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image

TL;DR: 该论文对自动驾驶感知系统中的去雾方法进行了系统性实证研究，评估了传统滤波器、现代去雾网络、链式组合以及视觉语言模型等多种方法在雾天条件下的图像质量和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶感知系统在雾天条件下特别脆弱，现有的去雾方法在图像保真度上的改进并不总能转化为更好的检测和分割性能，且先前评估多依赖合成数据，真实世界适用性存疑。

Method: 使用Foggy Cityscapes数据集，系统评估了传统滤波器、现代去雾网络、链式组合（滤波器→模型、模型→滤波器）以及基于提示的视觉语言图像编辑模型等多种去雾流水线。

Result: 分析揭示了去雾何时有效、链式组合何时产生协同或退化效应，以及VLM编辑模型与专用方法的比较。VLM法官评分与任务指标（特别是mAP）显示出强相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为去雾方法建立了透明、任务导向的基准，并明确了在何种条件下预处理能真正改善恶劣天气下的自动驾驶感知性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy
conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

TL;DR: CAMEO是一个用于通用人体运动视频生成的分层框架，通过桥接文本到运动模型和条件视频扩散模型，解决了训练和推理中的次优因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频扩散模型发展迅速，但在通用人体视频生成方面的应用仍未被充分探索，大多数工作局限于图像到视频设置或舞蹈视频等狭窄领域。

Method: 提出CAMEO框架，分析并准备文本提示和视觉条件来有效训练视频扩散模型，引入相机感知条件模块连接两个阶段，自动选择与输入文本对齐的视角。

Result: 在MovieGen基准和新引入的T2M-VDM组合基准上证明了方法的有效性，展示了其在不同用例中的多功能性。

Conclusion: CAMEO框架能够无缝桥接文本到运动模型和条件视频扩散模型，通过精心设计的组件增强了运动描述、条件信号和生成视频之间的鲁棒对齐。

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad
applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid
progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式VPS无法覆盖私人室内空间，存在隐私担忧、监管限制和维护瓶颈。需要一种分布式解决方案来扩大覆盖范围并保护隐私。

Method: 采用联邦图像定位概念，各组织独立3D扫描和维护自己的VPS服务，通过参考解决方案管理和合并跨地图数据而不共享私有数据。

Result: 实现了分布式VPS后端，支持室内3D扫描的访问控制、分布式维护和更大覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 联邦VPS方法能够解决集中式系统的局限性，促进更大范围的AR定位覆盖，同时保护隐私和实现分布式维护。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

Motivation: 现有系统虽然整合了生物力学运动线索和深度学习技术，但未能将生物力学洞察转化为对球员和教练既易于理解又有意义的可操作语言反馈。

Method: 使用CNN-LSTM模型从运动数据中提取关键生物力学特征（如关节角度、肢体速度和动力链模式），分析这些特征与击球效果和受伤风险的关系，并基于此利用大型语言模型生成反馈。

Result: 该框架在THETIS数据集上进行了评估，重点关注分类性能和可解释性，旨在弥合可解释AI与运动生物力学之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种新颖的框架，能够生成技术上准确、基于生物力学且对最终用户可操作的反馈，为网球击球分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the
integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques,
enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在需要细粒度时间理解的任务上表现不佳，主要原因是微调数据集缺乏视觉复杂性和时间细节，导致模型过度依赖语言推理而非真正理解视频动态。

Method: 提出TimeWarp方法，系统性地创建目标合成时间数据集来微调模型响应，使其专注于输入视频。引入大规模偏好数据集，捕捉常被忽略的复杂时间动态，将模型响应锚定在视觉和时间信息上。

Result: 应用该方法后，现有模型在时间理解基准测试中的性能显著提升，在七个基准测试中实现了绝对性能改进。

Conclusion: TimeWarp方法通过针对性数据集有效提升了视频大语言模型的时间理解能力，证明了所提数据集在推进视频大语言模型时间理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在生物医学视觉语言模型中扩展文本编码器上下文长度的影响，发现长上下文训练能显著提升检索和分类性能，并提出了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集和BMC-LongCLIP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型通常使用短文本窗口（<77个token）进行预训练，这导致长格式生物医学描述被截断。然而，大规模开源文献中的生物医学描述有很大部分远超77个token，因此需要研究长上下文训练对模型性能的影响。

Method: 扩展视觉语言模型中文本编码器的上下文长度，创建BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集（包含100万张图像-描述对，具有来自全文文章的上下文感知描述），并训练BMC-LongCLIP模型，其文本编码器支持最多512个token的窗口。

Result: BMC-LongCLIP将上下文容量扩展了6.6倍，token浪费从55%减少到2.2%。在长描述检索基准测试中，Recall@1实现了高达+30%的绝对增益，分类平均提升+2%，且收敛速度比短上下文模型更快。

Conclusion: 长上下文建模是推进生物医学视觉语言模型发展的有前景方向，能够有效利用长格式描述中的额外监督信息，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

Motivation: 现有长尾半监督学习方法假设未标记数据遵循预定义分布，但实际中未标记数据的分布通常是未知且任意的，这限制了现有方法的性能

Method: 提出可控伪标签生成框架，包含动态可控过滤机制、基于贝叶斯最优分类器的logit调整、类感知自适应增强模块和辅助分支，通过自增强优化循环逐步识别可靠伪标签

Result: 在多个常用基准数据集上的综合评估显示，CPG实现了持续改进，超越最先进方法达15.97%准确率

Conclusion: CPG框架能有效处理未标记数据分布未知的长尾半监督学习问题，通过可控伪标签生成和已知分布更新显著提升模型性能

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有OCR系统在处理越南历史文献中的退化扫描、非标准字形和手写变体时表现不佳，影响古典中文文本的数字化和跨语言语义研究。

Method: 使用精选的越南古典中文手稿子集对PaddleOCRv5的文本识别模块进行微调，构建完整的训练流程包括预处理、LMDB转换、评估和可视化。

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital
role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual
semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans,
non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In
this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve
character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module
using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by
a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation,
and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the
base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent,
particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an
interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition
results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic
alignment, machine translation, and historical linguistics research. The demo

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示在信号表示方面表现出色，但不适用于需要学习语义结构的预测任务如分割。本文旨在解决INRs在医学图像分割中的适用性问题。

Method: 使用一个基础INR同时预测像素强度值和类别标签，通过元学习过程在训练数据集上找到最优初始参数，使INR能够快速微调以适应未见过的测试图像。

Result: 在2D和3D脑MRI分割任务上评估，Dice分数与常用的U-Net模型相当，但参数减少了90%。

Conclusion: MetaSeg为医学图像分割提供了一个新颖、可扩展的替代方案，相比传统的资源密集型架构如U-Net和视觉变换器更具优势。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in
learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not
naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must
learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we
introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image
segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per
pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure
to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer
parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional
resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical
image segmentation. Our project is available at

Motivation: 解决长视频问答中计算效率低下的问题，传统方法需要处理大量帧，计算成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 低帧率浏览定位问题相关时间片段；2) 高帧率下进行span感知的token重新分配来回答问题；使用端到端训练和交错组相对目标函数。

Result: 在固定token预算下，ViTL在长视频问答和时间定位任务上达到8.6%的性能提升，同时减少50%的帧输入；span感知的token重新分配始终优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: ViTL和配套数据集提供了一个可解释、计算高效的解决方案，适用于可扩展的长视频问答任务。

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA
framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing}
question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via
span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate,
emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct
attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based
event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each
question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is
trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples
temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow
from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token
budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and
temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations
show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform
sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable,
compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

Motivation: 现有假新闻检测器因训练数据有限且多样性不足，导致模式偏差和性能受限。真实场景中视频素材与虚假新闻事件存在复杂多对多关系，但现有数据集未能充分反映这种关系。

Method: 使用多LLM驱动流水线模拟四种假新闻创作类别，结合基于不确定性采样的主动学习策略选择有用的增强样本。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，AgentAug能持续提升短视频假新闻检测器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAug框架通过数据增强有效解决了假新闻视频检测中的数据稀疏问题，提高了检测器的泛化能力。

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation
to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now
leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition
has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results,
such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the
precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by
exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of
the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better
adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing
limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding
and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中，仅使用18.5K训练样本就达到52.8%的准确率，超越了V2P-7B（50.6%，使用9.6M样本）和GTA-1-7B（50.1%，使用1.56M样本）。

Conclusion: GUI-Spotlight通过专门的工具调用和迭代聚焦方法，显著提高了视觉基础准确性，为GUI系统提供了更可靠的指针级操作能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the
competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond
controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse
platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of
visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements.
This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level
actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight
-- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes
multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant
region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding
accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only
18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with
9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Result: 在ResNet系列模型和Inception-v3模型上的实验表明，该方法在图像分类任务中的top-1准确率普遍优于现有技术，8位和6位量化几乎无精度损失，4位量化的准确率也显著提升。

Conclusion: 提出的范围估计方法能够有效提升后训练量化的性能，特别是在低比特设置下保持模型精度方面表现优异。

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network
models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However,
low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization
performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into
an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local
minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search
algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above
search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in
practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image
classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

*Zhenyu Pan,Yucheng Lu,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaFind是一个面向元宇宙场景生成的三模态组合检索框架，通过从大规模存储库中检索3D资产来解决资产检索中的空间、语义和风格一致性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D资产检索方法存在的两个核心问题：(i) 忽视空间、语义和风格约束的不一致资产检索；(ii) 缺乏专门为3D资产检索设计的标准化检索范式。

Method: 提出灵活的检索机制，支持文本、图像和3D模态的任意组合查询，通过ESSGNN等变布局编码器联合建模对象级特征和场景级布局结构，确保检索结果与现有场景在上下文和风格上的一致性。

Result: 经验评估表明，MetaFind在各种检索任务中相比基线方法具有更好的空间和风格一致性。

Conclusion: MetaFind通过三模态组合检索和等变布局编码，有效提升了3D资产检索的空间推理和风格一致性，支持迭代式场景构建。

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework
supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval
results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the
improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval
tasks compared to baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的损失函数，将耀斑子类间的序数信息整合到二元交叉熵损失中，以解决传统二元分类忽略耀斑强度序数关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统耀斑预测的二元分类框架忽略了FL和NF类别内子类之间的序数关系，且模型在预测阈值附近最容易出现误分类。

Method: 在传统二元交叉熵损失基础上，整合耀斑子类的序数信息，作为序数感知的数据驱动正则化方法，对阈值附近的错误预测施加更重的惩罚。

Result: 该方法通过利用数据的序数特性增强模型学习过程，旨在提高整体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的序数加权损失函数能够更好地处理耀斑预测中阈值附近的分类困难，改善模型性能。

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QuantDemoire的后训练量化框架，专门用于去摩尔纹任务，通过异常值感知量化器和频率感知校准策略，在保持质量的同时大幅减少参数和计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习去摩尔纹方法需要大量计算资源，难以在边缘设备上部署。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重的性能下降，主要原因是分布异常值和平滑区域表示弱化。

Method: QuantDemoire包含两个关键组件：1）异常值感知量化器，使用基于采样的范围估计减少激活异常值，并将少量极端权重保留为FP16；2）频率感知校准策略，在微调过程中强调低中频分量，减轻低比特量化引起的带状伪影。

Result: 在W4A4配置下，QuantDemoire比现有量化方法性能提升超过4 dB，同时大幅减少了参数和计算量。

Conclusion: QuantDemoire为去摩尔纹模型提供了一种有效的后训练量化解决方案，在保持图像质量的同时实现了高效的边缘部署。

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极稀疏视图下CT重建的病态问题和纹理丢失问题，结合生成先验和物理约束提高重建质量。

Method: 结合扩散生成先验(NCSN++ SDE模型)与多正则化约束(各向异性TV和核范数LoRA)，采用ADMM框架，使用2D切片策略配合FFT加速和并行优化。

Result: 在AAPM-2016、CTHD和LIDC数据集上，TV-LoRA在SSIM、纹理恢复、边缘清晰度和伪影抑制方面均优于基准方法，展现强鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: TV-LoRA在低剂量稀疏采样场景下实现了高保真、高效的3D CT重建，具有广泛的临床应用前景。

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are
released at https://github.com/boomluo02/EEMFlowPlus.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的6D物体姿态估计方法存在训练收敛慢、需要端到端学习编码器、以及需要额外网络来过滤低质量姿态候选的问题。

Method: 1. 预训练编码器并使用直接姿态回归头，联合学习回归头和去噪扩散头；2. 提出基于时间相关分数缩放的采样指导，有效平衡探索-利用权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，通过预训练编码器和采样指导策略，显著提升了6D物体姿态估计的性能和效率。

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

Conclusion: 基于概念漂移理论的自主蒸馏方法能有效解决多教师推理轨迹漂移问题，产生稳健、一致且可泛化的模型。

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

Motivation: 传统建筑安全检查方法效率低下，需要处理大量信息。现有应用存在响应不相关、模态输入受限和幻觉问题，LLM应用受限于训练数据和实时适应性。

Method: 开发了SiteShield多模态LVLM RAG框架，整合视觉和音频输入，用于自动化建筑安全检查报告生成。

Result: 在真实数据上，SiteShield的F1得分为0.82，汉明损失为0.04，精确率为0.76，召回率为0.96，优于无RAG的单模态LLM。

Conclusion: SiteShield为增强信息检索和安全报告生成效率提供了一条新途径。

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as
they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in
generating safety reports.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易学习训练数据中的虚假相关性（偏置），而现有方法需要已知偏置或偏置冲突样本，这在现实场景中往往不切实际。

Method: 首先训练生成模型在偏置域间翻译图像并保留任务相关特征，然后基于图像对偏置的敏感性自适应精炼图像与其合成对应物，通过对齐任务相关特征但偏置不同的图像来鼓励鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于最先进方法，在corrupted CIFAR-10数据集的最差组设置下比最接近的基线绝对提升约18%。

Conclusion: BLADE为无需显式监督开发更鲁棒的深度学习模型建立了新基准，展示了强大的偏置缓解潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在关键安全应用中缺乏可解释性和可信度，现有概念瓶颈模型需要昂贵的概念标注且缺乏空间定位能力。

Method: 集成概念引导图像分割到注意力多实例学习框架，将分割区域作为实例，学习跨区域证据聚合，实现语义区域推理。

Conclusion: SEG-MIL-CBM通过语义区域推理实现了无需标注的透明概念解释，在保持性能的同时提高了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

Motivation: 扩散变换器的迭代采样过程由于每个时间步都需要进行昂贵的变换器前向传播而成为主要瓶颈，现有特征缓存方法采用统一策略忽略了特征维度的异质动态行为。

Method: 将隐藏特征演化建模为跨维度的ODE混合，引入HyCa框架应用维度级缓存策略，基于混合ODE求解器思想。

Conclusion: HyCa通过维度级缓存策略有效加速扩散变换器采样，在多个领域和模型上实现近无损的高速性能提升。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their
performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or

introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

### [96] [MASC: Boosting Autoregressive Image Generation with a Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04220)
*Lixuan He,Shikang Zheng,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MASC框架，通过构建层次化语义树来结构化视觉标记的预测空间，显著提升自回归模型的训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型使用平坦的无结构视觉标记词汇表，忽略了标记嵌入空间的内在结构，导致预测任务复杂，训练效率低下且生成质量受限。

Method: MASC框架使用几何感知距离度量和密度驱动的凝聚构建方法，直接从码本内在结构构建层次化语义树，将高维平坦预测任务转化为结构化层次任务。

Result: 训练速度提升最高达57%，LlamaGen-XL的FID从2.87降至2.58，显著改善生成质量，使现有自回归框架与最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 结构化预测空间对于可扩展生成建模与架构创新同等重要，MASC作为即插即用模块能有效提升自回归模型的性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet
they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a
vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

TL;DR: ZoomIn是一个两阶段取证框架，通过模仿人类视觉检查，先扫描图像定位可疑区域，然后对这些放大区域进行聚焦分析，提高AI生成图像检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的快速增长模糊了真实与合成内容的边界，对数字完整性构成严重威胁。现有的视觉语言模型虽然提供可解释性，但在检测高质量合成图像中的细微伪影方面表现不足。

Method: 提出ZoomIn两阶段取证框架：第一阶段扫描图像定位可疑区域，第二阶段对这些放大区域进行聚焦分析。创建了MagniFake数据集（20,000张真实和高质量合成图像，带有边界框和取证解释），通过自动化VLM流程生成训练数据。

Result: 方法达到96.39%的准确率，具有强大的泛化能力，并提供基于视觉证据的人类可理解解释。

Conclusion: ZoomIn框架在AI生成图像检测方面实现了高准确性和可解释性，通过模仿人类视觉检查过程，为数字取证提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between
real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity.
Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but
often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We
propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and
interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an
image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on
these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we
introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images
annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an
automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust
generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in
visual evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像配准问题，即找到使两幅图像对应点位置一致的变换，需要一个简单易实现且对训练资源要求低的解决方案。

Method: 开发了端到端可训练的算法，仅需少量Python代码即可实现，使用74张图像在19x15输入窗口上进行训练，适用于立体视觉等应用场景。

Result: 该算法在训练数据和训练时间有限的情况下仍能获得准确结果，代码简洁（仅需十几行Python），在相关受限场景中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该算法在代码简洁性、训练数据需求和训练时间方面具有优势，可作为训练数据、训练时间或代码复杂度受限场景的良好起点。

Abstract: The problem of image registration is finding a transformation that aligns two
images, such that the corresponding points are in the same location. This paper
introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a
few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little
training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some
settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on
a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm
excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with
limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ArConv的新型卷积层，通过重新设计和优化卷积层来创建轻量级神经网络模型，该模型仅含130万参数，在RfMiD数据集上表现优于MobileNetV2，准确率达到0.9328。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高深度神经网络的可访问性，使其能够在移动设备上运行，特别是在眼科疾病诊断等医疗应用领域，通过降低计算复杂度来扩大神经网络的应用范围。

Method: 在基础层面重新设计和优化卷积层，开发了新型ArConv卷积层，构建了一个通用的轻量级模型架构，参数数量仅为130万。

Result: 在RfMiD数据集上的测试显示，该模型准确率达到0.9328，优于具有220万参数的MobileNetV2模型（准确率0.9266），同时保持了较低的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过创新的ArConv层设计，成功开发了适用于移动设备的轻量级神经网络模型，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，为医疗诊断等应用提供了更易访问的解决方案。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts
aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing
accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on
the RfMiD test set.

TL;DR: Kaleido是一个用于照片级真实感神经渲染的生成模型，将3D视为视频的特殊子域，通过序列到序列的图像合成实现生成式视图合成，无需显式3D表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统神经渲染方法对显式3D表示和稀缺相机标注数据的依赖，通过统一3D和视频建模框架，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练。

Method: 采用序列到序列的生成式神经渲染，使用掩码自回归框架和整流流变换器，能够基于任意数量的参考视图生成任意数量的6自由度目标视图。

Result: 在多个视图合成基准测试中达到最先进水平，零样本性能在少视图设置中显著优于其他生成方法，在多视图设置中首次达到逐场景优化方法的水平。

Conclusion: Kaleido通过将3D建模统一到视频框架中，实现了高质量的生成式神经渲染，减少了对稀缺3D数据的依赖，同时保持了出色的性能。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for
photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido
operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain
of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task.
Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural
rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to:
i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

TL;DR: 提出CoSSeg-TTA框架，在nnU-Netv2基础上结合半监督学习和领域适应技术，用于Gd-EOB-DTPA增强MRI的肝脏分割，在低标注条件下实现优异的跨域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对比增强MRI肝脏分割面临的标注数据有限、增强方案异质性和跨扫描仪/机构的领域偏移问题。传统图像翻译方法存在结构扭曲、训练不稳定等局限。

Method: 基于nnU-Netv2构建紧凑分割框架，采用半监督均值教师方案利用未标注数据，集成随机直方图风格转换和可训练对比感知网络的领域适应模块，并使用持续测试时适应策略。

Result: 在广泛实验中，框架持续优于nnU-Netv2基线，获得更高的Dice分数和更优的Hausdorff距离，在低标注条件下对未见领域表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoSSeg-TTA通过半监督学习、领域适应和测试时适应策略，有效解决了单模态MRI肝脏分割中的领域泛化挑战，为临床诊断和治疗规划提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念解释的对抗性补丁防御方法，无需预先知道补丁大小或位置，通过抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量来中和补丁影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性补丁防御方法通常需要预先知道补丁大小或位置，这限制了它们的实际应用。

Method: 利用基于概念的解释来识别和抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量，从而在不进行显式检测的情况下中和补丁效果。

Result: 在Imagenette数据集和ResNet-50上的评估显示，该方法在鲁棒性和干净准确率方面均优于最先进的PatchCleanser方法，并在不同补丁大小和位置下保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与鲁棒性相结合具有前景，概念驱动的防御策略是对抗对抗性补丁攻击的可扩展方法。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by
forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often
realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior
knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based
explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation
vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection.
Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and
clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了Adapt-STformer方法，使用循环可变形Transformer编码器实现灵活高效的序列视觉地点识别，在保持高性能的同时显著提升效率和灵活性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的Seq-VPR方法在追求性能时牺牲了灵活性和效率，无法满足实际应用中序列长度可变、快速推理和低内存占用的需求

Method: 提出Adapt-STformer方法，核心是循环可变形Transformer编码器(Recurrent-DTE)，通过迭代循环机制融合多帧序列信息，支持可变序列长度

Result: 在Nordland、Oxford和NuScenes数据集上，召回率提升高达17%，序列提取时间减少36%，内存使用降低35%

Conclusion: Adapt-STformer在保持高性能的同时，实现了灵活性、快速推理和低内存占用的平衡，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

Motivation: 现有大型生成模型在图像编辑和上下文图像生成方面取得进展，但在确保物理一致性方面存在关键差距，这对于世界模拟相关任务尤为重要。

Method: 将输入和编辑图像视为视频的首尾帧，利用预训练视频生成模型；引入时序推理阶段，在推理时联合去噪目标帧和推理令牌，想象合理的编辑轨迹。

Conclusion: ChronoEdit通过将图像编辑重新定义为视频生成问题，有效解决了物理一致性问题，为需要物理一致性的应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病的客观步态评估受限于缺乏大规模、多样化且临床标注的运动数据集。

Method: 将RGB视频或运动捕捉数据通过统一预处理流程转换为匿名SMPL网格，支持监督临床评分预测和无监督运动预训练任务。

Result: 运动编码器始终优于手工特征，在CARE-PD上预训练可将MPJPE从60.8mm降至7.5mm，并将PD严重程度宏F1提高17个百分点。

Conclusion: CARE-PD证明了临床策划的多样化训练数据的价值，所有数据和基准代码已公开供非商业研究使用。

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial

TL;DR: GenAR是一个多尺度自回归框架，通过从粗到细的方式预测空间转录组数据，将基因聚类为层次组以捕捉基因间依赖关系，直接预测原始计数，并在解码时融合组织学和空间嵌入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组技术成本高昂，而从广泛可用的H&E染色图像预测基因表达是一种经济有效的替代方案。现有计算方法通常独立预测每个基因，忽略了共表达结构，并将任务视为连续回归，而表达实际上是离散计数，这会导致生物学上不合理的输出并复杂化下游分析。

Method: GenAR采用多尺度自回归框架，将基因聚类为层次组以暴露跨基因依赖关系，将表达建模为无码本的离散标记生成来直接预测原始计数，并在解码时条件化融合的组织学和空间嵌入。

Result: 在四个不同组织类型的空间转录组数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，GenAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GenAR通过离散公式避免了对数诱导的偏差，粗到细的分解与原则性的条件分解相一致，为精准医学和经济有效的分子分析提供了潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 模仿学习训练的端到端驾驶策略缺乏恢复数据，小错误会快速累积导致失败。现有方法使用神经渲染或游戏引擎创建数字孪生，但成本高、速度慢，主要用于评估而非训练。

Method: 提出3D栅格化方法，用轻量级栅格化替代昂贵渲染，支持反事实恢复操作和跨智能体视图合成。引入栅格到真实特征空间对齐来弥合仿真与现实差距。

Result: RAP在NAVSIM v1/v2、Waymo开放数据集视觉端到端驾驶和Bench2Drive四个主要基准测试中排名第一，实现了最先进的闭环鲁棒性和长尾泛化能力。

Conclusion: 轻量级栅格化结合特征对齐足以扩展端到端训练，为照片级渲染提供了实用替代方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中（如盲区突然出现的行人）往往缺乏足够的观测数据，导致准确预测困难，增加了交通事故风险。

Method: 使用两个序列连接的扩散模型：一个用于生成未观测的历史轨迹，另一个用于预测未来轨迹。设计了双头参数化机制估计不确定性，以及时间自适应噪声模块动态调节前向扩散过程的噪声尺度。

Result: 在ETH/UCY和Stanford Drone数据集上达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2框架能够有效处理瞬时轨迹预测问题，显著提升了交通安全性。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphoSim是一个语言引导的4D场景生成框架，能够创建多视角一致且支持对象级控制的动态环境，通过轨迹引导生成和特征场蒸馏实现交互式编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型局限于2D视图且交互性有限，需要能够生成可控可编辑的时空环境来支持机器人应用，如可扩展训练数据、可重复评估和灵活任务设计。

Method: 集成轨迹引导生成与特征场蒸馏，从自然语言指令生成4D场景，支持对象控制、重新着色、移除等操作，并允许从任意视角观察场景。

Result: 实验表明MorphoSim在保持高场景保真度的同时实现了可控性和可编辑性，能够在不完全重新生成的情况下进行交互式编辑。

Conclusion: MorphoSim为机器人应用提供了可控可编辑的4D场景生成能力，支持多视角一致性和对象级控制，代码已开源。

Abstract: World models that support controllable
  and editable spatiotemporal environments are valuable
  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and
flexible task design. While
  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are
constrained to 2D views and offer limited
  interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that
generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates
  trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits
to be applied interactively
  without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high
scene fidelity while enabling
  controllability and editability. The code is available

*Xuyang Guo,Zekai Huang,Zhenmei Shi,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLMCountBench基准测试，发现现有视觉语言模型在单一形状计数任务中表现可靠，但在组合形状计数任务中存在显著失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但它们在计数能力方面的基本性能尚未得到系统评估。本文旨在探究VLMs能否正确计数对象。

Method: 设计了一个简约的基准测试VLMCountBench，仅使用基本几何形状及其组合，在严格控制变量的条件下系统研究颜色、大小和提示词优化等因素的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，VLMs在单一形状类型计数时表现可靠，但在组合形状类型计数时出现显著失败，暴露了当前模型的组合计数能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在组合计数任务中存在根本性局限，这为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodeFormer++是一个新颖的盲脸修复框架，通过分解任务为身份保护修复、高质量生成和动态融合三个子任务，解决了现有方法在视觉质量和身份保真度之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲脸修复方法在集成生成先验时，往往面临视觉质量与身份保真度之间的权衡，导致身份失真或降质去除不理想。

Method: 提出三个关键贡献：(1)基于学习的可变形人脸配准模块进行语义对齐；(2)纹理引导修复网络动态提取和传递生成人脸的纹理；(3)集成深度度量学习，生成信息丰富的正负样本以更好地融合身份保护和生成特征。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的广泛实验表明，CodeFormer++在视觉保真度和身份一致性方面均取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: CodeFormer++框架成功最大化生成先验的效用，实现了高质量人脸修复同时保持身份特征。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A.I.R.方法，通过自适应、迭代和基于推理的帧选择策略，在视频问答任务中平衡计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前视频问答中帧选择方法的两难问题：轻量级相似度模型无法处理复杂查询，而使用VLM进行深度分析又计算成本过高。

Method: 利用强大的VLM对复杂查询进行深度语义分析，在低成本迭代循环中仅处理小批量的高潜力帧。

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中表现优于现有帧选择方法，显著提升基础VLM性能，并大幅提高计算效率。

Conclusion: A.I.R.方法有效解决了帧选择中的准确性与效率权衡问题，为视频问答任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

*Qiyuan He,Yicong Li,Haotian Ye,Jinghao Wang,Xinyao Liao,Pheng-Ann Heng,Stefano Ermon,James Zou,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了reAR训练策略，通过引入token-wise正则化目标来解决自回归视觉生成中的生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归生成性能落后于扩散模型，核心瓶颈在于生成器与分词器之间的不一致性，即AR生成的token可能无法被分词器良好解码。

Method: 提出reAR训练策略，在预测下一个token时，因果变换器同时学习恢复当前token的视觉嵌入，并在噪声上下文中预测目标token的嵌入。无需改变分词器、生成顺序、推理流程或外部模型。

Result: 在ImageNet上，gFID从3.02降至1.86，IS提升至316.9。应用于先进分词器时，仅用177M参数就达到gFID 1.42，与675M参数的最先进扩散模型性能相当。

Conclusion: reAR是一种简单有效的训练策略，通过解决生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升了视觉自回归生成的性能，使其能够与更大的扩散模型竞争。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

TL;DR: SPEGNet提出了一种统一设计的伪装目标检测方法，通过通道校准和空间增强整合多尺度特征，直接生成边界，在保持语义-空间对齐的同时实现实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有伪装目标检测方法依赖复杂组件积累，导致计算负担增加但性能提升不成比例，且处理低分辨率时会丢失精细细节。

Method: 采用统一架构，通过通道校准和空间增强整合多尺度特征，边界直接从上下文丰富的表示中产生，保持语义-空间对齐，渐进式细化实现尺度自适应边缘调制。

Result: 在CAMO数据集上达到0.887 Sα，COD10K上0.890，NC4K上0.895，具有实时推理速度。

Conclusion: SPEGNet在边界精度和区域一致性之间取得平衡，能够处理从微小复杂目标到大型模式相似目标的多种尺度，同时处理遮挡和模糊边界。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and
edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex
components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,
pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries. Code,
model weights, and results are available on

Result: 实验结果表明，MedCLM在多个医学VQA基准测试中达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: MedCLM为开发临床对齐的医学视觉语言模型提供了一个可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in
medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts
detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA)
data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ
segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical
vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step
reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated
CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes
for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and
a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA
benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned
medical vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文化遗产等专业领域面临数据稀缺和领域知识不足的问题，特别是在3D花瓶文物分析方面表现不佳。

Method: 构建了包含664个古希腊花瓶3D模型及对应问答数据的VaseVQA-3D数据集，并开发了VaseVLM模型通过领域自适应训练提升性能。

Result: 在VaseVQA-3D数据集上，R@1指标提升12.8%，词汇相似度提升6.6%，显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了3D花瓶文物的识别和理解能力，为数字文化遗产保护研究提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in
multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly
in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when
dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts,
existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain
knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs
struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks.
To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as
the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery
analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding
question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We
further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact
analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by
6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the
VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding
of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage
preservation research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用图像生成和编辑模型在电商场景中存在一致性限制，无法很好地保持产品外观和布局的完整性。

Method: 1) 建立全面的数据构建流水线；2) 设计包含基础模型、模式转换模块和一致性增强模块的分层模型框架；3) 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段进行编辑模式转换，第二阶段进行一致性增强。

Conclusion: TBStar-Edit成功解决了电商领域图像编辑的一致性问题，为电商应用提供了专门的图像编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled
state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains.
However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often
encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce
TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain.
Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training
strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while
maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for
data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline,
encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to
acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing
data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first
stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency
enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate
datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a
self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that
TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both
objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出异步扩散模型，通过为不同像素分配不同时间步长来改善文本到图像的对齐问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用同步去噪，所有像素同时从噪声演化到清晰图像，导致提示相关区域只能参考相同噪声水平的无关区域，无法获得清晰上下文，影响文本到图像对齐效果

Method: 异步扩散模型框架，为不同像素分配不同时间步长，重新制定逐像素去噪过程，动态调节单个像素的时间步长计划，使提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪

Result: 广泛实验表明，异步扩散模型能显著提高各种提示下的文本到图像对齐效果

Conclusion: 异步扩散模型通过异步去噪机制，允许提示相关区域利用更清晰的像素间上下文，从而在最终图像中实现更好的对齐效果

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code
repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成中常出现语义不一致或幻觉问题，现有推理时引导方法通常依赖外部信号或架构修改，会引入额外计算开销。

Method: 利用中间样本作为投影基，放大分数估计相对于该基的切线分量来修正采样轨迹，基于一阶泰勒展开形式化引导过程。

Result: TAG能够将状态引导到更高概率区域，减少不一致性并提升样本质量。

Conclusion: TAG是一种即插即用、架构无关的模块，能以最小计算代价提高扩散采样保真度，为扩散引导提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image
generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations.
While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

*Honglin Liu,Chao Sun,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出条件表示学习（CRL）方法，通过用户指定的条件生成定制化特征表示，解决通用表示学习与下游任务不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习方法学习的是通用表示，主要捕捉主导语义，可能与定制化的下游任务不匹配。例如在动物栖息地分析中，研究人员关注场景相关特征，而通用嵌入强调类别语义，导致结果不理想。现有方法需要监督微调，计算和标注成本高。

Method: CRL利用LLM根据用户指定条件生成描述性文本来构建语义基，然后使用VLM将图像表示投影到这个条件特征空间中。通过揭示空间语义由其基决定，使得一组描述性词语能够近似定制化特征空间的基。

Result: 在分类和检索任务上的广泛实验证明了CRL的优越性和通用性。

Conclusion: CRL能够为任意用户指定条件提取定制化表示，更好地捕捉特定标准的语义，可用于多个定制化任务。

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

TL;DR: 开发了AI Session Recorder系统，通过记录病理学家在数字病理图像上的浏览行为，构建Pathology-CoT数据集，并基于此训练Pathologist-o3智能体，在胃肠道淋巴结转移检测中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前病理学AI系统缺乏实际可用的智能体系统，能够模拟专家诊断过程中的多阶段交互行为（如调整放大倍数、移动视野等），主要障碍是缺乏可扩展的、临床对齐的专家行为监督数据。

Method: 1. 开发AI Session Recorder，与标准WSI查看器配合，无干扰地记录常规导航行为；2. 将查看器日志转换为标准化行为命令和边界框；3. 通过轻量级人工审核创建Pathology-CoT数据集；4. 构建两阶段Pathologist-o3智能体：先提出感兴趣区域，再进行行为引导推理。

Conclusion: 该框架将日常查看器日志转化为可扩展的专家验证监督数据，使智能病理学变得实用，并为人类对齐、可升级的临床AI建立了路径。

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our
knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems
in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated
supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a
path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了SLIC和其他四种超像素分割方法在森林砍伐检测中的效果，发现通过分类器融合方法可以显著提升检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLIC算法在遥感图像分割中可能不是最优选择，需要评估其他分割方法对森林砍伐检测任务的影响。

Method: 比较了SLIC和其他四种最佳分割方法，使用PyCaret AutoML库选择前五名分类器，并应用分类器融合方法。

Result: 初始结果显示各分割方法性能差异不大，但通过分类器融合方法后，平衡准确率有明显提升。

Conclusion: 分割方法的选择和机器学习模型的组合都对森林砍伐检测任务至关重要。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications,
including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了EduPersona基准，用于评估虚拟学生代理在课堂环境中的主观能力，包含三个渐进任务：基本连贯性、学生真实性和长期角色一致性。通过实验验证了角色微调在三个任务上的显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育中的集成，虚拟学生代理在课堂模拟和教师培训中变得重要，但其课堂导向的主观能力尚未得到充分评估，限制了模型边界理解和可信部署。

Method: 构建了基于大五人格理论的大规模基准EduPersona，包含两个语言、三个学科和十种角色类型。将主观性能分解为三个渐进任务，并对三个代表性LLM进行系统实验，比较原始版本与在EduPersona上训练的十个角色微调变体。

Result: 实验结果显示在所有任务上都有持续且显著的改进：TASK1 +33.6%、TASK2 +30.6%、TASK3 +14.9%，证明了数据集的有效性和研究价值，同时揭示了角色建模的异质难度。

Conclusion: EduPersona提供了首个以主观能力为中心的课堂基准，建立了可解耦和可验证的研究范式，并将开源数据集和框架以支持教育领域可信和类人AI的发展。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层多阶段运动专家混合模型，用于从步态序列中预测心理特征，在PsyMo基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态包含丰富的生物和行为信息，但利用行走方式来推断心理特征仍是一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的问题。

Method: 采用分层多阶段运动专家混合架构，通过四个运动复杂度阶段处理行走周期，使用轻量级专家模型提取时空特征，并通过任务特定门控模块自适应加权专家。

Result: 在涵盖17个心理特征的PsyMo基准测试中，该方法在运行级别获得37.47%的加权F1分数，在受试者级别获得44.6%的分数，优于现有步态分析模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明多任务步态学习对于心理特征估计是可行的，为未来基于运动信息的心理推断研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

Motivation: 解决多概念个性化中多个学习概念在输出图像中相互干扰或混合的问题。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量实验证明，ConceptSplit能够实现稳健的多概念个性化，减轻意外的概念干扰。

Conclusion: ConceptSplit框架通过创新的训练和推理方法有效解决了多概念个性化中的概念混合问题。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了身份一致性和精细表情控制的结合，为人机交互和AI驱动的故事讲述提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

Motivation: 现有方法难以模拟真实人类反应中的随机性和动态特性，导致生成的面部反应缺乏多样性和真实感。

Method: 提出ReactDiff框架，在扩散过程中整合两个关键先验：时间面部行为运动学和面部动作单元依赖关系，以引导模型生成符合人类面部解剖学约束的逼真反应。

Conclusion: ReactDiff通过整合面部运动学和动作单元依赖关系，成功生成了多样且逼真的面部反应，为人类-计算机交互系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么多模态语言模型在感知密集型任务上表现不佳，从视觉键值令牌处理的角度提供新的研究视角。

Method: 分析流行MLMs（LLaVA-OneVision、Qwen2.5-VL、Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT）处理视觉键值令牌的方式，研究视觉信息在语言模型中的流动，并测试添加文本前缀等方法对感知能力的影响。

Result: 发现图像值令牌包含足够执行分割、语义对应等任务的零样本信息，但语言模型未能充分利用；输入无关的图像键令牌存在降低感知能力的伪影；添加文本前缀可改善视觉表示；33.3%的BLINK基准艺术风格问题中，语言模型内的感知信息未输出。

Conclusion: 揭示了键值令牌在多模态系统中的关键作用，为MLMs的机制可解释性研究开辟新方向，并建议改进视觉编码器和语言模型组件的训练方法。

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

Motivation: 现有3D语义场景图预测方法过度依赖图神经网络，但物体和关系特征的表示能力不足，特别是物体特征质量对整体场景图准确性影响很大。

Method: 设计高区分度的物体特征编码器，采用对比预训练策略将物体表示学习与场景图预测解耦，并有效结合几何和语义特征进行关系预测。

Conclusion: 通过优化物体特征表示并有效整合关系信息，该方法在3D语义场景图预测任务上取得了突破性进展，为机器人和AR/VR应用提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机陷阱广泛用于野生动物监测，但从单目图像中提取准确距离测量仍具挑战性，因为缺乏深度信息。需要系统评估MDE方法在自然野生动物环境中的性能。

Method: 在93张带有校准ChARUCO模式地面真实距离的相机陷阱图像上，评估四种最先进的MDE方法（Depth Anything V2、ML Depth Pro、ZoeDepth和Metric3D）以及几何基线方法。

Result: Depth Anything V2实现最佳整体性能，平均绝对误差0.454m，相关性0.962；ZoeDepth在户外自然环境中性能显著下降（MAE: 3.087m）；中值深度提取在所有深度学习方法中始终优于均值方法。

Conclusion: 该基准为野生动物应用建立了性能基线，并为在保护监测系统中实施深度估计提供了实用指导，Depth Anything V2在准确性和速度之间提供了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through
natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the
analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and
interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate

TL;DR: AA-YOLO通过在YOLO检测头中集成统计异常检测测试，将小目标视为背景中的异常模式，有效控制红外小目标检测中的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在国防应用中面临复杂背景和小目标尺寸的挑战，传统目标检测器会产生大量误报。

Method: 在YOLO检测头中集成统计异常检测测试，将小目标视为背景中的异常模式进行检测。

Result: 在多个IRSTD基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，在训练数据有限、噪声和域偏移场景下表现出显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AA-YOLO具有高度通用性，可应用于各种YOLO骨干网络，包括轻量级模型，是资源受限实际部署的有吸引力解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: Transformer架构在自然交互中的人员识别具有巨大潜力，姿态和动态信息具有互补性，为未来多模态和跨文化研究提供了见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of transformer-based architectures
for person identification in natural, face-to-face conversation scenario. We
implement and evaluate a two-stream framework that separately models spatial
configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints,
extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments
compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity
features, and introduce a multi-scale temporal transformer for hierarchical
motion modeling. Results demonstrate that domain-specific training
significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations
carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial
transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal
transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%,
confirming that postural and dynamic information are complementary. These
findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for person
identification in natural interactions and provide insights for future
multimodal and cross-cultural studies.

TL;DR: PG-Occ是一个渐进式高斯变换器框架，用于开放词汇的3D占用预测，通过渐进在线致密化和各向异性感知采样策略，在稀疏和密集表示之间取得平衡，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本对齐场景建模中的权衡问题：稀疏高斯表示难以捕捉小物体，而密集表示计算开销大。

Method: 采用渐进在线致密化策略逐步增强3D高斯表示，结合各向异性感知采样和时空融合，自适应分配不同尺度和阶段的感受野。

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中实现了14.3%的mIoU相对提升，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PG-Occ框架有效解决了开放词汇3D占用预测中的表示权衡问题，通过渐进式方法实现了更精确和详细的场景理解。

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be
released upon publication on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的开放词汇学习方法，通过生成未见类数据来估计开放环境中的分布，包括类域数据生成管道和分布对齐算法，在11个数据集上表现优于基线方法达14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用已见类数据估计开放环境分布，但由于未见类的缺失导致估计误差无法识别。学习超越已见类对于边界估计误差至关重要。

Method: 提出类域数据生成管道（在层次语义树和域信息指导下生成未见类数据）和分布对齐算法（估计并最大化后验概率以增强泛化能力）。

Result: 在11个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法比基线方法性能提升高达14%。

Conclusion: 通过生成未见类数据可以有效估计开放环境分布，理论证明估计误差有上界，提出的方法在开放词汇学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

TL;DR: FedSurg挑战赛是首个评估联邦学习在手术视频分类中应用的基准测试，重点关注模型在未见临床中心的泛化能力和本地微调后的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估当前方法在手术视频分类中如何泛化到未见临床中心，以及通过本地微调实现适应，同时在不共享患者数据的情况下实现协作模型开发。

Method: 参与者使用多中心Appendix300视频数据集开发策略来分类阑尾炎炎症阶段。评估两个任务：未见中心的泛化和微调后的中心特定适应。提交方法包括基础模型线性探测、三元组损失的度量学习，以及各种FL聚合方案（FedAvg、FedMedian、FedSAM）。

Result: 在泛化任务中，跨中心性能有限；在适应任务中，所有团队在微调后都有改进，但排名稳定性较低。ViViT提交获得最强整体性能。挑战凸显了泛化限制、类别不平衡敏感性和去中心化训练中超参数调优困难。

Conclusion: FedSurg挑战赛建立了评估手术视频分类中FL策略的首个基准。发现强调了本地个性化与全局鲁棒性之间的权衡，以及架构选择、预处理和损失设计的重要性。为未来开发不平衡感知、自适应和鲁棒的临床手术AI FL方法提供了参考点。

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

Motivation: 传统3D扫描方法需要专业知识和手动干预来维持最佳扫描条件和覆盖范围，这限制了文化遗产数字化的效率和可访问性。

Method: 使用两个协调工作的机器人系统：一个配备扫描仪的机器人和一个托盘处理机器人。系统将扫描空间参数化为不同区域，通过优化的轨迹规划和路径点分布确保全面表面覆盖。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基线方法实现了显著更低的Chamfer Distance和更高的F-score，提供了优越的几何精度和数字化效率。

Conclusion: 该系统显著提高了文化遗产文物3D扫描的自动化水平，减少了对外部操作专家的依赖，同时保持了高精度的重建质量。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage
artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation.
However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and
manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We
present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for
handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic
manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the
scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning
between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized
trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface
coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system
efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly
lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods,
offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and
reduced reliance on expert operators.

Motivation: 研究ViT和CNN作为骨干网络在几何估计任务（如图像刚性变换和基础矩阵估计）中的效率，特别是在低数据环境下的表现。

Method: 系统比较大规模CNN（ResNet、EfficientNet、CLIP-ResNet）与ViT基础模型（CLIP-ViT变体和DINO）在不同数据规模设置下的性能，包括少样本场景。

Result: 在大数据下游场景中，ViT在微调时优于CNN；在小数据场景中，CNN的归纳偏置和较小容量使其性能与ViT相当；ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要根据任务需求仔细选择模型架构进行微调，未来研究应关注平衡局部和全局表示的混合架构。

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿模型在细节保留、鲁棒性、采样效率和泛化能力方面存在不足，需要更强大的解决方案。

Method: 采用扩散变换器架构，探索多种图像条件配置（上下文token拼接、通道拼接、ControlNet集成），并在扩展数据集上训练以增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiT-VTON不仅改进了虚拟试穿任务，还扩展为虚拟试全解决方案，支持多种图像编辑功能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On
(VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products
overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization
across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel
VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its
performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the
image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术观察方法依赖固定视角或回忆，无法记录影响临床决策的第一人称视觉视角，限制了手术安全、培训和流程优化的分析。

Method: 结合几何驱动神经渲染和基于扩散的视图增强技术，从壁挂固定摄像头视频重建任意时刻的任意第一人称视角。

Result: 在多站点手术案例和对照研究中，EgoSurg能够以高视觉质量和保真度重建个体特定的视觉场和任意视角。

Conclusion: EgoSurg将现有手术室摄像头基础设施转化为可导航的动态3D记录，为沉浸式手术数据科学奠定新基础，使手术实践可以从各个角度可视化、体验和分析。

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

Conclusion: 该框架为4D虚拟试穿建立了新基准，支持单视角监督下的动态服装交互，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

Result: 在SynthRAD2025挑战基准上验证，能准确重建全局解剖结构，但受限于训练分辨率，细部细节保留有限。

Conclusion: 未来将探索基于patch的训练和潜在空间流模型来提高分辨率和局部结构保真度。

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法使用随机截断策略，缺乏灵活性且效果不佳。观察到神经网络在不同训练阶段具有不同的学习动态，随机截断效果不理想。

Method: AT-BPTT框架包含三个关键组件：基于概率的阶段感知时间步选择机制、基于梯度变化的自适应窗口大小策略、以及用于减少计算开销的低秩Hessian近似。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K上的实验表明，AT-BPTT平均准确率提升6.16%，内循环优化加速3.9倍，内存成本节省63%。

Conclusion: AT-BPTT通过动态适应截断策略，有效解决了数据集蒸馏中的优化问题，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving
63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer
insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合早期退出和知识蒸馏的方法，通过引入基于熵的损失函数来优化学生早期退出模型的训练，在保持分类性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类中表现出色但计算成本高，不适用于实时和边缘应用。需要开发压缩技术来降低计算成本，同时动态架构可以在执行时调节压缩级别。

Method: 整合早期退出和知识蒸馏两种优化技术，使用更复杂的教师早期退出模型训练简化的学生早期退出模型，并引入新的基于熵的损失函数来处理教师分类错误的图像。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN图像分类数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在保持分类性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效优化了准确性和效率之间的权衡，为知识蒸馏在其他环境中的研究开辟了新视角。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant
reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification
performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental
results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which
further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other
contexts.

Conclusion: 深度学习模型因其在异常值存在时的稳定性能、评估小图像块的能力和快速预测，使光学显微镜研究受益于其泛化能力。

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems,
guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management.
Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a
thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS)
tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted
surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000}
of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a
standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements
in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Method: 在深度网络架构中集成层次特定的分类头，每个头专门处理不同粒度的类别；使用可训练的层次矩阵以自监督方式学习层次结构；引入层次共识机制确保不同层次间概率分布的一致性。

Conclusion: SAHC方法能够有效利用遥感图像分类任务中的层次结构，通过层次共识机制提高了分类性能，展现了良好的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了REN（区域专家网络），这是首个针对医学图像分类的解剖学指导的MoE框架，通过训练7个专门针对不同肺叶的专家网络，结合多模态门控机制，在间质性肺病分类中取得显著性能提升。


<details>

Motivation: 传统MoE系统缺乏医学影像所需的解剖学约束，而肺部的解剖结构和区域疾病异质性对病理模式有重要影响，需要专门针对医学影像的解剖学指导框架。

Method: 利用解剖学先验训练7个专门针对不同肺叶和双肺组合的专家网络；采用多模态门控机制动态整合放射组学生物标志物和深度学习特征（CNN、ViT、Mamba）来优化专家贡献权重。

Conclusion: REN展示了强大的泛化能力和临床可解释性，提供了一个可扩展的解剖学指导方法，可轻松扩展到其他结构化医学影像应用。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to
scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex
tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific
constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and
clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach
readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

Motivation: 解决传统无监督主动学习(UAL)方法性能不足的问题，这些方法依赖局部梯度评分，容易受噪声干扰且无法充分代表数据分布

Method: 使用特定特征学习机(SFLM)量化样本对模型性能的贡献度，并定义重构差异指标进行初始样本选择

Result: NFPF显著超越现有UAL方法，在视觉数据集上达到与监督主动学习方法相当的性能

Conclusion: NFPF通过革命性的样本重要性度量方法，在无监督主动学习中实现了优越性能、增强的鲁棒性和更好的数据分布覆盖

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Conclusion: CA3D-Diff框架成功解决了乳腺X线摄影视图转换中的结构对齐问题，在真实诊断场景中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

Motivation: 当前基于KL-VAE的tokenizer需要对抗性损失，而扩散解码器虽然更理论化但需要迭代采样导致解码时间较长。SSDD旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 引入新的像素扩散解码器架构，利用transformer组件和无GAN训练，通过蒸馏技术将扩散解码器性能复制到高效的单步解码器中。

Result: SSDD将重建FID从0.87提升到0.50，吞吐量提高1.4倍，在DiTs中保持生成质量的同时采样速度提高3.8倍。

Conclusion: SSDD可以作为KL-VAE的直接替代品，用于构建更高质量和更快的生成模型。

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

Result: LUR和RLUR在分布内分类性能与其他方法相当，在不确定性检测方面与最佳方法匹配，但训练更高效、调参更容易。

Conclusion: LUR方法在保持性能的同时提供了更高效的不确定性估计方案，特别适合资源受限环境中的安全关键应用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Motivation: 帕金森病早期诊断对预防不良影响至关重要，但传统诊断方法繁琐且昂贵，需要开发非侵入性、成本效益高的解决方案。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络、迁移学习和注意力机制，通过数据增强增加训练图像多样性，构建包含预训练CNN、自定义卷积层和集成投票的三阶段架构。

Conclusion: 机器学习在帕金森病早期诊断中具有巨大潜力，能够提供非侵入性且成本效益高的解决方案来改善患者预后。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are
90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions
through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings
underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a
non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

Conclusion: 利用3D基础模型的空间理解能力可以有效解决宽基线分割匹配问题，在极端视角变化下实现鲁棒的分割匹配

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种针对对比度失真图像的无参考图像质量评估方法，通过选择最合适的对比度增强算法生成伪参考图像，将NR-IQA问题转化为FR-IQA问题以提高评估精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比度变化是影响图像质量的重要因素，但在图像质量评估中常被忽视。现有方法主要关注模糊和噪声等失真，而对比度失真的视觉影响和特性与传统失真不同。

Method: 使用一组对比度增强算法生成视觉上接近真实参考图像的伪参考图像，训练分类网络根据图像内容和失真选择最合适的对比度增强算法，最终以全参考方式评估对比度增强图像与退化图像之间的质量差异。

Result: 在包含对比度失真的三个数据库（CCID2014、TID2013和CSIQ）上的性能评估表明，该方法具有有前景的性能。

Conclusion: 通过将无参考问题转化为全参考问题，该方法能够有效评估对比度失真图像的质量，在多个数据库上表现出良好性能。

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

Motivation: 现代视觉生成模型在创建美观的自然图像方面表现出色，但在生成或编辑需要组合规划、文本渲染和多模态推理的结构化视觉内容时存在困难。

Method: 构建了130万对高质量结构化图像数据集，训练了一个集成VLM和FLUX.1 Kontext的统一模型，采用三阶段训练课程，并在推理时使用外部推理器增强性能。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集、模型和基准测试，旨在推进结构化视觉内容的多模态基础研究。

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何生成不同世界角色（如Mr. Bean和Tom and Jerry）自然交互的视频，关键挑战是保持角色身份和行为逻辑的同时实现跨上下文连贯交互。

Method: 使用交叉角色嵌入（CCE）从多模态源学习身份和行为逻辑，结合交叉角色增强（CCA）通过合成共存和混合风格数据丰富训练。

Result: 在包含10个角色的卡通和真人剧集基准测试中，在身份保持、交互质量和风格协调鲁棒性方面取得明显改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现先前不共存角色之间的自然交互而不损失风格保真度，为生成式叙事开辟了新形式。

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在合成复杂动态和连贯因果链方面存在困难，而多模态模型具备强大的视觉状态推理能力，需要将两者优势结合。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型生成稀疏关键帧作为快照，然后基于这些关键帧对预训练视频生成器进行稀疏推理时微调。

Result: 在复杂多步骤场景上的实验表明，VChain显著提升了生成视频的质量。

Conclusion: VChain通过注入多模态模型的视觉推理信号，实现了调优高效、开销最小的视频生成质量提升。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

Motivation: 研究transformer语言模型中注意力模式分散的注意力头，这些头的注意力分数对内容依赖较弱，其softmax分母在固定token分布下是稳定的。

Method: 使用校准文本采样softmax分母，组合GPT2-Small第一层中多个稳定注意力头的输出，将其近似为周围文本的线性摘要。

Result: 仅从模型权重和单个校准文本就能发现数百个第一层神经元，这些神经元对周围文本的高级上下文属性敏感，包括在校准文本上未激活的神经元。

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅从权重和校准文本中揭示transformer第一层神经元对上下文属性的敏感性，为理解模型内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: We study transformer language models, analyzing attention heads whose
attention patterns are spread out, and whose attention scores depend weakly on
content. We argue that the softmax denominators of these heads are stable when
the underlying token distribution is fixed. By sampling softmax denominators
from a "calibration text", we can combine together the outputs of multiple such
stable heads in the first layer of GPT2-Small, approximating their combined
output by a linear summary of the surrounding text. This approximation enables
a procedure where from the weights alone - and a single calibration text - we
can uncover hundreds of first layer neurons that respond to high-level
contextual properties of the surrounding text, including neurons that didn't
activate on the calibration text.

Conclusion: Graph-S³框架有效解决了文本图问答中的图检索问题，通过合成监督训练实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: A significant portion of real-world data is inherently represented as textual
graphs, and integrating these graphs into large language models (LLMs) is
promising to enable complex graph-based question answering. However, a key
challenge in LLM-based textual graph QA systems lies in graph retrieval, i.e.,
how to retrieve relevant content from large graphs that is sufficiently
informative while remaining compact for the LLM context. Existing retrievers
suffer from poor performance since they either rely on shallow embedding
similarity or employ interactive retrieving policies that demand excessive data
labeling and training cost. To address these issues, we present Graph-$S^3$, an
agentic textual graph reasoning framework that employs an LLM-based retriever
trained with synthetic stepwise supervision. Instead of rewarding the agent
based on the final answers, which may lead to sparse and unstable training
signals, we propose to closely evaluate each step of the retriever based on
offline-extracted golden subgraphs. Our main techniques include a data
synthesis pipeline to extract the golden subgraphs for reward generation and a
two-stage training scheme to learn the interactive graph exploration policy
based on the synthesized rewards. Based on extensive experiments on three
common datasets in comparison with seven strong baselines, our approach
achieves an average improvement of 8.1\% in accuracy and 9.7\% in F$_1$ score.
The advantage is even higher in more complicated multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our
code will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: LLMs在完成日常任务时展现的价值观与人类存在显著差异，且不同模型之间也存在不一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can underpin AI assistants that help users with
everyday tasks, such as by making recommendations or performing basic
computation. Despite AI assistants' promise, little is known about the implicit
values these assistants display while completing subjective everyday tasks.
Humans may consider values like environmentalism, charity, and diversity. To
what extent do LLMs exhibit these values in completing everyday tasks? How do
they compare with humans? We answer these questions by auditing how six popular
LLMs complete 30 everyday tasks, comparing LLMs to each other and to 100 human
crowdworkers from the US. We find LLMs often do not align with humans, nor with
other LLMs, in the implicit values exhibited.

Abstract: We introduce CSAR, an algorithm for inducing morphemes from emergent language

weights morphemes based on mutual information between forms and meanings, (2)
selects the highest-weighted pair, (3) removes it from the corpus, and (4)
repeats the process to induce further morphemes (i.e., Count, Select, Ablate,
Repeat). The effectiveness of CSAR is first validated on procedurally generated
datasets and compared against baselines for related tasks. Second, we validate
CSAR's performance on human language data to show that the algorithm makes
reasonable predictions in adjacent domains. Finally, we analyze a handful of
emergent languages, quantifying linguistic characteristics like degree of
synonymy and polysemy.

Conclusion: Omni-Embed-Nemotron能够处理现实世界信息需求的复杂性，为多模态检索提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: We present Omni-Embed-Nemotron, a unified multimodal retrieval embedding
model developed to handle the increasing complexity of real-world information
needs. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced
language models by incorporating external knowledge, existing text-based
retrievers rely on clean, structured input and struggle with the visually and
semantically rich content found in real-world documents such as PDFs, slides,
or videos. Recent work such as ColPali has shown that preserving document
layout using image-based representations can improve retrieval quality.
Building on this, and inspired by the capabilities of recent multimodal models
such as Qwen2.5-Omni, we extend retrieval beyond text and images to also
support audio and video modalities. Omni-Embed-Nemotron enables both
cross-modal (e.g., text - video) and joint-modal (e.g., text - video+audio)
retrieval using a single model. We describe the architecture, training setup,
and evaluation results of Omni-Embed-Nemotron, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in text, image, and video retrieval.

using XferBench as the objective function. XferBench quantifies the statistical
similarity of emergent language to human language by measuring its suitability
for deep transfer learning to human language. Additionally, we demonstrate the
predictive power of entropy on the transfer learning performance of emergent
language as well as corroborate previous results on the entropy-minimization
properties of emergent communication systems. Finally, we report
generalizations regarding what hyperparameters produce more realistic emergent
languages, that is, ones which transfer better to human language.

### [177] [SEER: The Span-based Emotion Evidence Retrieval Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03490)
*Aneesha Sampath,Oya Aran,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER基准测试评估大语言模型在识别文本中表达情感的具体片段的能力，包含单句和跨句情感证据检测任务，发现模型在长文本中表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别任务仅给整个句子分配单一标签，而实际应用需要知道情感是如何表达的，因此需要开发能够精确定位情感表达片段的方法。

Method: 创建SEER基准测试，包含1200个真实世界句子的新标注，评估14个开源大语言模型在单句和跨句情感证据检测任务中的表现。

Result: 部分模型在单句输入上接近人类平均表现，但在较长段落中准确性下降。错误分析显示主要失败模式包括过度依赖情感关键词和在中性文本中出现误报。

Conclusion: SEER基准测试突显了当前大语言模型在细粒度情感证据检测方面的局限性，特别是在处理较长文本时，需要改进模型对情感表达的理解能力。

Abstract: We introduce the SEER (Span-based Emotion Evidence Retrieval) Benchmark to
test Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to identify the specific spans of
text that express emotion. Unlike traditional emotion recognition tasks that
assign a single label to an entire sentence, SEER targets the underexplored
task of emotion evidence detection: pinpointing which exact phrases convey
emotion. This span-level approach is crucial for applications like empathetic
dialogue and clinical support, which need to know how emotion is expressed, not
just what the emotion is. SEER includes two tasks: identifying emotion evidence
within a single sentence, and identifying evidence across a short passage of
five consecutive sentences. It contains new annotations for both emotion and
emotion evidence on 1200 real-world sentences. We evaluate 14 open-source LLMs
and find that, while some models approach average human performance on
single-sentence inputs, their accuracy degrades in longer passages. Our error
analysis reveals key failure modes, including overreliance on emotion keywords
and false positives in neutral text.

### [178] [ALHD: A Large-Scale and Multigenre Benchmark Dataset for Arabic LLM-Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03502)
*Ali Khairallah,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALHD是首个大规模阿拉伯语数据集，专门用于区分人类和LLM生成的文本，涵盖新闻、社交媒体和评论三种文体，包含超过40万个平衡样本，支持阿拉伯语LLM文本检测的泛化性研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立专门针对阿拉伯语的LLM生成文本检测数据集，以应对错误信息、学术不端和网络威胁等风险，填补阿拉伯语在该研究领域的空白。

Method: 构建包含三种文体（新闻、社交媒体、评论）的大规模平衡数据集，覆盖现代标准阿拉伯语和方言阿拉伯语，使用三种领先LLM生成样本，并提供严格预处理、丰富标注和标准化分割。

Result: 微调的BERT模型在检测性能上表现最佳，优于基于LLM的模型，但在跨文体泛化方面存在挑战，特别是在新闻文章中，LLM生成的文本在风格上更接近人类文本。

Conclusion: ALHD为阿拉伯语LLM检测研究奠定了基础，揭示了跨文体泛化的挑战，并指出了未来研究方向，特别是在处理新闻类文本时的检测困难。

Abstract: We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset
explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD
spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and
dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three
leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying
generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous
preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support
reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark
experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing
future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers,
BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that
fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based
models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges
when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when
they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these
challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where
LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for
future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic
LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and
cyber threats.

### [179] [TS-Reasoner: Aligning Time Series Foundation Models with LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03519)
*Fangxu Yu,Hongyu Zhao,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TS-Reasoner通过将时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的潜在表示与大型语言模型(LLMs)的文本输入对齐，解决了时间序列推理任务中数值理解与语义推理的融合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型能捕捉动态模式但缺乏推理能力，而大型语言模型具备推理能力但难以理解数值时间序列数据。需要有效整合两种模型以实现时间序列推理。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法：首先使用合成的时序-文本对进行对齐预训练，然后进行指令微调。冻结预训练的TSFM，只训练对齐模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TS-Reasoner优于主流LLMs、VLMs和时间序列LLMs，且具有显著的数据效率（使用不到一半的训练数据）。

Conclusion: TS-Reasoner成功实现了时间序列与文本模态的有效对齐，为时间序列推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series reasoning is crucial to decision-making in diverse domains,
including finance, energy usage, traffic, weather, and scientific discovery.
While existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) can capture low-level
dynamic patterns and provide accurate forecasting, further analysis usually
requires additional background knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, which are
lacking in most TSFMs but can be achieved through large language models (LLMs).
On the other hand, without expensive post-training, LLMs often struggle with
the numerical understanding of time series data. Although it is intuitive to
integrate the two types of models, developing effective training recipes that
align the two modalities for reasoning tasks is still an open challenge. To
this end, we propose TS-Reasoner that aligns the latent representations of
TSFMs with the textual inputs of LLMs for downstream understanding/reasoning
tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to curate
diverse, synthetic pairs of time series and textual captions for alignment
training. We then develop a two-stage training recipe that applies instruction
finetuning after the alignment pretraining. Unlike existing works that train an
LLM to take time series as inputs, we leverage a pretrained TSFM and freeze it
during training. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that
TS-Reasoner not only outperforms a wide range of prevailing LLMs, Vision
Language Models (VLMs), and Time Series LLMs, but also achieves this with
remarkable data efficiency, e.g., using less than half the training data.

*Ali Elahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在专业领域推理中，传统RAG方法存在局限性，无法检索可比案例或相关问题，导致输出内容过于通用。本文提出在RAG之上增加同行感知比较推理层，通过对比方法提升专业推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在专业领域（如金融）中，人类通常通过比较类似案例、突出细微差别来推理，而传统RAG只能提取事实信息，无法检索可比案例，导致输出内容过于通用，缺乏针对性的洞察。

Method: 在RAG基础上增加同行感知比较推理层，采用对比方法，通过检索和比较相关案例来增强专业推理能力。

Result: 对比方法在文本生成指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）上优于基线RAG，与人工生成的股权研究和风险评估相比表现更好。

Conclusion: 在RAG之上增加对比推理层能有效提升专业领域推理的质量和针对性，解决传统RAG输出过于通用的问题。

Abstract: In specialized domains, humans often compare new problems against similar
examples, highlight nuances, and draw conclusions instead of analyzing
information in isolation. When applying reasoning in specialized contexts with
LLMs on top of a RAG, the pipeline can capture contextually relevant
information, but it is not designed to retrieve comparable cases or related
problems.
  While RAG is effective at extracting factual information, its outputs in
specialized reasoning tasks often remain generic, reflecting broad facts rather
than context-specific insights. In finance, it results in generic risks that
are true for the majority of companies. To address this limitation, we propose
a peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG.
  Our contrastive approach outperforms baseline RAG in text generation metrics
such as ROUGE and BERTScore in comparison with human-generated equity research
and risk.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Consensus Graphs (ConGrs)数据结构，通过整合多个语言模型响应的共享信息和语义变化，生成更准确、更可靠的最终响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效整合多个长文本响应中的丰富认知信号，需要一种能捕捉语言模型响应变化并利用这些认知信号的方法。

Method: 使用基于生物信息学的轻量级词汇序列对齐算法构建ConGrs，辅以次级语言模型判断，并设计任务相关的解码方法从ConGr合成最终响应。

Result: 在传记生成任务中事实准确性提升31%；在拒绝任务中弃权率提高56%；在数学推理任务中准确率提升6个百分点；减少对语言模型判断的依赖超过80%。

Conclusion: ConGrs提供了一种灵活的方法来捕捉语言模型响应变化，并利用响应变化提供的认知信号来合成更有效的响应。

Abstract: Language models can be sampled multiple times to access the distribution
underlying their responses, but existing methods cannot efficiently synthesize
rich epistemic signals across different long-form responses. We introduce
Consensus Graphs (ConGrs), a flexible DAG-based data structure that represents
shared information, as well as semantic variation in a set of sampled LM
responses to the same prompt. We construct ConGrs using a light-weight lexical
sequence alignment algorithm from bioinformatics, supplemented by the targeted
usage of a secondary LM judge. Further, we design task-dependent decoding
methods to synthesize a single, final response from our ConGr data structure.
Our experiments show that synthesizing responses from ConGrs improves factual
precision on two biography generation tasks by up to 31% over an average
response and reduces reliance on LM judges by more than 80% compared to other
methods. We also use ConGrs for three refusal-based tasks requiring abstention
on unanswerable queries and find that abstention rate is increased by up to
56%. We apply our approach to the MATH and AIME reasoning tasks and find an
improvement over self-verification and majority vote baselines by up to 6
points of accuracy. We show that ConGrs provide a flexible method for capturing
variation in LM responses and using the epistemic signals provided by response
variation to synthesize more effective responses.

TL;DR: 研究探索在指令微调数据中引入扰动是否能增强大语言模型对噪声指令的抵抗能力，发现某些情况下扰动指令微调能提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明大语言模型对指令表述的微小变化很敏感，这影响了它们在真实场景中的实用性。

Method: 在指令微调数据中引入扰动（如删除停用词、打乱词序），评估模型在原始和扰动版本基准测试（MMLU、BBH、GSM8K）上的表现。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，在某些情况下，对扰动指令进行微调反而能提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 在指令微调中包含扰动指令很重要，这能让大语言模型对噪声用户输入更具韧性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning plays a vital role in enhancing the task-solving abilities
of large language models (LLMs), improving their usability in generating
helpful responses on various tasks. However, previous work has demonstrated
that they are sensitive to minor variations in instruction phrasing. In this
paper, we explore whether introducing perturbations in instruction-tuning data
can enhance LLMs' resistance against noisy instructions. We focus on how
instruction-tuning with perturbations, such as removing stop words or shuffling
words, affects LLMs' performance on the original and perturbed versions of
widely-used benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GSM8K). We further assess learning dynamics
and potential shifts in model behavior. Surprisingly, our results suggest that
instruction-tuning on perturbed instructions can, in some cases, improve
downstream performance. These findings highlight the importance of including
perturbed instructions in instruction-tuning, which can make LLMs more
resilient to noisy user inputs.

*Zhaohan Meng,Zaiqiao Meng,Siwei Liu,Iadh Ounis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriMediQ是一个基于三元组结构的方法，通过将患者响应总结为三元组并构建知识图谱，提升LLM在多轮医疗对话中的临床推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在静态医疗问答中表现良好，但在实际临床咨询的多轮交互式信息收集中可靠性显著下降，因为临床事实在对话日志中缺乏明确关联。

Method: 使用冻结的三元组生成器提取临床相关三元组，通过训练投影模块（图编码器和投影器）从知识图谱中捕获关系信息，采用两阶段方法：先微调投影模块（LLM权重冻结），然后在推理时使用微调模块指导多跳推理。

Result: 在两个交互式QA基准测试中，TriMediQ在iMedQA数据集上比五个基线模型准确率提升高达10.4%。

Conclusion: 将患者响应转换为基于三元组的结构化图谱能够在多轮设置中实现更准确的临床推理，为基于LLM的医疗助手部署提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform strongly in static and single-turn
medical Question Answer (QA) benchmarks, yet such settings diverge from the
iterative information gathering process required in practical clinical
consultations. The MEDIQ framework addresses this mismatch by recasting the
diagnosis as an interactive dialogue between a patient and an expert system,
but the reliability of LLMs drops dramatically when forced to reason with
dialogue logs, where clinical facts appear in sentences without clear links. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that
summarises patient responses into triplets and integrates them into a Knowledge
Graph (KG), enabling multi-hop reasoning. We introduce a frozen triplet
generator that extracts clinically relevant triplets, using prompts designed to
ensure factual consistency. In parallel, a trainable projection module,
comprising a graph encoder and a projector, captures relational information
from the KG to enhance expert reasoning. TriMediQ operates in two steps: (i)
the projection module fine-tuning with all LLM weights frozen; and (ii) using
the fine-tuned module to guide multi-hop reasoning during inference. We
evaluate TriMediQ on two interactive QA benchmarks, showing that it achieves up
to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five baselines on the iMedQA dataset.
These results demonstrate that converting patient responses into structured
triplet-based graphs enables more accurate clinical reasoning in multi-turn
settings, providing a solution for the deployment of LLM-based medical
assistants.

TL;DR: 论文指出在计算社会科学中使用大语言模型进行文本分类时，概念化步骤容易被忽视，这会导致概念化误差并影响下游统计推断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算社会科学中广泛使用生成式大语言模型进行文本分类，但研究者往往忽视了分类前的概念化步骤和分类后的统计推断问题，这可能导致系统性偏差。

Method: 通过模拟实验分析概念化误差对下游估计的影响，并测试仅提高LLM准确性或使用后处理偏差校正方法是否能纠正这种偏差。

Result: 研究发现概念化引起的偏差无法仅通过提高LLM准确性或后处理偏差校正方法来纠正，这种偏差会持续影响下游估计。

Conclusion: 在LLM时代，概念化仍然是计算社会科学中的首要关注点，论文提供了实现低成本、无偏、低方差下游估计的具体建议。

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) are now used extensively for text
classification in computational social science (CSS). In this work, focus on
the steps before and after LLM prompting -- conceptualization of concepts to be
classified and using LLM predictions in downstream statistical inference --
which we argue have been overlooked in much of LLM-era CSS. We claim LLMs can
tempt analysts to skip the conceptualization step, creating conceptualization
errors that bias downstream estimates. Using simulations, we show that this
conceptualization-induced bias cannot be corrected for solely by increasing LLM
accuracy or post-hoc bias correction methods. We conclude by reminding CSS
analysts that conceptualization is still a first-order concern in the LLM-era
and provide concrete advice on how to pursue low-cost, unbiased, low-variance
downstream estimates.

*Hasibur Rahman,Hanan Salam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCD-Bench是一个评估LLM在跨文化价值冲突中决策能力的基准，包含2,182个跨七个领域的开放式困境，发现模型偏好北欧和日耳曼欧洲文化，而忽视东欧和中东文化，显示当前对齐策略存在文化偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注文化知识、价值预测或单轴偏见诊断，缺乏评估LLM在多个文化价值系统直接冲突时的裁决能力，因此需要开发专门评估跨文化价值冲突决策的基准。

Method: 构建包含2,182个开放式困境的CCD-Bench基准，涵盖七个领域，每个困境对应十个GLOBE文化集群的匿名响应选项，使用分层拉丁方设计来减轻顺序效应，评估17个非推理LLM。

Result: 模型明显偏好北欧欧洲(20.2%)和日耳曼欧洲(12.4%)，而东欧和中东北非选项代表性不足(5.6-5.8%)；87.9%的理据引用多个GLOBE维度但只是表面多元主义；顺序效应可忽略，模型按开发者谱系而非地理位置聚类。

Conclusion: 当前对齐流程促进共识导向世界观，无法充分处理需要权力协商、权利推理或性别意识分析的场景，需要开发能实质性参与多元世界观的更平衡对齐策略。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly implicated in
interpersonal and societal decision-making, their ability to navigate explicit
conflicts between legitimately different cultural value systems remains largely
unexamined. Existing benchmarks predominantly target cultural knowledge
(CulturalBench), value prediction (WorldValuesBench), or single-axis bias
diagnostics (CDEval); none evaluate how LLMs adjudicate when multiple
culturally grounded values directly clash. We address this gap with CCD-Bench,
a benchmark that assesses LLM decision-making under cross-cultural value
conflict. CCD-Bench comprises 2,182 open-ended dilemmas spanning seven domains,
each paired with ten anonymized response options corresponding to the ten GLOBE
cultural clusters. These dilemmas are presented using a stratified Latin square
to mitigate ordering effects. We evaluate 17 non-reasoning LLMs. Models
disproportionately prefer Nordic Europe (mean 20.2 percent) and Germanic Europe
(12.4 percent), while options for Eastern Europe and the Middle East and North
Africa are underrepresented (5.6 to 5.8 percent). Although 87.9 percent of
rationales reference multiple GLOBE dimensions, this pluralism is superficial:
models recombine Future Orientation and Performance Orientation, and rarely
ground choices in Assertiveness or Gender Egalitarianism (both under 3
percent). Ordering effects are negligible (Cramer's V less than 0.10), and
symmetrized KL divergence shows clustering by developer lineage rather than
geography. These patterns suggest that current alignment pipelines promote a
consensus-oriented worldview that underserves scenarios demanding power
negotiation, rights-based reasoning, or gender-aware analysis. CCD-Bench shifts
evaluation beyond isolated bias detection toward pluralistic decision making
and highlights the need for alignment strategies that substantively engage
diverse worldviews.

TL;DR: RxT是一种新型Transformer架构，通过事件驱动范式解决传统Transformer在对话AI中的状态缺失和二次计算复杂度问题，实现线性扩展的实时长对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在对话应用中存在状态缺失和二次计算复杂度问题，导致长对话成本高昂、延迟严重。

Method: RxT采用事件驱动架构，将对话轮次作为离散事件处理，集成固定大小的短期记忆系统，通过生成器-解码器产生响应，异步更新记忆。

Result: 实验验证显示RxT在合成数据上表现优异，推理延迟恒定，相比基线模型实现线性扩展。

Conclusion: RxT通过解耦响应生成和记忆更新，实现了低延迟、状态保持且经济可行的长对话系统。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large
Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is
fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic
computational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$.
Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation
history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long
dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel
architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a
data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn
as a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,
fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct
operational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the
current query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a
dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a
representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters
the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation
from quadratic ($O(N^2 \cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \cdot T)$) with respect to
the number of interactions $N$. By decoupling response generation from memory
updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and
economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with
a series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating
superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to a baseline
stateless model of comparable size.

Motivation: 解决法语生物医学文本中命名实体识别和事件抽取的低资源场景问题，探索大语言模型在少样本设置下的应用潜力。

Method: 提出三种NER方法：(1) GPT-4.1的上下文学习，自动选择10个示例并整合标注指南；(2) GLiNER系统在合成语料上微调后经LLM后处理验证；(3) LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct在合成语料上微调。事件抽取采用与NER相同的上下文学习策略。

Result: GPT-4.1在NER任务上获得61.53%的宏F1分数，在事件抽取任务上获得15.02%的宏F1分数，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 在极低资源场景下，精心设计的提示工程对于最大化大语言模型性能至关重要，GPT-4.1在少样本设置下展现出优越性能。

Abstract: This work presents our participation in the EvalLLM 2025 challenge on
biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and health event extraction in French
(few-shot setting). For NER, we propose three approaches combining large
language models (LLMs), annotation guidelines, synthetic data, and
post-processing: (1) in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-4.1, incorporating
automatic selection of 10 examples and a summary of the annotation guidelines
into the prompt, (2) the universal NER system GLiNER, fine-tuned on a synthetic
corpus and then verified by an LLM in post-processing, and (3) the open LLM
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, fine-tuned on the same synthetic corpus. Event
extraction uses the same ICL strategy with GPT-4.1, reusing the guideline
summary in the prompt. Results show GPT-4.1 leads with a macro-F1 of 61.53% for
NER and 15.02% for event extraction, highlighting the importance of
well-crafted prompting to maximize performance in very low-resource scenarios.

TL;DR: Deco-G是一个解码框架，通过将格式遵循与任务解决解耦，使用独立概率模型处理格式要求，让LLM专注于任务指令，从而提升复杂提示下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着提示变得越来越复杂，LLM难以同时遵循所有指令，特别是当推理指令与严格格式要求交织在一起时，这种纠缠会为模型创造相互竞争的目标。

Method: Deco-G使用独立可处理的概率模型(TPM)处理格式遵循，同时仅向LLM提供任务指令。在每个解码步骤中，将LLM的下一个标记概率与TPM计算的格式遵循似然相结合。

Result: 在数学推理、LLM-as-a-judge和事件参数提取等多样化格式要求的任务中，Deco-G相比常规提示方法获得了1.0%到6.0%的相对性能提升，且保证格式合规。

Conclusion: 明确分离格式遵循和任务解决可以显著提升LLM在复杂提示下的性能，Deco-G框架为此提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adept at following instructions
containing task descriptions to solve complex problems, such as mathematical
reasoning and automatic evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge). However, as prompts grow
more complex, models often struggle to adhere to all instructions. This
difficulty is especially common when instructive prompts intertwine reasoning
directives -- specifying what the model should solve -- with rigid formatting
requirements that dictate how the solution must be presented. The entanglement
creates competing goals for the model, suggesting that more explicit separation
of these two aspects could lead to improved performance. To this front, we
introduce Deco-G, a decoding framework that explicitly decouples format
adherence from task solving. Deco-G handles format compliance with a separate
tractable probabilistic model (TPM), while prompts LLMs with only task
instructions. At each decoding step, Deco-G combines next token probabilities
from the LLM with the TPM calculated format compliance likelihood to form the
output probability. To make this approach both practical and scalable for
modern instruction-tuned LLMs, we introduce three key innovations:
instruction-aware distillation, a flexible trie-building algorithm, and HMM
state pruning for computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
Deco-G across a wide range of tasks with diverse format requirements, including
mathematical reasoning, LLM-as-a-judge, and event argument extraction. Overall,
our approach yields 1.0% to 6.0% relative gain over regular prompting practice
with guaranteed format compliance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出新的评估方法，通过复杂的关系推理任务而非简单的检索任务来测试LLMs的有效上下文长度和遗忘倾向，发现模型在关系推理中比现有基准显示更早出现记忆漂移和上下文遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要依赖简单的'大海捞针'检索任务，无法准确反映LLMs在信息密集场景中的表现，需要更复杂的推理任务来评估模型从文本中提取结构化关系知识的能力。

Method: 设计复杂的关系推理任务，要求模型从可能包含噪声的自然语言内容中归纳出图结构知识，连接必须从分布在长上下文中的文本线索中推导，并夹杂无关信息。

Result: LLMs在这种关系推理任务中比现有基准建议的更短有效长度就开始表现出记忆漂移和上下文遗忘，即使是专门用于推理的模型如OpenAI o1也容易受到早期记忆漂移的影响。

Conclusion: 模型从非结构化输入中抽象结构化知识的能力存在显著局限性，需要架构改进来提升长距离推理能力，并为复杂推理任务中LLMs的最佳使用提供建议。

Abstract: Recently proposed evaluation benchmarks aim to characterize the effective
context length and the forgetting tendencies of large language models (LLMs).
However, these benchmarks often rely on simplistic 'needle in a haystack'
retrieval or continuation tasks that may not accurately reflect the performance
of these models in information-dense scenarios. Thus, rather than simple next
token prediction, we argue for evaluating these models on more complex
reasoning tasks that requires them to induce structured relational knowledge
from the text - such as graphs from potentially noisy natural language content.
While the input text can be viewed as generated in terms of a graph, its
structure is not made explicit and connections must be induced from distributed
textual cues, separated by long contexts and interspersed with irrelevant
information. Our findings reveal that LLMs begin to exhibit memory drift and
contextual forgetting at much shorter effective lengths when tasked with this
form of relational reasoning, compared to what existing benchmarks suggest.
With these findings, we offer recommendations for the optimal use of popular
LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We further show that even models specialized
for reasoning, such as OpenAI o1, remain vulnerable to early memory drift in
these settings. These results point to significant limitations in the models'
ability to abstract structured knowledge from unstructured input and highlight
the need for architectural adaptations to improve long-range reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于音节级别的无监督语音识别框架，通过掩码语言建模避免了G2P转换器的需求，在LibriSpeech上实现了40%相对字符错误率降低，并能有效泛化到中文等困难语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督语音识别中现有方法依赖G2P转换器、在音素边界模糊的语言中训练不稳定的问题，扩展ASR到低资源语言和从非平行数据中进行多模态学习。

Method: 基于掩码语言建模的音节级别无监督语音识别框架，避免了GAN方法的不稳定性，无需G2P转换器。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上实现高达40%的相对字符错误率降低，在中文等先前方法难以处理的语言上有效泛化。

Conclusion: 提出的音节级别UASR框架在性能和泛化能力上显著优于现有方法，为低资源语言语音识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training speech recognizers with unpaired speech and text -- known as
unsupervised speech recognition (UASR) -- is a crucial step toward extending
ASR to low-resource languages in the long-tail distribution and enabling
multimodal learning from non-parallel data. However, existing approaches based
on phones often rely on costly resources such as grapheme-to-phoneme converters
(G2Ps) and struggle to generalize to languages with ambiguous phoneme
boundaries due to training instability. In this paper, we address both
challenges by introducing a syllable-level UASR framework based on masked
language modeling, which avoids the need for G2P and the instability of
GAN-based methods. Our approach achieves up to a 40\% relative reduction in
character error rate (CER) on LibriSpeech and generalizes effectively to
Mandarin, a language that has remained particularly difficult for prior
methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

*Xiangyu Peng,Cab Qin,Zeyuan Chen,Ran Xu,Caiming Xiong,Chien-Sheng Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniDoc-Bench是首个大规模、真实的MM-RAG基准测试，基于70k真实PDF页面构建，包含1,600个多模态QA对，支持四种范式的公平比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MM-RAG评估存在碎片化问题，要么单独关注文本或图像，要么使用简化的多模态设置，无法捕捉文档中心的多模态用例。

Method: 从8个领域的70k真实PDF页面中提取并链接文本、表格和图像证据，生成1,600个多模态QA对，涵盖事实检索、比较、摘要和逻辑推理查询，20%经过多标注者验证和专家裁决。

Result: 实验表明多模态文本-图像融合RAG系统始终优于单模态和联合多模态嵌入检索，表明单独文本或图像都不足够，当前多模态嵌入仍不足够。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了视觉上下文何时以及如何补充文本证据，发现了系统性失败模式，并为开发更稳健的MM-RAG管道提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for
applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases,
yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in
isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture
document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce
UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from
70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links
evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA
pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical
reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by
multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports
apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)
image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint
retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,
prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal
text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly
multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images
alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.
Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context
complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers
actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

*Nisar Hussain,Amna Qasim,Gull Mehak,Muhammad Zain,Momina Hafeez,Grigori Sidorov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于QLoRA的微调框架，用于改进罗马乌尔都语-英语混合文本中的冒犯性语言检测，通过翻译处理低资源输入，Meta LLaMA 3 8B模型获得最高91.45的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罗马乌尔都语等代码混合语言中的贬义词汇使用给NLP系统带来挑战，包括未明确的语法、不一致的拼写和标记数据稀缺。

Method: 使用Google Translate将罗马乌尔都语-英语混合数据集翻译成英语以利用英语LLM，采用QLoRA对多个Transformer和大型语言模型进行内存高效的微调。

Result: Meta LLaMA 3 8B模型获得最高F1分数91.45，Mistral 7B为89.66，均超过传统Transformer基线模型。

Conclusion: QLoRA在微调高性能模型用于低资源环境（如代码混合冒犯性语言检测）方面具有有效性，证实了LLM在此任务中的潜力，为基于LLM的多语言冒犯检测系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: The use of derogatory terms in languages that employ code mixing, such as
Roman Urdu, presents challenges for Natural Language Processing systems due to
unstated grammar, inconsistent spelling, and a scarcity of labeled data. In
this work, we propose a QLoRA based fine tuning framework to improve offensive
language detection in Roman Urdu-English text. We translated the Roman
Urdu-English code mixed dataset into English using Google Translate to leverage
English LLMs, while acknowledging that this translation reduces direct
engagement with code mixing features. Our focus is on classification
performance using English translated low resource inputs. We fine tuned several
transformers and large language models, including Meta LLaMA 3 8B, Mistral 7B
v0.1, LLaMA 2 7B, ModernBERT, and RoBERTa, with QLoRA for memory efficient
adaptation. Models were trained and evaluated on a manually annotated Roman
Urdu dataset for offensive vs non offensive content. Of all tested models, the
highest F1 score of 91.45 was attained by Meta LLaMA 3 8B, followed by Mistral
7B at 89.66, surpassing traditional transformer baselines. These results
demonstrate the efficacy of QLoRA in fine tuning high performing models for low
resource environments such as code mixed offensive language detection, and
confirm the potential of LLMs for this task. This work advances a scalable
approach to Roman Urdu moderation and paves the way for future multilingual
offensive detection systems based on LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MedReflect框架，通过模拟医生的反思思维模式，让LLM在医学问题解决中进行自我验证和自我反思，无需外部检索或大量标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部知识检索或大量标注数据，存在检索开销大、标注成本高的问题，且在医学领域性能有限。

Method: MedReflect生成单次反思链，包括初始假设生成、自我提问、自我回答和决策优化，实现自我验证和反思。

Result: 仅用2000个随机训练样本和轻量微调，就在多个医学基准上取得显著准确率提升，大幅减少标注需求。

Conclusion: LLM可以通过自我反思和自我改进学习解决专业医学问题，减少对外部监督和大量任务特定微调数据的依赖。

Abstract: Medical problem solving demands expert knowledge and intricate reasoning.
Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) attempt to ease this complexity
by introducing external knowledge verification through retrieval-augmented
generation or by training on reasoning datasets. However, these approaches
suffer from drawbacks such as retrieval overhead and high annotation costs, and
they heavily rely on substituted external assistants to reach limited
performance in medical field. In this paper, we introduce MedReflect, a
generalizable framework designed to inspire LLMs with a physician-like
reflective thinking mode. MedReflect generates a single-pass reflection chain
that includes initial hypothesis generation, self-questioning, self-answering
and decision refinement. This self-verified and self-reflective nature releases
large language model's latent capability in medical problem-solving without
external retrieval or heavy annotation. We demonstrate that MedReflect enables
cost-efficient medical dataset construction: with merely 2,000 randomly sampled
training examples and a light fine-tuning, this approach achieves notable
absolute accuracy improvements across a series of medical benchmarks while
cutting annotation requirements. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can
learn to solve specialized medical problems via self-reflection and
self-improve, reducing reliance on external supervision and extensive
task-specific fine-tuning data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TreePrompt是一种新的示例选择方法，通过树状结构学习LLM偏好来识别高质量、上下文相关的翻译示例，并与K-NN和AFSP方法结合提升机器翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有few-shot提示方法主要关注查询与示例的相似性，但忽略了示例质量的重要性，这限制了翻译质量的进一步提升。

Method: 提出TreePrompt方法，在树状框架中学习LLM偏好来选择高质量示例，并与K-NN和AFSP方法结合探索相似性与质量的平衡。

Result: 在英语-波斯语和英语-德语翻译任务上的评估表明，TreePrompt与AFSP或随机选择结合能显著提升翻译性能。

Conclusion: TreePrompt通过考虑示例质量和上下文相关性，有效改进了few-shot提示在机器翻译中的应用，为LLM翻译性能优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have consistently demonstrated strong
performance in machine translation, especially when guided by high-quality
prompts. Few-shot prompting is an effective technique to improve translation
quality; however, most existing example selection methods focus solely on
query-to-example similarity and do not account for the quality of the examples.
In this work, we propose TreePrompt, a novel example selection approach that
learns LLM preferences to identify high-quality, contextually relevant examples
within a tree-structured framework. To further explore the balance between
similarity and quality, we combine TreePrompt with K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
and Adaptive Few-Shot Prompting (AFSP). Evaluations on two language pairs -
English-Persian (MIZAN) and English-German (WMT19) - show that integrating
TreePrompt with AFSP or Random selection leads to improved translation
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音细粒度分析的帕金森病检测方法，通过分析音素、音节和单词级别特征，在多种语言数据集上实现了高精度检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帕金森病语音检测系统分析整个语句，可能忽略了特定语音元素的诊断价值。帕金森病影响全球超1000万人，89%患者存在语音障碍。

Method: 开发了自动化流程提取时间对齐的音素、音节和单词特征，使用双向LSTM和多头注意力机制，在意大利语、西班牙语和英语数据集上比较不同粒度级别的诊断性能。

Result: 音素级分析表现最佳，AUROC达93.78%±2.34%，准确率达92.17%±2.43%。注意力分析显示最有效的语音特征与临床协议一致：持续元音、交替运动音节和特定单词序列。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了跨语言帕金森病检测的诊断能力，证明了语音细粒度分析在临床诊断中的价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people worldwide, with
speech impairments in up to 89% of patients. Current speech-based detection
systems analyze entire utterances, potentially overlooking the diagnostic value
of specific phonetic elements. We developed a granularity-aware approach for
multilingual PD detection using an automated pipeline that extracts
time-aligned phonemes, syllables, and words from recordings. Using Italian,
Spanish, and English datasets, we implemented a bidirectional LSTM with
multi-head attention to compare diagnostic performance across the different
granularity levels. Phoneme-level analysis achieved superior performance with
AUROC of 93.78% +- 2.34% and accuracy of 92.17% +- 2.43%. This demonstrates
enhanced diagnostic capability for cross-linguistic PD detection. Importantly,
attention analysis revealed that the most informative speech features align
with those used in established clinical protocols: sustained vowels (/a/, /e/,
/o/, /i/) at phoneme level, diadochokinetic syllables (/ta/, /pa/, /la/, /ka/)
at syllable level, and /pataka/ sequences at word level. Source code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的进步重塑了自然语言处理领域，少样本提示因其实用性和有效性受到关注。本研究旨在探究少样本提示策略如何影响词义消歧任务，特别是样本分布不平衡带来的偏差问题。

Method: 使用GLOSSGPT提示方法，在英语、德语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语五种语言上测试。评估了GPT-4o和LLaMA-3.1-70B模型，分析不平衡少样本示例对词义预测的影响。

Result: 结果显示，不平衡的少样本示例会导致多语言词义消歧的错误预测，但英语不受此问题影响。模型评估表明多语言WSD对少样本设置中的样本分布非常敏感。

Conclusion: 多语言词义消歧对少样本设置中的样本分布高度敏感，强调需要平衡和代表性的提示策略来确保模型性能的稳定性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped
the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Among the various prompting
techniques, few-shot prompting has gained considerable attention for its
practicality and effectiveness. This study investigates how few-shot prompting
strategies impact the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task, particularly
focusing on the biases introduced by imbalanced sample distributions. We use
the GLOSSGPT prompting method, an advanced approach for English WSD, to test
its effectiveness across five languages: English, German, Spanish, French, and
Italian. Our results show that imbalanced few-shot examples can cause incorrect
sense predictions in multilingual languages, but this issue does not appear in
English. To assess model behavior, we evaluate both the GPT-4o and
LLaMA-3.1-70B models and the results highlight the sensitivity of multilingual
WSD to sample distribution in few-shot settings, emphasizing the need for
balanced and representative prompting strategies.

TL;DR: 开发了Rezwan大型AI辅助圣训语料库，包含120万条圣训，通过全自动流水线提取和结构化，实现多语言翻译、智能标注、摘要生成等功能，在规模和质量上优于人工标注语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统圣训处理依赖人工专家，耗时耗力且难以大规模扩展。需要利用AI技术实现圣训文本的自动化处理和丰富标注，为数字人文和伊斯兰研究提供基础设施。

Method: 基于数字资源库，使用大型语言模型进行文本分割、传述链-文本分离、验证和多层增强，包括机器翻译、智能标注、摘要生成、主题标记和跨文本语义分析。

Result: 在1,213条随机样本的专家评估中，结构化任务接近人类准确度（传述链-文本分离9.33/10，摘要9.33/10），总体评分8.46/10显著优于人工语料库的3.66/10，且成本仅为传统方法的极小部分。

Conclusion: AI能够增强人类专业知识，为伊斯兰遗产提供大规模、多语言和语义丰富的访问方式，开创了宗教文本处理的新范式。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of Rezwan, a large-scale AI-assisted
Hadith corpus comprising over 1.2M narrations, extracted and structured through
a fully automated pipeline. Building on digital repositories such as Maktabat
Ahl al-Bayt, the pipeline employs Large Language Models (LLMs) for
segmentation, chain--text separation, validation, and multi-layer enrichment.
Each narration is enhanced with machine translation into twelve languages,
intelligent diacritization, abstractive summarization, thematic tagging, and
cross-text semantic analysis. This multi-step process transforms raw text into
a richly annotated research-ready infrastructure for digital humanities and
Islamic studies. A rigorous evaluation was conducted on 1,213 randomly sampled
narrations, assessed by six domain experts. Results show near-human accuracy in
structured tasks such as chain--text separation (9.33/10) and summarization
(9.33/10), while highlighting ongoing challenges in diacritization and semantic
similarity detection. Comparative analysis against the manually curated Noor
Corpus demonstrates the superiority of Najm in both scale and quality, with a
mean overall score of 8.46/10 versus 3.66/10. Furthermore, cost analysis
confirms the economic feasibility of the AI approach: tasks requiring over
229,000 hours of expert labor were completed within months at a fraction of the
cost. The work introduces a new paradigm in religious text processing by
showing how AI can augment human expertise, enabling large-scale, multilingual,
and semantically enriched access to Islamic heritage.

Abstract: This paper explores the ability of large language models to generate and
recognize deep cognitive frames, particularly in socio-political contexts. We
demonstrate that LLMs are highly fluent in generating texts that evoke specific
frames and can recognize these frames in zero-shot settings. Inspired by
mechanistic interpretability research, we investigate the location of the
`strict father' and `nurturing parent' frames within the model's hidden
representation, identifying singular dimensions that correlate strongly with
their presence. Our findings contribute to understanding how LLMs capture and
express meaningful human concepts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Step Pruner(SP)强化学习框架，通过惩罚冗余推理步骤来减少大型推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持准确性的同时显著降低响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通过强化学习惩罚生成token的方法存在两个问题：较少token不一定对应较少推理步骤；模型可能通过丢弃推理步骤来最小化token使用，产生hacking行为。

Method: 提出基于步骤感知的奖励函数，优先考虑正确性同时惩罚冗余步骤，对错误响应不给予奖励；引入动态停止机制，当输出步骤长度超过上限时停止更新以防止步骤合并导致的hacking行为。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试中，SP实现了最先进的准确性，同时显著减少响应长度。在AIME24上减少69.7%的token使用。

Conclusion: Step Pruner框架有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过步骤级别的优化实现了更高效的推理过程。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks
but often suffer from excessive verbosity, known as "overthinking." Existing
solutions via reinforcement learning (RL) typically penalize generated tokens
to promote conciseness. However, these methods encounter two challenges:
responses with fewer tokens do not always correspond to fewer reasoning steps,
and models may develop hacking behavior in later stages of training by
discarding reasoning steps to minimize token usage. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Step Pruner (SP)}, an RL framework that steers LRMs toward more
efficient reasoning by favoring compact reasoning steps. Our step-aware reward
function prioritizes correctness while imposing penalties for redundant steps,
and withholds rewards for incorrect responses to prevent the reinforcement of
erroneous reasoning. Moreover, we propose a dynamic stopping mechanism: when
the length of any output step exceeds the upper limit, we halt updates to
prevent hacking behavior caused by merging steps. Extensive experiments across
four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SP achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy while significantly reducing response length. For instance, on AIME24,
SP reduces token usage by \textbf{69.7\%}.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个孟加拉语政治立场检测基准数据集，包含200篇新闻文章，标注了亲政府、批评政府和中性立场。评估了28个大语言模型，发现它们在检测批评政府内容时表现良好，但在识别中性文章时存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚地区的媒体偏见检测很重要，但孟加拉语政治立场研究的标注数据集和计算研究仍然稀缺，需要理解语言线索、文化背景、微妙偏见、修辞策略等多种因素。

Method: 创建了包含200篇孟加拉语新闻文章的基准数据集，标注了三种政治立场（亲政府、批评政府、中性），并对28个专有和开源大语言模型进行了全面评估。

Result: 模型在检测批评政府内容时表现强劲（F1最高达0.83），但在识别中性文章时存在显著困难（F1最低为0.00）。模型倾向于过度预测亲政府立场，经常误解模糊叙述。

Conclusion: 该数据集及其相关诊断为推进孟加拉语媒体立场检测研究奠定了基础，并为改善低资源语言中大语言模型的性能提供了见解。

Abstract: Detecting media bias is crucial, specifically in the South Asian region.
Despite this, annotated datasets and computational studies for Bangla political
bias research remain scarce. Crucially because, political stance detection in
Bangla news requires understanding of linguistic cues, cultural context, subtle
biases, rhetorical strategies, code-switching, implicit sentiment, and
socio-political background. To address this, we introduce the first benchmark
dataset of 200 politically significant and highly debated Bangla news articles,
labeled for government-leaning, government-critique, and neutral stances,
alongside diagnostic analyses for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Our
comprehensive evaluation of 28 proprietary and open-source LLMs shows strong
performance in detecting government-critique content (F1 up to 0.83) but
substantial difficulty with neutral articles (F1 as low as 0.00). Models also
tend to over-predict government-leaning stances, often misinterpreting
ambiguous narratives. This dataset and its associated diagnostics provide a
foundation for advancing stance detection in Bangla media research and offer
insights for improving LLM performance in low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在资源匮乏语言（如波斯语）中开发文化适应、治疗连贯且具有结构化记忆的心理治疗对话系统的挑战，同时确保隐私保护和本地部署可行性。

Method: 三阶段开发流程：1) 使用PsychoLexEval评估SLMs心理知识；2) 设计面向推理的PsychoLexTherapy框架；3) 构建两个评估数据集（PsychoLexQuery和PsychoLexDialogue），比较简单提示、多代理辩论和结构化治疗推理路径。

Result: 在单轮对话评估中，PsychoLexTherapy在自动LLM评估和人工评估中均表现最佳；在多轮对话中，长期记忆模块至关重要，完整框架在同理心、连贯性、文化适应性和个性化方面获得最高评分。

Conclusion: PsychoLexTherapy为波斯语心理治疗模拟建立了实用、隐私保护且文化对齐的基础，贡献了新颖数据集、可复现评估流程以及结构化记忆对治疗推理的实证见解。

Abstract: This study presents PsychoLexTherapy, a framework for simulating
psychotherapeutic reasoning in Persian using small language models (SLMs). The
framework tackles the challenge of developing culturally grounded,
therapeutically coherent dialogue systems with structured memory for multi-turn
interactions in underrepresented languages. To ensure privacy and feasibility,
PsychoLexTherapy is optimized for on-device deployment, enabling use without
external servers. Development followed a three-stage process: (i) assessing
SLMs psychological knowledge with PsychoLexEval; (ii) designing and
implementing the reasoning-oriented PsychoLexTherapy framework; and (iii)
constructing two evaluation datasets-PsychoLexQuery (real Persian user
questions) and PsychoLexDialogue (hybrid simulated sessions)-to benchmark
against multiple baselines. Experiments compared simple prompting, multi-agent
debate, and structured therapeutic reasoning paths. Results showed that
deliberate model selection balanced accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. On
PsychoLexQuery, PsychoLexTherapy outperformed all baselines in automatic
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and was ranked highest by human evaluators in a
single-turn preference study. In multi-turn tests with PsychoLexDialogue, the
long-term memory module proved essential: while naive history concatenation
caused incoherence and information loss, the full framework achieved the
highest ratings in empathy, coherence, cultural fit, and personalization.
Overall, PsychoLexTherapy establishes a practical, privacy-preserving, and
culturally aligned foundation for Persian psychotherapy simulation,
contributing novel datasets, a reproducible evaluation pipeline, and empirical
insights into structured memory for therapeutic reasoning.

Conclusion: 从患者叙述中自动提取特质可以提供可解释、已验证的指标，用于大规模理解医患关系，对质量测量、偏见检测和医疗人力发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Understanding how patients perceive their physicians is essential to
improving trust, communication, and satisfaction. We present a large language
model (LLM)-based pipeline that infers Big Five personality traits and five
patient-oriented subjective judgments. The analysis encompasses 4.1 million
patient reviews of 226,999 U.S. physicians from an initial pool of one million.
We validate the method through multi-model comparison and human expert
benchmarking, achieving strong agreement between human and LLM assessments
(correlation coefficients 0.72-0.89) and external validity through correlations
with patient satisfaction (r = 0.41-0.81, all p<0.001). National-scale analysis
reveals systematic patterns: male physicians receive higher ratings across all
traits, with largest disparities in clinical competence perceptions;
empathy-related traits predominate in pediatrics and psychiatry; and all traits
positively predict overall satisfaction. Cluster analysis identifies four
distinct physician archetypes, from "Well-Rounded Excellent" (33.8%, uniformly
high traits) to "Underperforming" (22.6%, consistently low). These findings
demonstrate that automated trait extraction from patient narratives can provide
interpretable, validated metrics for understanding physician-patient
relationships at scale, with implications for quality measurement, bias
detection, and workforce development in healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于在长序列任务中评估LLM欺骗行为的模拟框架，发现欺骗行为具有模型依赖性、随压力增加而增加，并会持续削弱监督者信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多局限于单轮提示，无法捕捉欺骗策略在长期交互中的展开过程，需要开发能够评估长序列任务中LLM欺骗行为的框架。

Method: 构建多智能体系统：执行者智能体完成任务，监督者智能体评估进展并提供反馈，独立的欺骗审计员审查完整轨迹以识别欺骗行为。

Result: 在11个前沿模型上的实验表明，欺骗行为具有模型依赖性，随事件压力增加而增加，并持续削弱监督者信任。定性分析揭示了隐瞒、模棱两可和伪造等不同策略。

Conclusion: 研究确立了欺骗行为在长期交互中的新兴风险，为评估未来LLM在现实世界信任敏感场景中的表现提供了基础。

Abstract: Deception is a pervasive feature of human communication and an emerging
concern in large language models (LLMs). While recent studies document
instances of LLM deception under pressure, most evaluations remain confined to
single-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which
deceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce the first simulation
framework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences
of interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework
instantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing
tasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and
maintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then
reviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct
extensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and
open-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with
event pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses
further reveal distinct strategies of concealment, equivocation, and
falsification. Our findings establish deception as an emergent risk in
long-horizon interactions and provide a foundation for evaluating future LLMs
in real-world, trust-sensitive contexts.

Motivation: COVID-19疫情期间社交媒体讨论活跃，但识别相关命名实体面临两大挑战：社交媒体文本非正式且标注稀缺，以及需要大量领域专业知识。现有工作在这方面研究有限。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的实体知识增强方法，通过知识增强来弥补标注数据的不足和领域知识的缺乏，该方法可应用于一般生物医学命名实体识别任务。

Result: 在COVID-19推文数据集和PubMed数据集上的实验表明，该方法在全监督和少样本设置下都能提高命名实体识别性能。

Conclusion: 实体知识增强方法有效解决了COVID-19命名实体识别中的挑战，在社交媒体和正式文本格式中均有良好表现，为生物医学命名实体识别提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic causes severe social and economic disruption around the
world, raising various subjects that are discussed over social media.
Identifying pandemic-related named entities as expressed on social media is
fundamental and important to understand the discussions about the pandemic.
However, there is limited work on named entity recognition on this topic due to
the following challenges: 1) COVID-19 texts in social media are informal and
their annotations are rare and insufficient to train a robust recognition
model, and 2) named entity recognition in COVID-19 requires extensive
domain-specific knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a novel entity
knowledge augmentation approach for COVID-19, which can also be applied in
general biomedical named entity recognition in both informal text format and
formal text format. Experiments carried out on the COVID-19 tweets dataset and
PubMed dataset show that our proposed entity knowledge augmentation improves
NER performance in both fully-supervised and few-shot settings. Our source code

Motivation: 解决农业应用中领域定制模型稀缺、视觉语言语料库缺乏和严格评估不足的问题。

Method: 使用可扩展的多智能体数据生成器构建Agri-3M-VL语料库，通过渐进式课程训练AgriGPT-VL模型，包括文本基础、多模态浅层/深层对齐和GRPO精炼。

Result: AgriGPT-VL在AgriBench-VL-4K上优于领先的通用VLMs，在LLM-as-a-judge评估中获得更高的配对胜率，同时在文本任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源农业环境提供了可复现的研究和部署支持，消融研究证实了对齐和GRPO精炼阶段的一致增益。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural
applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models,
curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these
challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for
agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL,
the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by
a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M
image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO
reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an
agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive
curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO
refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving
text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet
challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions,
paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework.
Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on
AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge
evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K
with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further
confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will
open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and
deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.

TL;DR: 使用模型内部激活信号预测LLM输出正确性和上下文有效性，通过简单分类器实现75%准确率的早期审计，显著优于提示基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型常以高置信度生成错误信息，需要解决如何识别查询是否需要检索上下文以及评估上下文有效性的挑战。

Method: 利用可解释性方法，基于模型中间层激活训练简单分类器，预测输出正确性和上下文有效性，考虑正确、错误和不相关上下文。

Result: 在六个不同模型上的实验显示，基于第一个输出token中间层激活的分类器能以约75%准确率预测输出正确性；基于模型内部的指标在区分正确和错误上下文方面显著优于提示基准。

Conclusion: 模型内部包含关于输出正确性和上下文有效性的信号，这为更好理解LLM底层决策过程提供了视角，有助于防范受污染上下文引入的不准确性。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have tremendous utility,
trustworthiness is still a chief concern: models often generate incorrect
information with high confidence. While contextual information can help guide
generation, identifying when a query would benefit from retrieved context and
assessing the effectiveness of that context remains challenging. In this work,
we operationalize interpretability methods to ascertain whether we can predict
the correctness of model outputs from the model's activations alone. We also
explore whether model internals contain signals about the efficacy of external
context. We consider correct, incorrect, and irrelevant context and introduce
metrics to distinguish amongst them. Experiments on six different models reveal
that a simple classifier trained on intermediate layer activations of the first
output token can predict output correctness with about 75% accuracy, enabling
early auditing. Our model-internals-based metric significantly outperforms
prompting baselines at distinguishing between correct and incorrect context,
guarding against inaccuracies introduced by polluted context. These findings
offer a lens to better understand the underlying decision-making processes of
LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统音频静音端点检测存在数百毫秒延迟，且在犹豫或语言特定现象下失效，需要可靠低延迟的语音交互端点检测方法。

Method: 使用YODAS语料库转录字幕和泰语特定语言线索（如句末助词），将EOT制定为基于词元边界的二元决策，比较了零样本/少样本提示紧凑LLM与监督微调轻量级transformer的方法。

Result: 报告了清晰的准确率-延迟权衡，小型微调模型可提供近乎即时的EOT决策，适合设备端代理使用。

Conclusion: 建立了泰语EOT检测基准，证明小型微调模型能够实现适合实时设备端代理的快速EOT检测。

Abstract: Fluid voice-to-voice interaction requires reliable and low-latency detection
of when a user has finished speaking. Traditional audio-silence end-pointers
add hundreds of milliseconds of delay and fail under hesitations or
language-specific phenomena. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic
study of Thai text-only end-of-turn (EOT) detection for real-time agents. We
compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting of compact LLMs to supervised
fine-tuning of lightweight transformers. Using transcribed subtitles from the
YODAS corpus and Thai-specific linguistic cues (e.g., sentence-final
particles), we formulate EOT as a binary decision over token boundaries. We
report a clear accuracy-latency tradeoff and provide a public-ready
implementation plan. This work establishes a Thai baseline and demonstrates
that small, fine-tuned models can deliver near-instant EOT decisions suitable
for on-device agents.

Motivation: 由于LLM是黑盒模型且调用成本高，需要解释其分类决策，特别是在文本分类任务中。

Method: 引入决策改变率框架，通过反事实推理识别影响分类决策的关键词语。

Result: 实验结果表明使用反事实推理有助于识别重要词语。

Conclusion: 反事实推理能有效帮助理解LLM的分类决策过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful in many domains due to their
impressive abilities that arise from large training datasets and large model
sizes. More recently, they have been shown to be very effective in textual
classification tasks, motivating the need to explain the LLMs' decisions.
Motivated by practical constrains where LLMs are black-boxed and LLM calls are
expensive, we study how incorporating counterfactuals into LLM reasoning can
affect the LLM's ability to identify the top words that have contributed to its
classification decision. To this end, we introduce a framework called the
decision changing rate that helps us quantify the importance of the top words
in classification. Our experimental results show that using counterfactuals can
be helpful.

Conclusion: 对于急诊科决策支持，通用领域SLM已足够胜任，无需专门的医学微调，这为实际部署提供了更经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in medical
domains to assist physicians with a variety of clinical and operational tasks.
Given the fast-paced and high-stakes environment of emergency departments
(EDs), small language models (SLMs), characterized by a reduction in parameter
count compared to LLMs, offer significant potential due to their inherent
reasoning capability and efficient performance. This enables SLMs to support
physicians by providing timely and accurate information synthesis, thereby
improving clinical decision-making and workflow efficiency. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive benchmark designed to identify SLMs suited for ED
decision support, taking into account both specialized medical expertise and
broad general problem-solving capabilities. In our evaluations, we focus on
SLMs that have been trained on a mixture of general-domain and medical corpora.
A key motivation for emphasizing SLMs is the practical hardware limitations,
operational cost constraints, and privacy concerns in the typical real-world
deployments. Our benchmark datasets include MedMCQA, MedQA-4Options, and
PubMedQA, with the medical abstracts dataset emulating tasks aligned with real
ED physicians' daily tasks. Experimental results reveal that general-domain
SLMs surprisingly outperform their medically fine-tuned counterparts across
these diverse benchmarks for ED. This indicates that for ED, specialized
medical fine-tuning of the model may not be required.

Motivation: 大型语言模型通常反映相对统一的价值观，限制了其在需要理解细微人类视角任务中的应用。研究旨在探索如何让LLMs支持可引导的多元性，即能够采用特定视角并生成与之对齐的输出。

Method: 研究了多种方法：CoT提示、基于人类撰写CoT的微调、基于合成解释的微调，以及强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)。使用Value Kaleidoscope和OpinionQA数据集进行评估。

Result: 在所有研究方法中，RLVR方法表现最佳且具有强训练样本效率。对生成的CoT轨迹进行了忠实性和安全性分析。

Conclusion: 思维链推理技术可以有效构建可引导的多元模型，其中RLVR方法是最有效的实现方式，为LLMs在多元视角任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to reflect a relatively
uniform set of values, which limits their applicability to tasks that require
understanding of nuanced human perspectives. Recent research has underscored
the importance of enabling LLMs to support steerable pluralism -- the capacity
to adopt a specific perspective and align generated outputs with it. In this
work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be
applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods,
including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on
synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR). We evaluate these approaches using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA
datasets. Among the methods studied, RLVR consistently outperforms others and
demonstrates strong training sample efficiency. We further analyze the
generated CoT traces with respect to faithfulness and safety.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that diffusion language models achieve remarkable
data efficiency under limited-data constraints, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. In this work, we perform extensive ablation experiments to
disentangle the sources of this efficiency. Our results show that random
masking of input tokens plays the dominant role. We further show that similar

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PoLi-RL框架，通过两阶段课程学习和并行切片排序奖励机制，成功将强化学习应用于条件语义文本相似性任务，在C-STS基准上达到新的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有C-STS方法主要局限于判别式模型，未能充分利用LLM和强化学习的进展。强化学习特别适合该任务，可以直接优化不可微的Spearman排序指标并指导推理过程。

Method: PoLi-RL框架采用两阶段课程学习：先用简单点式奖励训练基础评分能力，然后过渡到结合点式、对式和列表式目标的混合奖励。关键创新是并行切片排序奖励机制，在并行切片中计算排序奖励。

Result: 在官方C-STS基准上，PoLi-RL实现了48.18的Spearman相关系数，为交叉编码器架构建立了新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 这是首个成功将强化学习应用于C-STS的工作，为在复杂、基于排序的条件判断任务上训练LLM引入了强大而精确的范式。

Abstract: Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) measures the semantic
proximity between text segments under a specific condition, thereby overcoming
the ambiguity inherent in traditional STS. However, existing methods are
largely confined to discriminative models, failing to fully integrate recent
breakthroughs in the NLP community concerning Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a particularly well-suited paradigm for this
task, as it can directly optimize the non-differentiable Spearman ranking
metric and guide the reasoning process required by C-STS. However, we find that
naively applying listwise RL fails to produce meaningful improvements, as the
model is overwhelmed by complex, coarse-grained reward signals. To address this
challenge, we introduce PoLi-RL, a novel Point-to-List Reinforcement Learning
framework. PoLi-RL employs a two-stage curriculum: it first trains the model
with simple pointwise rewards to establish fundamental scoring capabilities,
then transitions to a hybrid reward that combines pointwise, pairwise, and
listwise objectives to refine the model's ability to discern subtle semantic
distinctions. Crucially, we propose an innovative Parallel Slice Ranking Reward
(PSRR) mechanism that computes ranking rewards in parallel slices, where each
slice comprises same-indexed completions from different samples. This provides
a precise, differentiated learning signal for each individual completion,
enabling granular credit assignment and effective optimization. On the official
C-STS benchmark, PoLi-RL achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 48.18,
establishing a new SOTA for the cross-encoder architecture. As the first work
to successfully apply RL to C-STS, our study introduces a powerful and precise
paradigm for training LLMs on complex, ranking-based conditional judgment
tasks.

Motivation: 现有CoT方法存在生成不可控、质量不足和推理路径多样性有限的问题，而基于代码的方法通常局限于预定义的数学问题，限制了可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 首先在统一代码格式的现有数学和编程解决方案上微调基于代码的CoT生成器，然后通过代码执行和基于规则的过滤进行自动验证，确保逻辑正确性和结构多样性，最后将过滤后的输出反向工程为自然语言指令和语言CoT。

Conclusion: Caco建立了一种无需人工干预构建自持续、可信赖推理系统的范式，其代码锚定验证和指令多样性有助于在未见任务上实现优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex tasks, yet achieving reliable and scalable reasoning remains
challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a mainstream
approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation,
insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths. Recent efforts
leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but
such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems,
hindering scalability and generalizability. In this work, we propose Caco
(Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), a novel framework that automates the
synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning
data through code-driven augmentation. Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes
a code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in a
unified code format, then scales the data generation to a large amount of
diverse reasoning traces. Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code
execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural
diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural
language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability. This
closed-loop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning
data with guaranteed executability. Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M
dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive
performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong
baselines. Further analysis reveals that Caco's code-anchored verification and
instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across unseen
tasks. Our work establishes a paradigm for building self-sustaining,
trustworthy reasoning systems without human intervention.

TL;DR: 本研究从概念映射、隐喻-字面知识库和句法敏感性三个角度分析大语言模型的隐喻处理能力，发现LLMs产生15%-25%概念无关解释，依赖训练数据中的隐喻指示而非上下文线索，对句法不规则性比结构理解更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在知识整合、上下文推理和创意生成方面表现出先进能力，但其隐喻理解机制仍未得到充分探索。隐喻分析是受语境和外部因素影响的复杂语言现象。

Method: 从三个视角研究：(1)概念映射：使用嵌入空间投影评估LLMs如何在目标域中映射概念；(2)隐喻-字面知识库：分析隐喻词及其字面对应词以识别内在隐喻知识；(3)句法敏感性：评估隐喻句法结构如何影响LLMs表现。

Result: LLMs产生15%-25%概念无关解释（如将'坠入爱河'误解为'从爱中掉落'），依赖训练数据中的隐喻指示而非上下文线索，对句法不规则性比结构理解更敏感。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了LLMs在隐喻分析中的局限性，呼吁开发更强大的计算方法。

Abstract: Metaphor analysis is a complex linguistic phenomenon shaped by context and
external factors. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
capabilities in knowledge integration, contextual reasoning, and creative
generation, their mechanisms for metaphor comprehension remain insufficiently
explored. This study examines LLMs' metaphor-processing abilities from three
perspectives: (1) Concept Mapping: using embedding space projections to
evaluate how LLMs map concepts in target domains (e.g., misinterpreting "fall
in love" as "drop down from love"); (2) Metaphor-Literal Repository: analyzing
metaphorical words and their literal counterparts to identify inherent
metaphorical knowledge; and (3) Syntactic Sensitivity: assessing how
metaphorical syntactic structures influence LLMs' performance. Our findings
reveal that LLMs generate 15\%-25\% conceptually irrelevant interpretations,
depend on metaphorical indicators in training data rather than contextual cues,
and are more sensitive to syntactic irregularities than to structural
comprehension. These insights underline the limitations of LLMs in metaphor
analysis and call for more robust computational approaches.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has not been inclusive of all cultures. The
models are mostly trained on English texts and culture which makes them
underperform in other languages and cultural contexts. By developing a
generalizable method for preparing culturally relevant datasets and
post-training the Gemma 2 model, this project aimed to increase the performance
of Gemma 2 for an underrepresented language and showcase how others can do the
same to unlock the power of Generative AI in their country and preserve their

TL;DR: SSD是一种无损推理加速方法，利用扩散大语言模型自身作为推测解码的起草器和验证器，无需辅助模块，在单次前向传播中通过层次验证树验证多个位置预测，实现最高3.46倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前并行解码方法的生成结果与逐步解码存在偏差，导致性能下降，限制了实际部署。需要解决这一偏差问题。

Method: 提出自推测解码(SSD)，利用dLLM自身作为起草器和验证器，引入自起草机制生成多个位置预测，通过层次验证树在单次前向传播中验证。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream等开源模型上，SSD实现了最高3.46倍的加速，同时保持输出与逐步解码完全相同。

Conclusion: SSD通过自推测解码方法有效解决了并行解码偏差问题，实现了无损推理加速，消除了模型冗余和内存开销。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a competitive
alternative to autoregressive models, offering unique advantages through
bidirectional attention and parallel generation paradigms. However, the
generation results of current parallel decoding methods deviate from stepwise
decoding, introducing potential performance degradation, which limits their
practical deployment. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{S}elf
\textbf{S}peculative \textbf{D}ecoding (SSD), a lossless inference acceleration
method that leverages the dLLM itself as both speculative decoding drafter and
verifier without auxiliary modules. SSD introduces a self-drafting mechanism
where the model generates predictions for multiple positions, then verifies
them through hierarchical verification trees in a single forward pass. Unlike
traditional speculative decoding that requires separate draft models, SSD
eliminates model redundancy and memory overhead by exploiting the dLLM's
inherent parallel prediction capability for multiple positions. This
self-speculative approach allows the model to progressively verify and accept
multiple tokens in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that SSD
achieves up to 3.46$\times$ speedup while keeping the output identical to
stepwise decoding on open source models such as LLaDA and Dream. Code will be
made publicly available on GitHub.

*Wengao Ye,Yan Liang,Lianlei Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LTPO是一种无需参数更新的测试时优化框架，通过将中间潜在思维向量作为动态参数进行优化，使用基于置信度的内在奖励信号来增强LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM从显式思维链推理转向更高效的潜在推理，但在具有挑战性的分布外任务上，潜在推理可能不稳定。需要在不更新模型参数的情况下提升推理鲁棒性。

Method: LTPO将中间潜在思维向量视为动态参数，使用在线策略梯度方法，通过冻结LLM自身输出分布计算的置信度奖励信号进行优化，无需外部监督或文本生成。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，LTPO不仅匹配或超越强基线，还在AIME基准上实现显著改进，而现有潜在推理基线准确率接近零。

Conclusion: LTPO展示了在复杂推理任务上的独特能力，为增强LLM推理提供了一种参数高效的测试时优化方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning,
where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text.
However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution
tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free
framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring
model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as
dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It
employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic,
confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own
output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or
expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five
reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong
baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where
others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing
latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers
substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.

TL;DR: CALM框架通过轻量级修正适配方法，利用LRMs的内在推理能力进行优化建模，开发出STORM模型在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有领域适配方法无法充分利用现代大型推理模型的高级推理模式，直接微调传统非反思数据集效果有限

Method: 提出CALM框架，通过专家干预识别推理缺陷并提供修正提示，生成高质量数据用于监督微调和强化学习

Result: STORM模型在5个优化建模基准测试中达到68.9%的平均准确率，匹配671B参数LRM的性能

Conclusion: 基于提示的动态数据合成方法能够保持并增强现代LRMs的原生推理模式，为优化建模任务提供更有效和可扩展的路径

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating
optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally
designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the
advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs -- In particular, we show that
direct fine-tuning on traditional \textit{non-reflective} datasets leads to
limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs' inherent reasoning abilities, we propose
\textbf{CALM} (\textit{Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification}), a
framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes
for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies
reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM
incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions
modify fewer than 2.6\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for
soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then
further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop
\textbf{STORM} (\textit{Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model}), a
4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of
68.9\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the
performance of a 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based
data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of
modern LRMs, offering a more effective and scalable path towards expert-level
performance on challenging optimization modeling tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了REPO强化学习后训练框架，通过整合偏好奖励模型、奖励判断器和程序化奖励函数，解决LLM在商务谈判中过拟合脚本、缺乏说服力风格和无法执行业务约束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法在将大语言模型部署为商务谈判代理时存在过拟合脚本、缺乏细腻说服风格、无法强制执行可验证业务约束的问题。

Method: REPO框架结合三种奖励：偏好训练的奖励模型用于密集人类对齐，奖励判断器用于高级说服行为和SOP合规，程序化奖励函数用于数值、格式和护栏的确定性检查。

Result: 在150轮真实对话和225轮精选坏案例对话评估中，REPO将平均对话评分提升至4.63，比基线提高1.20，比DPO提高0.83；将至少包含一个优秀回复的对话比例提升至66.67%，坏案例修复率达到93.33%。

Conclusion: REPO框架在商务谈判场景中显著优于SFT、DPO、PPO和GRPO等现有方法，并涌现出主动同理心、局部推理和校准策略等超越黄金标注的新能力。

Abstract: We study deploying large language models (LLMs) as business development (BD)
agents for persuasive price negotiation in online travel agencies (OTAs), where
aligning traveler affordability and hotel profitability directly affects
bookings, partner relationships, and access to travel. The agent must follow a
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while conducting multi-turn persuasion,
interpreting colloquial inputs, and adhering to guardrails (no over-promising,
no hallucinations). Conventional post-training -- supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or single-source reward optimization -- overfits scripts, misses nuanced
persuasive style, and fails to enforce verifiable business constraints.
  We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement
learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards:
a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward
judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and
programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics,
formatting, and guardrails. A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed
to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve
negotiation quality. In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns
from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts
average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO); +0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to
66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix
rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO. We also
observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning,
calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs生成文本存在同质化问题，可能导致知识崩溃。本文提出新方法测量认知多样性，发现新模型虽多样性有所提升，但仍不及基础网络搜索，且模型规模对多样性有负面影响，RAG则有正面作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究局限于封闭式选择题或模糊语义特征，未能考察跨时间和文化背景的趋势。LLM文本同质化可能导致知识崩溃风险，即随时间推移可获取信息范围缩小。

Method: 提出测量认知多样性的新方法，测试27个LLM、155个涵盖12个国家的主题、200个真实用户聊天提示变体，分析LLM输出中现实世界主张的多样性。

Result: 新模型生成更多样化主张，但几乎所有模型认知多样性低于基础网络搜索；模型规模对认知多样性有负面影响；RAG有正面影响，但改善程度因文化背景而异；相比维基百科，国家特定主张更多反映英语而非当地语言。

Conclusion: LLM存在认知多样性不足问题，模型规模扩大反而降低多样性，RAG能改善但效果受文化背景影响，需要关注认知表征中的语言偏向问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and
stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where
homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over
time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended
multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends
across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new
methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world
claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM
knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200
prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we
show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all
models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that
model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the
improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a
traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims
reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in
epistemic representation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注英语推理，对语言特定推理了解不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 使用语言混合思维链推理模式，在英语和目标语言之间切换，利用英语作为锚点进行推理。构建了包含579万韩语提示和370万长推理轨迹的Yi-Sang数据集。

Result: 最佳模型KO-REAson-35B在9个基准测试中取得最高平均分64.0，在5/9个基准中排名第一，其余排名第二。中小型模型平均提升18.6分。

Conclusion: 语言混合CoT比单语CoT更有效，还能带来跨语言和多模态性能提升。

Abstract: Recent frontier models employ long chain-of-thought reasoning to explore
solution spaces in context and achieve stonger performance. While many works
study distillation to build smaller yet capable models, most focus on English
and little is known about language-specific reasoning. To bridge this gap, we
first introduct **Language-Mixed CoT**, a reasoning schema that switches
between English and a target language, using English as an anchor to excel in
reasoning while minimizing translation artificats. As a Korean case study, we
curate **Yi-Sang**: 5.79M native-Korean prompts from web Q&A, exams, STEM, and
code; 3.7M long reasoning traces generated from Qwen3-32B; and a targeted 260k
high-yield subset. We train ninve models (4B-35B) across six families (Qwen2.5,
Llama-3.1, Gemma-3, etc). Our best model, **KO-REAson-35B**, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the highest overall average score (64.0 \pm
25), ranking first on 5/9 benchmarks and second on the remainder. Samller and
mid-sized models also benefit substantially, with an average improvement of
+18.6 points across teh evaluated nine benchmarks. Ablations show
**Language-Mixed CoT** is more effective than monolingual CoT, also resulting
in cross-lingual and mult-modal performance gains. We release our data-curation
pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and models to advance research on
language-specific reasoning. Data and model collection:

TL;DR: 提出了LongTail-Swap基准测试，专注于评估语言模型在罕见词学习上的表现，发现不同架构在长尾分布上的性能差异比头部更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BabyLM挑战主要关注词汇分布的头部，而儿童学习语言时能够高效学习罕见词，因此需要专门评估模型在长尾分布上的表现。

Method: 构建了基于BabyLM训练集的LT-Swap测试集，包含可接受与不可接受句子对，通过零样本方式评估模型对罕见词语义和句法使用的理解能力。

Result: 评估了16个BabyLM排行榜模型，发现语言模型在罕见词上表现较差，且不同架构在长尾分布上的性能差异比头部更显著。

Conclusion: LT-Swap基准提供了新的视角来评估哪种架构更适合处理罕见词泛化问题，揭示了模型在长尾分布学习能力上的重要差异。

Abstract: Children learn to speak with a low amount of data and can be taught new words
on a few-shot basis, making them particularly data-efficient learners. The
BabyLM challenge aims at exploring language model (LM) training in the low-data
regime but uses metrics that concentrate on the head of the word distribution.
Here, we introduce LongTail-Swap (LT-Swap), a benchmark that focuses on the
tail of the distribution, i.e., measures the ability of LMs to learn new words
with very little exposure, like infants do. LT-Swap is a pretraining
corpus-specific test set of acceptable versus unacceptable sentence pairs that
isolate semantic and syntactic usage of rare words. Models are evaluated in a
zero-shot fashion by computing the average log probabilities over the two
members of each pair. We built two such test sets associated with the 10M words
and 100M words BabyLM training sets, respectively, and evaluated 16 models from
the BabyLM leaderboard. Our results not only highlight the poor performance of
language models on rare words but also reveal that performance differences
across LM architectures are much more pronounced in the long tail than in the
head. This offers new insights into which architectures are better at handling
rare word generalization. We've also made the code publicly avail

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要量化大语言模型如何学习和内化高阶统计结构，理解模型在不同类型文本处理中的特征学习机制。

Method: 将每层logit分布的softmax熵视为围绕其"中心"分布的扰动，推导出封闭形式的累积量观测值来隔离逐次高阶相关性，并在GPT-2和Pythia模型上实证追踪这些累积量。

Result: (i)结构化提示在层间呈现上升-平台特征，而token打乱的提示保持平坦；(ii)训练过程中所有累积量单调增加后饱和；(iii)数学提示与一般文本显示不同的累积量特征。

Conclusion: 累积量分析成为高维神经网络中特征学习动态的轻量级、数学基础扎实的探测工具。

Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large
language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during
next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit
distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive
closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order
correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models
on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic
rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain
flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context.
(ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating,
directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to
learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii)
Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general
text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing
mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results
establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of
feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.

TL;DR: SliceMoE是一种改进的混合专家架构，将token的隐藏向量分割成多个切片，每个切片独立路由到专家，解决了传统token级路由的容量瓶颈、负载均衡问题和有限专业化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE层的token级路由将整个语义谱分配给每个专家，导致容量瓶颈、负载均衡病理和有限的专业化能力。

Method: 将d维嵌入分割为S个切片，每个切片由轻量级共享路由器预测top-k专家。专家独立处理分配的切片，输出重新组装，保持每个token的FLOP效率。提出了切片级容量损失、跨切片dropout和高效融合批处理GEMM内核。

Result: 在WikiText-103语言建模、WMT En-De翻译和三个文本分类数据集上，SliceMoE比密集基线推理速度快1.7倍，比参数匹配的token-MoE困惑度降低12-18%，专家平衡性改善，在句法与语义子空间上具有可解释的专业化能力。

Conclusion: SliceMoE通过切片级路由有效解决了传统MoE架构的问题，实现了更好的性能、效率和专家专业化。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers scale transformers by routing tokens to a
sparse subset of feed-forward experts. Token-level routing, however, assigns an
entire semantic spectrum to each expert, creating capacity bottlenecks,
load-balancing pathologies, and limited specialization. We introduce SliceMoE,
an architecture that routes contiguous slices of a token's hidden vector. A
d-dimensional embedding is partitioned into S slices, and for each slice, a
lightweight shared router predicts the top-k experts. Experts operate on their
assigned slices independently, and outputs are reassembled, maintaining
per-token FLOP efficiency. Because slices from different tokens interleave
within an expert, utilization is naturally smoother. We propose a slice-level
capacity loss, cross-slice dropout, and efficient fused batched GEMM kernels.
Experiments on WikiText-103 language modeling, WMT En-De translation, and three
text-classification datasets show SliceMoE attains up to 1.7x faster inference
than dense baselines, 12 to 18 percent lower perplexity than parameter-matched
token-MoE, and improved expert balance, with interpretable expertise over
syntactic versus semantic subspaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语情感分析面临标注数据集稀缺、预处理工具有限以及缺乏高质量嵌入和特征提取方法的挑战，需要解决这些限制来推进低资源语言的情感分析研究。

Method: 采用混合方法整合机器学习和深度学习技术，利用多语言BERT的极性分数作为额外特征，并引入波斯语同义词和实体词典进行文本增强。

Result: 在Pars-ABSA数据集上实现了93.34%的准确率，超越了现有基准，证明了混合建模和特征增强的有效性。

Conclusion: 混合建模和特征增强方法能够有效推进波斯语等低资源语言的情感分析研究，为类似语言的情感分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
enabling the extraction of meaningful insights from user opinions across
various domains. However, performing sentiment analysis in Persian remains
challenging due to the scarcity of labeled datasets, limited preprocessing
tools, and the lack of high-quality embeddings and feature extraction methods.
To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for Persian
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). In particular, we utilize polarity
scores from multilingual BERT as additional features and incorporate them into
a decision tree classifier, achieving an accuracy of 93.34%-surpassing existing
benchmarks on the Pars-ABSA dataset. Additionally, we introduce a Persian
synonym and entity dictionary, a novel linguistic resource that supports text
augmentation through synonym and named entity replacement. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid modeling and feature augmentation in
advancing sentiment analysis for low-resource languages such as Persian.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法将检索到的段落视为孤立块，忽略了文档组织结构这一关键信息，导致知识获取和利用效率不足。

Method: RDR2采用基于LLM的路由器动态导航文档结构树，联合评估内容相关性和层次关系，将文档路由制定为可训练任务，并采用自动动作管理和结构感知段落选择策略。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的数据集上，RDR2实现了最先进的性能，特别是在需要多文档合成的复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 显式结构感知显著增强了RAG系统获取和利用知识的能力，证明了文档结构信息在检索增强生成中的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, their
reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by leveraging external
documents, yet existing approaches treat retrieved passages as isolated chunks,
ignoring valuable structure that is crucial for document organization.
Motivated by this gap, we propose Retrieve-DocumentRoute-Read (RDR2), a novel
framework that explicitly incorporates structural information throughout the
RAG process. RDR2 employs an LLM-based router to dynamically navigate document
structure trees, jointly evaluating content relevance and hierarchical
relationships to assemble optimal evidence. Our key innovation lies in
formulating document routing as a trainable task, with automatic action
curation and structure-aware passage selection inspired by human reading
strategies. Through comprehensive evaluation on five challenging datasets, RDR2
achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that explicit structural
awareness significantly enhances RAG systems' ability to acquire and utilize
knowledge, particularly in complex scenarios requiring multi-document
synthesis.

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Correctness Score (DCS)评估指标，通过考虑模型在答案选择上的完整概率分布来区分有害的过度自信和通过弃权表达的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估范式只关注单一响应的准确性评分，无法捕捉模型的完整信念状态，导致模型因优化二元评分方案而产生幻觉。

Method: 引入DCS评估指标，通过理论分析和示例演示，将12个现有评估基准适配到DCS变体，并在6个语言模型上测量性能。

Result: 在测试的基准中，一半的基准在所有测试模型上得分均为负值，表明存在显著的幻觉倾向。

Conclusion: DCS提供了一个更细致和一致的评价范式，激励模型表达真正的不确定性而非猜测。

Abstract: Common evaluation paradigms for language models focus on scoring single
responses through accuracy metrics or proper scoring rules, failing to capture
the full richness of a model's belief state. Recent work illustrates that
language models hallucinate in-part because they are optimised to be good
test-takers under binary scoring schemes that reward any answer over
abstention. While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches,
they ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for
example between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward "I don't
know" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness
Score (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a
model's entire probability distribution over answer choices. DCS naturally
distinguishes between harmful overconfidence in wrong answers and uncertainty
expressed through abstention, providing scores in an interpretable default
range. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, DCS is
demonstrated to offer a more nuanced and aligned evaluation paradigm that
incentivises models to express genuine uncertainty rather than guessing.
Adapting 12 existing evaluation benchmarks to DCS's variants and measuring
performance on six language models reveals that for half of the tested
benchmarks scores are negative across all tested models, indicating significant
tendencies towards hallucination.

*Rui Wu,Yihao Quan,Zeru Shi,Zhenting Wang,Yanshu Li,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现安全对齐的大语言模型存在后果盲视问题，即模型弱于推理行动与后果之间的联系，过度依赖表面形式信号。作者构建了CB-Bench基准和CS-Chain-4k数据集来评估和缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前安全对齐的LLMs存在两种主要失败模式：容易被越狱攻击，以及对无害输入过度拒绝。作者认为这两种问题都源于模型缺乏对行动后果的推理能力，过度依赖表面形式信号。

Method: 构建CB-Bench基准评估后果盲视问题，涵盖四种风险场景；开发CS-Chain-4k数据集用于安全对齐，通过微调模型来增强后果推理能力。

Result: 主流模型在CB-Bench上持续无法区分语义风险和结果风险，表现出系统性的后果盲视。使用CS-Chain-4k微调的模型在对抗语义伪装越狱攻击方面表现更好，减少了对无害输入的过度拒绝，同时保持了在其他基准上的效用和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 后果盲视是当前对齐方法的一个系统性限制，后果感知推理应成为核心对齐目标，该研究为更实用和可复现的评估提供了路径。

modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that
contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current
models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on
surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode
consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study
consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk
scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling
evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored
by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate
these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that
consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate
consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning
dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains
against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless
inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These
results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware
reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and
reproducible evaluation path.

*Mathieu Laï-king,Patrick Paroubek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型评估临床试验研究报告质量的能力，使用CONSORT标准创建了CONSORT-QA评估语料库，通过不同提示方法测试模型性能，最佳组合达到85%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验研究报告质量影响临床决策，需要有效评估方法。

Method: 创建CONSORT-QA评估语料库，使用不同大型生成语言模型和提示方法（包括思维链）评估CONSORT标准。

Result: 最佳模型和提示方法组合达到85%准确率，思维链提供了有价值的推理信息。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效评估临床试验研究报告质量，思维链方法增强了模型推理能力。

Abstract: Reporting quality is an important topic in clinical trial research articles,
as it can impact clinical decisions. In this article, we test the ability of
large language models to assess the reporting quality of this type of article
using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). We create
CONSORT-QA, an evaluation corpus from two studies on abstract reporting quality
with CONSORT-abstract standards. We then evaluate the ability of different
large generative language models (from the general domain or adapted to the
biomedical domain) to correctly assess CONSORT criteria with different known
prompting methods, including Chain-of-thought. Our best combination of model
and prompting method achieves 85% accuracy. Using Chain-of-thought adds
valuable information on the model's reasoning for completing the task.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出接种提示法：通过在微调数据前添加简短系统提示来故意引发不良特征，测试时不使用该提示，从而降低模型表达不良特征的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型微调时常会同时学习到期望和不期望的特征，需要一种方法能够选择性地学习期望特征而抑制不期望特征。

Method: 在微调数据前添加系统提示指令，故意引发不期望的特征，使模型在测试时不使用该指令的情况下减少不良特征的表达。

Result: 接种方法在多个场景中有效：减少任务特定微调中的突发不对齐、防御后门注入、缓解潜意识学习中的特征传递。

Conclusion: 接种提示法是一种简单有效的选择性学习技术，通过使特征不再意外来减少优化压力，从而降低泛化程度，有助于更好理解语言模型的泛化机制。

Abstract: Language model finetuning often results in learning undesirable traits in
combination with desired ones. To address this, we propose inoculation
prompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt
instruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we
evaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression
of the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is
selective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and
ALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'')
teaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We
find that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings:
reducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending
against backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via
subliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait
less surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally
update the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis
relates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that
educational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a
simple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute
to a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize.

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练语言模型中的后门攻击，提出了一种基于注意力机制和梯度信息的推理时防御方法，能显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然在各种NLP任务中表现优异，但容易受到后门攻击的威胁，攻击者通过在训练数据中嵌入触发模式来植入恶意行为。

Method: 提出了一种推理时防御方法，通过结合token级别的注意力信息和梯度信息来构建异常分数，检测后门触发。

Result: 在多种文本分类任务和不同后门攻击场景下的实验表明，该方法相比现有基线方法显著降低了攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效防御后门攻击，还通过可解释性分析揭示了触发定位机制和防御的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly when fine-tuned
on large, domain-relevant datasets. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in
the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when
activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate
the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models,
focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when
processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention
and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an
inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level
attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text
classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that
our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing
baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the
scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of
the proposed defense.

TL;DR: 提出Con-RAG系统解决RAG在语义等价查询下输出不一致的问题，通过PS-GRPO强化学习方法训练生成器，在多个QA基准测试中显著提升一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统在语义等价查询下输出不一致，影响可靠性和用户信任，特别是在高风险领域部署时。

Method: 提出PS-GRPO强化学习方法，使用转述查询集进行群体相似度奖励，并引入可扩展的近似计算方法。

Result: 在短格式、多跳和长格式QA基准测试中，Con-RAG在一致性和准确性方面均显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 为安全关键部署提供了评估和构建可靠RAG系统的实用解决方案。

Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where users
expect outputs to be consistent across semantically equivalent queries.
However, existing systems often exhibit significant inconsistencies due to
variability in both the retriever and generator (LLM), undermining trust and
reliability. In this work, we focus on information consistency, i.e., the
requirement that outputs convey the same core content across semantically
equivalent inputs. We introduce a principled evaluation framework that
decomposes RAG consistency into retriever-level, generator-level, and
end-to-end components, helping identify inconsistency sources. To improve
consistency, we propose Paraphrased Set Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PS-GRPO), an RL approach that leverages multiple rollouts across paraphrased
set to assign group similarity rewards. We leverage PS-GRPO to achieve
Information Consistent RAG (Con-RAG), training the generator to produce
consistent outputs across paraphrased queries and remain robust to
retrieval-induced variability. Because exact reward computation over paraphrase
sets is computationally expensive, we also introduce a scalable approximation
method that retains effectiveness while enabling efficient, large-scale
training. Empirical evaluations across short-form, multi-hop, and long-form QA
benchmarks demonstrate that Con-RAG significantly improves both consistency and
accuracy over strong baselines, even in the absence of explicit ground-truth
supervision. Our work provides practical solutions for evaluating and building
reliable RAG systems for safety-critical deployments.

Motivation: 量化语法错误修正工具的实际可用性，了解GEC工具能为用户节省多少编辑时间。

Method: 构建了两个英语GEC测试数据集的大规模后编辑时间标注和修正数据集，提出PEET评分器来估计后编辑时间。

Result: 分析表明，判断句子是否需要修正以及改写和标点符号更改等编辑类型对后编辑时间影响最大。PEET与人类技术努力判断相关性良好。

Conclusion: PEET为评估GEC工具可用性提供了新的人类中心方向，能够有效量化GEC工具在文本编辑中节省的时间。

Abstract: Text editing can involve several iterations of revision. Incorporating an
efficient Grammar Error Correction (GEC) tool in the initial correction round
can significantly impact further human editing effort and final text quality.
This raises an interesting question to quantify GEC Tool usability: How much
effort can the GEC Tool save users? We present the first large-scale dataset of
post-editing (PE) time annotations and corrections for two English GEC test
datasets (BEA19 and CoNLL14). We introduce Post-Editing Effort in Time (PEET)
for GEC Tools as a human-focused evaluation scorer to rank any GEC Tool by
estimating PE time-to-correct. Using our dataset, we quantify the amount of
time saved by GEC Tools in text editing. Analyzing the edit type indicated that
determining whether a sentence needs correction and edits like paraphrasing and
punctuation changes had the greatest impact on PE time. Finally, comparison
with human rankings shows that PEET correlates well with technical effort
judgment, providing a new human-centric direction for evaluating GEC tool
usability. We release our dataset and code at:

TL;DR: 提出了SECA方法，通过语义等价且连贯的对抗攻击来引发LLM幻觉，相比现有方法能产生更现实的提示且保持语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法产生的提示要么包含无意义标记，要么改变原意，无法反映实践中幻觉发生的真实情况。

Method: 将寻找现实攻击表述为语义等价和连贯约束下的优化问题，采用保持约束的零阶方法搜索对抗性提示。

Result: 在开放式多选题任务上，SECA实现了更高的攻击成功率，且几乎不违反约束条件。

Conclusion: SECA揭示了开源和商业LLM对现实且合理的提示变体具有敏感性，为理解实际场景中的幻觉问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains.
However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious
concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks
for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic
prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original
meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how
hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer
vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of
finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has
remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically
Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic
modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining
semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding
realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization
problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence
constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to
effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we
demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question
answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring
almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights
the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs
to realistic and plausible prompt variations. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索文本语义与大型语言模型的相关性，验证LLM生成文本是否保持语义同位素。

Method: 使用10,000个ROCStories提示，由5个LLM完成故事续写，先验证GPT-4o提取同位素的能力，然后分析生成故事的结构和语义特性。

Result: 结果显示LLM在给定token范围内完成文本时，能够跨多个属性保持语义同位素。

Conclusion: LLM在特定token范围内生成文本时能够有效保持语义同位素。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the relevance of textual semantics to Large Language
Models (LLMs), extending previous insights into the connection between
distributional semantics and structural semantics. We investigate whether
LLM-generated texts preserve semantic isotopies. We design a story continuation
experiment using 10,000 ROCStories prompts completed by five LLMs. We first
validate GPT-4o's ability to extract isotopies from a linguistic benchmark,
then apply it to the generated stories. We then analyze structural (coverage,
density, spread) and semantic properties of isotopies to assess how they are
affected by completion. Results show that LLM completion within a given token
horizon preserves semantic isotopies across multiple properties.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NLP社会影响力的增加，NLP4SG研究日益重要。研究旨在量化ACL社区内外作者在NLP4SG领域的贡献分布，了解该领域的发展格局。

Method: 采用作者和会议层面的分析方法，通过量化ACL社区内外作者在NLP4SG相关工作中的比例，绘制NLP4SG领域的发展图景。

Result: 发现两个重要事实：1）ACL作者在ACL外部会议发表时从事社会公益研究的可能性显著更高；2）绝大多数使用NLP技术解决社会公益问题的研究由非ACL作者在ACL外部完成。

Conclusion: 这些发现对ACL社区在NLP4SG领域的议程设置具有重要启示，需要重新思考如何更好地支持和促进社会公益导向的NLP研究。

Abstract: The social impact of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is increasingly
important, with a rising community focus on initiatives related to NLP for
Social Good (NLP4SG). Indeed, in recent years, almost 20% of all papers in the
ACL Anthology address topics related to social good as defined by the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (Adauto et al., 2023). In this study, we take an
author- and venue-level perspective to map the landscape of NLP4SG, quantifying
the proportion of work addressing social good concerns both within and beyond
the ACL community, by both core ACL contributors and non-ACL authors. With this
approach we discover two surprising facts about the landscape of NLP4SG. First,
ACL authors are dramatically more likely to do work addressing social good
concerns when publishing in venues outside of ACL. Second, the vast majority of
publications using NLP techniques to address concerns of social good are done
by non-ACL authors in venues outside of ACL. We discuss the implications of
these findings on agenda-setting considerations for the ACL community related
to NLP4SG.

Motivation: 现有基于熵估计的不确定性量化方法主要依赖观测到的输出序列，但忽略了未观测序列的概率，这可能影响不确定性估计的准确性。

Method: 通过实验验证未观测序列概率在不确定性量化中的重要性，建议未来研究将其整合到LLM不确定性量化方法中。

Result: 实验结果表明未观测序列的概率在不确定性量化中起着关键作用。

Conclusion: 未来研究应该整合未观测序列的概率来增强LLM不确定性量化方法的效果。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) is important for
safety-critical applications because it helps spot incorrect answers, known as
hallucinations. One major trend of uncertainty quantification methods is based
on estimating the entropy of the distribution of the LLM's potential output
sequences. This estimation is based on a set of output sequences and associated
probabilities obtained by querying the LLM several times. In this paper, we
advocate and experimentally show that the probability of unobserved sequences
plays a crucial role, and we recommend future research to integrate it to
enhance such LLM uncertainty quantification methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个即插即用框架，通过动态选择困难样本进行监督微调，将SFT与强化学习结合，显著减少数据需求并避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法结合SFT和RL面临数据效率低、算法特定设计和灾难性遗忘三大挑战，需要更高效的集成方案。

Method: 动态选择困难样本进行SFT，选择高熵token计算损失，并冻结对RL重要的参数。

Result: 仅使用1.5%的SFT数据和20.4%的RL数据就达到了最先进的推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为推理后训练中结合SFT和RL提供了高效且即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities, often amplified
by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning (RL). Although
RL algorithms can substantially improve reasoning, they struggle to expand
reasoning boundaries because they learn from their own reasoning trajectories
rather than acquiring external knowledge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers
complementary benefits but typically requires large-scale data and risks
overfitting. Recent attempts to combine SFT and RL face three main challenges:
data inefficiency, algorithm-specific designs, and catastrophic forgetting. We
propose a plug-and-play framework that dynamically integrates SFT into RL by
selecting challenging examples for SFT. This approach reduces SFT data
requirements and remains agnostic to the choice of RL or SFT algorithm. To
mitigate catastrophic forgetting of RL-acquired skills during SFT, we select
high-entropy tokens for loss calculation and freeze parameters identified as
critical for RL. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) reasoning
performance using only 1.5% of the SFT data and 20.4% of the RL data used by
prior SoTA, providing an efficient and plug-and-play solution for combining SFT
and RL in reasoning post-training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCA是一种新型注意力机制，通过将查询、键和值下投影到共享潜在空间来显著减少参数、KV缓存和FLOPs，结合GQA形成CCGQA进一步优化计算-带宽权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头注意力机制在长上下文场景下存在二次计算复杂度和线性增长的KV缓存问题，导致训练和服务成本高昂。现有方法如GQA和MLA主要优化缓存但计算效率提升有限。

Method: CCA将查询、键和值下投影到共享潜在空间，在潜在空间内执行整个注意力操作。CCA与头共享正交，结合GQA形成CCGQA，允许用户根据FLOP或内存限制调整压缩率。

Result: CCGQA在相同KV缓存压缩下优于GQA和MLA，在MoE模型上以GQA和MLA一半的KV缓存实现8倍压缩且性能无损失。CCA/CCGQA显著减少注意力FLOP成本，在H100 GPU上16k序列长度时预填充延迟降低约1.7倍，反向传播加速约1.3倍。

Conclusion: CCA和CCGQA通过压缩注意力机制有效解决了长上下文Transformer的计算和内存瓶颈，在保持性能的同时显著提升了训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Multi-headed Attention's (MHA) quadratic compute and linearly growing
KV-cache make long-context transformers expensive to train and serve. Prior
works such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)
shrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill
and training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional
Attention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,
and values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent
space. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all
at once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to
head-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query
Attention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier
so that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without
sacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both
GQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models.
Additionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE
models with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache
compression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA
also dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to
substantially faster training and prefill than existing methods. On H100 GPUs,
our fused CCA/CCGQA kernel reduces prefill latency by about 1.7x at a sequence
length of 16k relative to MHA, and accelerates backward by about 1.3x.

Motivation: 控制LLM的模拟情绪状态和人格特质对于在社交互动环境中实现丰富、以人为中心的交互至关重要。

Method: 使用PsySET基准测试，涵盖四个不同LLM家族模型，结合多种引导策略（提示法、微调、表示工程），评估安全、真实、公平和伦理等可信度维度。

Result: 提示法持续有效但强度控制有限；向量注入实现更精细可控性但轻微降低输出质量；发现独特效应：积极情绪如喜悦会降低对对抗性事实的鲁棒性、降低隐私意识、增加偏好偏见；愤怒可预测地增加毒性但增强泄漏抵抗。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了首个对情绪和人格引导的整体评估，为社交互动应用中的可解释性和可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: The ability to control LLMs' emulated emotional states and personality traits
is essential for enabling rich, human-centered interactions in socially
interactive settings. We introduce PsySET, a Psychologically-informed benchmark
to evaluate LLM Steering Effectiveness and Trustworthiness across the emotion
and personality domains. Our study spans four models from different LLM
families paired with various steering strategies, including prompting,
fine-tuning, and representation engineering. Our results indicate that
prompting is consistently effective but limited in intensity control, whereas
vector injections achieve finer controllability while slightly reducing output
quality. Moreover, we explore the trustworthiness of steered LLMs by assessing
safety, truthfulness, fairness, and ethics, highlighting potential side effects
and behavioral shifts. Notably, we observe idiosyncratic effects; for instance,
even a positive emotion like joy can degrade robustness to adversarial
factuality, lower privacy awareness, and increase preferential bias. Meanwhile,
anger predictably elevates toxicity yet strengthens leakage resistance. Our
framework establishes the first holistic evaluation of emotion and personality
steering, offering insights into its interpretability and reliability for
socially interactive applications.

narrative coherence while allowing learner-driven plot development. Key
pedagogical features include content generation tailored to each learner's
proficiency level, and a vocabulary assistant that provides in-context
explanations of learner-queried text strings, ranging from words and phrases to
sentences. Findings from a pilot study with university EFL students in China
indicate promising vocabulary gains and positive user perceptions. Also
discussed are suggestions from participants regarding the narrative length and

Motivation: 现有的LLM文本编码器训练方法依赖于对比损失，将模型视为黑盒函数，丢弃了其生成和推理能力，仅产生静态嵌入。

Abstract: Prevailing methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) as text encoders
rely on contrastive losses that treat the model as a black box function,
discarding its generative and reasoning capabilities in favor of static
embeddings. We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via
Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive
signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative
policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit,
human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its
semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality
embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the
model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between
query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms
the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning
process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad
cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting
improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant
adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive
objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with
generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales. The
model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/GRACE.

Conclusion: ALC策略能有效提升产品推荐系统的自动化覆盖率，满足生产系统的实际需求。

Abstract: Product recommendation is the task of recovering the closest items to a given
query within a large product corpora. Generally, one can determine if
top-ranked products are related to the query by applying a similarity
threshold; exceeding it deems the product relevant, otherwise manual revision
is required. Despite being a well-known problem, the integration of these
models in real-world systems is often overlooked. In particular, production
systems have strong coverage requirements, i.e., a high proportion of
recommendations must be automated. In this paper we propose ALC , an Auxiliary
Learning strategy that boosts Coverage through learning fine-grained
embeddings. Concretely, we introduce two training objectives that leverage the
hardest negatives in the batch to build discriminative training signals between
positives and negatives. We validate ALC using three extreme multi-label
classification approaches in two product recommendation datasets;
LF-AmazonTitles-131K and Tech and Durables (proprietary), demonstrating
state-of-the-art coverage rates when combined with a recent
threshold-consistent margin loss.

TL;DR: 研究LLMs如何表示和解释复数指称，发现LLMs有时能识别模糊代词的指称对象，但在选择解释时与人类偏好不一致，且难以识别模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在模糊和明确语境中表示和解释复数指称的能力，以及它们是否具有类似人类的偏好。

Method: 设计实验，包括使用下一个词预测任务的代词生成、代词解释和不同提示策略的模糊性检测。

Result: LLMs有时能识别模糊代词的指称对象，但在选择解释时与人类偏好不一致，尤其是在可能解释未被明确提及时。此外，它们难以在没有直接指令的情况下识别模糊性。

Conclusion: LLMs在复数指称表示和解释方面与人类存在差异，结果在不同类型实验中存在不一致性。

Abstract: Our goal is to study how LLMs represent and interpret plural reference in
ambiguous and unambiguous contexts. We ask the following research questions:
(1) Do LLMs exhibit human-like preferences in representing plural reference?
(2) Are LLMs able to detect ambiguity in plural anaphoric expressions and
identify possible referents? To address these questions, we design a set of
experiments, examining pronoun production using next-token prediction tasks,
pronoun interpretation, and ambiguity detection using different prompting
strategies. We then assess how comparable LLMs are to humans in formulating and
interpreting plural reference. We find that LLMs are sometimes aware of
possible referents of ambiguous pronouns. However, they do not always follow
human reference when choosing between interpretations, especially when the
possible interpretation is not explicitly mentioned. In addition, they struggle
to identify ambiguity without direct instruction. Our findings also reveal
inconsistencies in the results across different types of experiments.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型音频语言模型在多项选择问答评估中对选项顺序、问题表述和选项改写敏感，提出新的评估协议和指标来解决这种变异性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCQA评估框架只报告单一准确率，但选项顺序等细微变化会导致结果显著不同，需要更细致的评估方法。

Method: 在三个基准测试(MMAU、MMAR、MMSU)和四个模型上系统研究选项顺序、问题改写和选项改写对结果的影响。

Result: 模型对选项顺序、问题表述和选项改写都表现出敏感性，现有评估方法无法捕捉这种变异性。

Conclusion: 提出了考虑细微变异的更简单评估协议和指标，为MCQA框架下的LALMs提供更详细的评估报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have primarily been
assessed using a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) framework. However,
subtle changes, such as shifting the order of choices, result in substantially
different results. Existing MCQA frameworks do not account for this variability
and report a single accuracy number per benchmark or category. We dive into the
MCQA evaluation framework and conduct a systematic study spanning three
benchmarks (MMAU, MMAR and MMSU) and four models: Audio Flamingo 2, Audio
Flamingo 3, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B-Instruct, and Kimi-Audio-7B-Instruct. Our findings
indicate that models are sensitive not only to the ordering of choices, but
also to the paraphrasing of the question and the choices. Finally, we propose a
simpler evaluation protocol and metric that account for subtle variations and
provide a more detailed evaluation report of LALMs within the MCQA framework.

TL;DR: FedSRD是一个通信高效的联邦学习框架，通过稀疏化-重构-分解三步法，在保持LoRA微调效果的同时显著降低通信开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于公开网络数据训练大语言模型的范式不可持续，高质量专业领域数据接近枯竭。联邦学习虽然能利用分布式私有数据进行隐私保护协作微调，但LoRA在联邦环境中的通信开销和参数冲突问题严重阻碍了其应用

Method: 提出FedSRD框架：1)重要性感知稀疏化，减少上传参数数量；2)服务器在完整秩空间重构和聚合更新，缓解冲突；3)将全局更新分解为稀疏低秩格式进行广播。还提出了计算开销更低的变体FedSRD-e

Result: 在10个基准测试上，该框架将通信成本降低高达90%，同时在异构客户端数据上甚至提升了模型性能

Conclusion: FedSRD成功解决了联邦学习中LoRA微调的通信瓶颈问题，为下一代去中心化网络上的AI发展提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: The current paradigm of training large language models (LLMs) on publicly
available Web data is becoming unsustainable, with high-quality data sources in
specialized domains nearing exhaustion. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a
practical solution for the next generation of AI on a decentralized Web,
enabling privacy-preserving collaborative fine-tuning by leveraging private
data distributed across a global client base. While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is the standard for efficient fine-tuning, its application in federated
settings presents a critical challenge: communication overhead remains a
significant bottleneck across the Web's heterogeneous network conditions. The
structural redundancy within LoRA parameters not only incurs a heavy
communication burden but also introduces conflicts when aggregating client
updates. To address this, we propose FedSRD, a Sparsify-Reconstruct-Decompose
framework designed for communication-efficient FL. We first introduce an
importance-aware sparsification method that preserves the structural integrity
of LoRA updates to reduce the uploaded parameter count. The server then
reconstructs and aggregates these updates in a full-rank space to mitigate
conflicts. Finally, it decomposes the global update into a sparse low-rank
format for broadcast, ensuring a symmetrically efficient cycle. We also propose
an efficient variant, FedSRD-e, to reduce computational overhead. Experimental
results on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces
communication costs by up to 90\% while even improving model performance on
heterogeneous client data.

Motivation: 大规模网络爬取文本语料库常包含有害的人口统计目标社会偏见，需要数据审计和可扩展的偏见检测方法，但现有研究范围狭窄，缺乏对LLM自动偏见检测能力的全面理解。

Method: 构建了针对英语文本的综合评估框架，将偏见检测定义为多标签任务，使用人口统计聚焦的分类法，系统评估了不同规模和技术的模型，包括提示、上下文学习和微调。

Result: 使用12个涵盖不同内容类型和人口统计的数据集，研究表明微调的小模型在可扩展检测方面具有潜力，但分析也暴露了跨人口统计轴和多人口统计目标偏见的持续差距。

Conclusion: 需要更有效和可扩展的审计框架来解决多人口统计偏见检测的挑战。

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models
often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory
need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although
prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection
methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single
content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook
biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited
techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the
strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated
bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework
aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting
demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we
frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused
taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and
techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using
twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study
demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection.
However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and
multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and
scalable auditing frameworks.

Motivation: 当前医疗决策树构建方法依赖耗时费力的人工标注，需要自动化解决方案来支持临床决策系统。

Method: PI-LoRA（路径集成LoRA）是一种新颖的低秩自适应方法，集成梯度路径信息捕捉模块间协同效应，实现更有效的秩分配。

Result: 在医疗指南数据集上的实验表明，PI-LoRA在Text2MDT任务中显著优于现有参数高效微调方法，准确率更高且模型复杂度大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了最先进的结果，同时保持轻量级架构，特别适合计算资源有限的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Knowledge of the medical decision process, which can be modeled as medical
decision trees (MDTs), is critical to building clinical decision support
systems. However, current MDT construction methods rely heavily on
time-consuming and laborious manual annotation. To address this challenge, we
propose PI-LoRA (Path-Integrated LoRA), a novel low-rank adaptation method for
automatically extracting MDTs from clinical guidelines and textbooks. We
integrate gradient path information to capture synergistic effects between
different modules, enabling more effective and reliable rank allocation. This
framework ensures that the most critical modules receive appropriate rank
allocations while less important ones are pruned, resulting in a more efficient
and accurate model for extracting medical decision trees from clinical texts.
Extensive experiments on medical guideline datasets demonstrate that our
PI-LoRA method significantly outperforms existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches for the Text2MDT task, achieving better accuracy with
substantially reduced model complexity. The proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results while maintaining a lightweight architecture, making
it particularly suitable for clinical decision support systems where
computational resources may be limited.

Conclusion: 基于核心焦点引导的优化框架能有效提升医疗问题摘要任务性能，在焦点识别和幻觉缓解方面表现优异，为LLMs在医疗领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of online medical platforms, consumer health
questions (CHQs) are inefficient in diagnosis due to redundant information and
frequent non-professional terms. The medical question summary (MQS) task aims
to transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs),
but existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of
question focus and model hallucination. This paper explores the potential of
large language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning
is prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content. To this
end, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance. First,
a prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from
the CHQs that is faithful to the original text. Then, a fine-tuning dataset is
constructed in combination with the original CHQ-FAQ pairs to improve the
ability to identify the focus of the question. Finally, a multi-dimensional
quality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively
improve the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on two widely-adopted MQS datasets using three
established evaluation metrics. The proposed framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all measures, demonstrating a significant
boost in the model's ability to identify critical focus of questions and a
notable mitigation of hallucinations. The source codes are freely available at

Motivation: 现有单智能体方法在处理知识密集和复杂推理任务时存在上下文长度限制和噪声工具响应问题，而多智能体框架缺乏有效的强化学习后训练方法。

Method: MATPO通过角色特定提示在单个LLM实例中训练规划者和工作者角色，基于规划者和工作者轨迹的原则性信用分配机制。

Result: 在GAIA-text、WebWalkerQA和FRAMES数据集上，MATPO相比单智能体基线平均性能提升18.38%，对噪声工具输出表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在单个LLM中统一多个智能体角色是有效的，为稳定高效的多智能体强化学习训练提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on multi-turn tool-integrated
planning for knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks. Existing
implementations typically rely on a single agent, but they suffer from limited
context length and noisy tool responses. A natural solution is to adopt a
multi-agent framework with planner- and worker-agents to manage context.
However, no existing methods support effective reinforcement learning
post-training of tool-integrated multi-agent frameworks. To address this gap,
we propose Multi-Agent Tool-Integrated Policy Optimization (MATPO), which
enables distinct roles (planner and worker) to be trained within a single LLM
instance using role-specific prompts via reinforcement learning. MATPO is
derived from a principled credit assignment mechanism across planner and worker
rollouts. This design eliminates the need to deploy multiple LLMs, which would
be memory-intensive, while preserving the benefits of specialization.
Experiments on GAIA-text, WebWalkerQA, and FRAMES show that MATPO consistently
outperforms single-agent baselines by an average of 18.38% relative improvement
in performance and exhibits greater robustness to noisy tool outputs. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of unifying multiple agent roles within a
single LLM and provide practical insights for stable and efficient multi-agent
RL training.

Motivation: 解决PEFT方法如LoRA的适配参数依赖于基础模型且无法在不同骨干网络间转移的问题，同时避免知识蒸馏对训练数据的依赖和TransLoRA需要额外判别器模型的复杂性。

Method: 通过对比源模型有无LoRA的差异，捕捉任务相关信息，突出信息丰富的token，并选择性过滤合成数据。

Result: 在三个基准测试的多个转移设置中，该方法持续有效，整体平均性能提升4-8%。

Conclusion: TiTok框架能够有效实现LoRA移植，无需额外模型或开销，在各种转移设置中表现一致优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in real world scenarios, but
fine-tuning them comes with significant computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA mitigate these
costs, but the adapted parameters are dependent on the base model and cannot be
transferred across different backbones. One way to address this issue is
through knowledge distillation, but its effectiveness inherently depends on
training data. Recent work such as TransLoRA avoids this by generating
synthetic data, but this adds complexity because it requires training an
additional discriminator model. In this paper, we propose TiTok, a new
framework that enables effective LoRA Transplantation through Token-level
knowledge transfer. Specifically, TiTok captures task-relevant information
through a contrastive excess between a source model with and without LoRA. This
excess highlights informative tokens and enables selective filtering of
synthetic data, all without additional models or overhead. Through experiments
on three benchmarks across multiple transfer settings, our experiments show
that the proposed method is consistently effective, achieving average
performance gains of +4~8% compared to baselines overall.

Method: 使用并行多语言数据集分析专家路由模式，提出在推理时通过促进中间层任务专家激活来引导路由的方法。

Result: 发现中间层路由对齐与语言性能强相关，提出的干预方法在多个任务、模型和语言上获得1-2%的稳定性能提升。

Conclusion: MoE模型处理非英语文本的能力受限于其利用语言通用专家的能力，中间层路由对齐是提升多语言泛化的关键。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern
LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond
to multilingual data. In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using
parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise
phenomena. We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in
the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing
alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in
dense LLMs. In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a
model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed
to English in these layers. Extending beyond correlation, we explore
inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing
alignment. We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting
middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully
increases multilingual performance. These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent
across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given
that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained,
state-of-the-art LLMs. In comparison, interventions outside of the middle
layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance
degradation. Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs
process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the
model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM编辑JSON文档时需重新生成整个结构，计算效率低下，需要更高效的编辑方法。

Method: 提出JSON Whisperer框架，生成仅包含必要修改的差异补丁；引入EASE编码将数组转换为具有稳定键的字典，消除索引算术复杂性。

Result: 补丁生成结合EASE可将token使用量减少31%，编辑质量保持在完整重新生成的5%以内，在复杂指令和列表操作方面表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: JSON Whisperer通过差异补丁和EASE编码有效解决了LLM编辑JSON时的计算效率问题，为高效文档编辑提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can modify JSON documents through natural
language commands, but current approaches regenerate entire structures for each
edit, resulting in computational inefficiency. We present JSON Whisperer, a
framework that enables LLMs to generate RFC 6902 diff patches-expressing only
the necessary modifications-rather than complete documents. We identify two key
challenges in patch-based editing: (1) LLMs often miss related updates when
generating isolated patches, and (2) array manipulations require tracking index
shifts across operations, which LLMs handle poorly. To address these issues, we
introduce EASE (Explicitly Addressed Sequence Encoding), which transforms
arrays into dictionaries with stable keys, eliminating index arithmetic
complexities. Our evaluation shows that patch generation with EASE reduces
token usage by 31% while maintaining edit quality within 5% of full
regeneration with particular gains for complex instructions and list
manipulations. The dataset is available at:

Abstract: Dyslexia in adults remains an under-researched and under-served area,
particularly in non-English-speaking contexts, despite its significant impact
on personal and professional lives. This work addresses that gap by focusing on
Sinhala, a low-resource language with limited tools for linguistic
accessibility. We present an assistive system explicitly designed for
Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia. The system integrates Whisper for
speech-to-text conversion, SinBERT, an open-sourced fine-tuned BERT model
trained for Sinhala to identify common dyslexic errors, and a combined mT5 and
Mistral-based model to generate corrected text. Finally, the output is
converted back to speech using gTTS, creating a complete multimodal feedback
loop. Despite the challenges posed by limited Sinhala-language datasets, the
system achieves 0.66 transcription accuracy and 0.7 correction accuracy with
0.65 overall system accuracy. These results demonstrate both the feasibility
and effectiveness of the approach. Ultimately, this work highlights the

Conclusion: 两阶段检索架构能有效提升生物医学RAG性能，但性能依赖于检索器和重排序器的联合微调对齐。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually
grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by
the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically
misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated
response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced
language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is
often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to
address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval
architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for
efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model
for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our
retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical
context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from
PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of
the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points
compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical
RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on
the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong
baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this
performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns
the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the
performance.

Method: 基于Surian等人对儿童识别Grice准则违反的研究，创建了一个新基准，测试在少于1000万和1亿token上预训练的BabyLMs区分准则遵守和违反话语的能力。

Result: 在少于1亿token上训练的模型表现优于在少于1000万token上训练的模型，但仍未达到儿童和大型语言模型（在3万亿token上训练）的水平。数据量的适度增加改善了某些语用行为方面。

Conclusion: 虽然增加训练数据可以提升语言模型在语用推理方面的表现，但当前的小规模模型仍无法达到人类儿童或大型语言模型的语用理解能力。

Abstract: Implicit meanings are integral to human communication, making it essential
for language models to be capable of identifying and interpreting them. Grice
(1975) proposed a set of conversational maxims that guide cooperative dialogue,
noting that speakers may deliberately violate these principles to express
meanings beyond literal words, and that listeners, in turn, recognize such
violations to draw pragmatic inferences.
  Building on Surian et al. (1996)'s study of children's sensitivity to
violations of Gricean maxims, we introduce a novel benchmark to test whether
language models pretrained on less than 10M and less than 100M tokens can
distinguish maxim-adhering from maxim-violating utterances. We compare these
BabyLMs across five maxims and situate their performance relative to children
and a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on 3T tokens.
  We find that overall, models trained on less than 100M tokens outperform
those trained on less than 10M, yet fall short of child-level and LLM
competence. Our results suggest that modest data increases improve some aspects
of pragmatic behavior, leading to finer-grained differentiation between
pragmatic dimensions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对结合自注意力机制与结构化状态空间模型（如Mamba）的混合架构进行了系统评估，比较了层间（顺序）和层内（并行）融合策略，分析了影响混合模型效果的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然混合架构在建模质量和计算效率方面表现出色，但社区缺乏对混合策略的系统比较和有效性关键因素的分析。

Method: 通过层间（顺序）和层内（并行）融合策略构建混合架构，从语言建模性能、长上下文能力、扩展分析以及训练和推理效率等多个角度进行评估。

Result: 识别了每种混合策略最关键的计算原语特征，为两种混合模型提出了最优设计方案。

Conclusion: 全面的分析为开发混合语言模型提供了实用指导和宝贵见解，有助于优化架构配置。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models demonstrates that hybrid
architectures--combining self-attention mechanisms with structured state space
models like Mamba--can achieve a compelling balance between modeling quality
and computational efficiency, particularly for long-context tasks. While these
hybrid models show promising performance, systematic comparisons of
hybridization strategies and analyses on the key factors behind their
effectiveness have not been clearly shared to the community. In this work, we
present a holistic evaluation of hybrid architectures based on inter-layer
(sequential) or intra-layer (parallel) fusion. We evaluate these designs from a
variety of perspectives: language modeling performance, long-context
capabilities, scaling analysis, and training and inference efficiency. By
investigating the core characteristics of their computational primitive, we
identify the most critical elements for each hybridization strategy and further
propose optimal design recipes for both hybrid models. Our comprehensive
analysis provides practical guidance and valuable insights for developing
hybrid language models, facilitating the optimization of architectural
configurations.

### [261] [How I Built ASR for Endangered Languages with a Spoken Dictionary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04832)
*Christopher Bartley,Anton Ragni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索了为濒危语言构建自动语音识别(ASR)所需的最小数据量，发现仅需40分钟的短格式发音数据即可为曼克斯盖尔语和康沃尔语开发出可用的ASR系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界上近一半的语言濒临灭绝，标准ASR流水线需要语句级监督数据，但大多数濒危语言缺乏这种格式的数据。本文旨在降低构建濒危语言ASR系统的数据门槛。

Method: 使用短格式发音资源作为替代数据源，仅需40分钟此类数据，为曼克斯盖尔语和康沃尔语构建ASR系统。

Result: 为曼克斯盖尔语开发的ASR系统词错误率低于50%，证明该方法可行。在康沃尔语上的复现也获得成功。

Conclusion: 构建濒危语言ASR系统的数据门槛远低于预期，为无法满足传统数据要求的濒危语言社区带来了希望。

Abstract: Nearly half of the world's languages are endangered. Speech technologies such
as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are central to revival efforts, yet most
languages remain unsupported because standard pipelines expect utterance-level
supervised data. Speech data often exist for endangered languages but rarely
match these formats. Manx Gaelic ($\sim$2,200 speakers), for example, has had
transcribed speech since 1948, yet remains unsupported by modern systems. In
this paper, we explore how little data, and in what form, is needed to build
ASR for critically endangered languages. We show that a short-form
pronunciation resource is a viable alternative, and that 40 minutes of such
data produces usable ASR for Manx ($<$50\% WER). We replicate our approach,
applying it to Cornish ($\sim$600 speakers), another critically endangered
language. Results show that the barrier to entry, in quantity and form, is far
lower than previously thought, giving hope to endangered language communities
that cannot afford to meet the requirements arbitrarily imposed upon them.

*Yuto Nishida,Masaru Isonuma,Yusuke Oda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了LLM训练过程中下游任务性能的波动问题，并提出通过检查点平均和集成的方法来提升性能稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练时，下游任务性能存在显著波动，难以确定最佳检查点，需要解决这种不稳定性问题。

Method: 研究了两种后处理检查点集成方法：检查点平均和集成，通过聚合相邻检查点来减少性能波动。

Result: 经验证明和理论分析表明，这些方法能够在不改变训练过程的情况下提高下游性能的稳定性。

Conclusion: 检查点平均和集成是有效提升LLM训练稳定性的实用方法，无需修改训练流程。

Abstract: When training large language models (LLMs), it is common practice to track
downstream task performance throughout the training process and select the
checkpoint with the highest validation score. However, downstream metrics often
exhibit substantial fluctuations, making it difficult to identify the
checkpoint that truly represents the best-performing model. In this study, we
empirically analyze the stability of downstream task performance in an LLM
trained on diverse web-scale corpora. We find that task scores frequently
fluctuate throughout training, both at the aggregate and example levels. To
address this instability, we investigate two post-hoc checkpoint integration
methods: checkpoint averaging and ensemble, motivated by the hypothesis that
aggregating neighboring checkpoints can reduce performance volatility. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that these methods improve
downstream performance stability without requiring any changes to the training
procedure.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PsiloQA，一个大规模多语言数据集，包含14种语言的span级幻觉标注，用于评估幻觉检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉基准主要在序列级别且限于英语，缺乏细粒度的多语言监督，无法全面评估LLM的幻觉问题。

Method: 通过自动化三阶段流程构建数据集：使用GPT-4o从维基百科生成问答对，在无上下文设置下从不同LLM获取可能包含幻觉的答案，使用GPT-4o通过对比黄金答案和检索上下文自动标注幻觉span。

Result: 评估了多种幻觉检测方法，发现基于编码器的模型在所有语言中表现最强，PsiloQA展示了有效的跨语言泛化能力，并能稳健地迁移到其他基准。

Conclusion: PsiloQA数据集和结果推动了多语言环境下可扩展、细粒度幻觉检测的发展，且比人工标注数据集更具成本效益。

Abstract: Hallucination detection remains a fundamental challenge for the safe and
reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), especially in applications
requiring factual accuracy. Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at
the sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained,
multilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work,
we introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with
span-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through
an automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from
Wikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse
LLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans
using GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We
evaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including
uncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models --
and show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across
languages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual
generalization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all
while being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets.
Our dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained
hallucination detection in multilingual settings.

TL;DR: 提出Token Probability Deviation (TBD)方法来检测推理蒸馏过程中的数据污染问题，通过分析生成token的概率模式来区分已见过和未见过的数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理蒸馏虽然能有效提升大语言模型的推理能力，但可能导致评估数据污染，使蒸馏模型在基准测试中的性能被夸大。

Method: 利用蒸馏模型对已见过问题生成确定性高概率token，对未见过问题生成低概率token的特点，提出TBD方法量化生成token概率与高参考概率的偏差。

Result: 在S1数据集上取得AUC 0.918和TPR@1% FPR 0.470的优异检测性能。

Conclusion: TBD方法能有效检测推理蒸馏中的数据污染问题，为模型评估提供可靠的数据污染检测工具。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an efficient and powerful paradigm for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However,
reasoning distillation may inadvertently cause benchmark contamination, where
evaluation data included in distillation datasets can inflate performance
metrics of distilled models. In this work, we formally define the task of
distillation data detection, which is uniquely challenging due to the partial
availability of distillation data. Then, we propose a novel and effective
method Token Probability Deviation (TBD), which leverages the probability
patterns of the generated output tokens. Our method is motivated by the
analysis that distilled models tend to generate near-deterministic tokens for
seen questions, while producing more low-probability tokens for unseen
questions. Our key idea behind TBD is to quantify how far the generated tokens'
probabilities deviate from a high reference probability. In effect, our method
achieves competitive detection performance by producing lower scores for seen
questions than for unseen questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, achieving an AUC of 0.918 and a TPR@1% FPR of
0.470 on the S1 dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SocialHarmBench是一个包含585个提示的数据集，涵盖7个社会政治类别和34个国家，用于评估LLM在政治敏感情境中的漏洞。研究发现开源模型在有害合规方面存在高风险，特别是在历史修正主义、宣传和政治操纵等领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全基准很少测试LLM在政治操纵、宣传和虚假信息生成、监控和信息控制等领域的漏洞，而这些领域的失败可能产生直接的社会政治后果。

Method: 构建SocialHarmBench数据集，包含585个提示，涵盖7个社会政治类别和34个国家，评估LLM在政治敏感情境中的表现。

Result: 开源模型表现出高度脆弱性，Mistral-7B在历史修正主义、宣传和政治操纵等领域的攻击成功率高达97%-98%。LLM在21世纪和前20世纪情境以及拉丁美洲、美国和英国等地区最为脆弱。

Conclusion: 当前的安全措施无法推广到高风险的社会政治环境中，暴露了系统性偏见，并引发了对LLM在保护人权和民主价值观方面可靠性的担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contexts where
their failures can have direct sociopolitical consequences. Yet, existing
safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political
manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and
information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts
spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface
where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations
reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to
harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as
97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political
manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are
most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts,
and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA,
and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to
generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases
and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights
and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了NL2SQL任务中训练数据与目标查询的结构对齐问题，发现结构对齐度是预测微调成功的重要指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)是适配大语言模型的有效方法，但训练数据的变异性会阻碍模型的跨领域泛化能力。本文旨在研究NL2SQL任务中数据集对齐问题。

Method: 通过比较训练集、目标数据和模型预测中SQL结构特征的分布来估计对齐度，并在三个大型跨领域NL2SQL基准和多个模型家族上进行综合实验。

Result: 结构对齐是微调成功的强预测指标：当对齐度高时，SFT能显著提升准确率和SQL生成质量；当对齐度低时，改进很小或没有改进。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在NL2SQL任务中，对齐感知的数据选择对于有效微调和泛化的重要性。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is an effective method for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. However, variability in training
data can hinder a model's ability to generalize across domains. This paper
studies the problem of dataset alignment for Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL or
text to SQL), examining how well SFT training data matches the structural
characteristics of target queries and how this alignment impacts model
performance. We hypothesize that alignment can be accurately estimated by
comparing the distributions of structural SQL features across the training set,
target data, and the model's predictions prior to SFT. Through comprehensive
experiments on three large cross-domain NL2SQL benchmarks and multiple model
families, we show that structural alignment is a strong predictor of
fine-tuning success. When alignment is high, SFT yields substantial gains in
accuracy and SQL generation quality; when alignment is low, improvements are
marginal or absent. These findings highlight the importance of alignment-aware
data selection for effective fine-tuning and generalization in NL2SQL tasks.

*Amir Hameed Mir*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD)框架，通过分析transformer层间隐藏状态语义的动态变化来检测大语言模型幻觉，无需多次采样或外部验证，仅需单次前向传播即可实现高效检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生流畅但事实错误的陈述（幻觉现象），在高风险领域带来严重风险，需要开发高效的幻觉检测方法。

Method: 使用基于边界的对比学习，将隐藏激活与事实编码器生成的真实嵌入对齐，分析语义轨迹的分离：真实回答保持稳定对齐，而幻觉在深度上表现出明显的语义漂移。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和合成事实-幻觉数据集上评估，LSD达到F1分数0.92、AUROC 0.96和聚类准确率0.89，优于SelfCheckGPT和语义熵基线，且速度比基于采样的方法快5-20倍。

Conclusion: LSD提供了一种可扩展、模型无关的实时幻觉监测机制，并为大语言模型中事实一致性的几何结构提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect
statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in
high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric
framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of
hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that
rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates
intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based
contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth
embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in
semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while
hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the
TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an
F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming
SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single
forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based
methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a
scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and
provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large
language models.

TL;DR: 为纳瓦特尔语构建上下文无关语法，通过生成大量语法正确的句子来扩充语料库，用于训练FastText等算法，在语义任务上取得初步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳瓦特尔语作为π语言类型（数字资源稀缺语言），缺乏可用于机器学习的语料库，需要生成人工句子来扩充训练数据。

Method: 使用上下文无关语法生成大量语法正确的纳瓦特尔语句子，构建π-yalli语料库，并用其训练FastText算法。

Result: 通过语法生成的方法在句子级语义任务上相比某些大型语言模型取得了比较性改进，但改进幅度有限。

Conclusion: 需要构建更有效的纳瓦特尔语语法模型才能获得更显著的性能提升。

Abstract: In this article we introduce a context-free grammar (CFG) for the Nawatl
language. Nawatl (or Nahuatl) is an Amerindian language of the $\pi$-language
type, i.e. a language with few digital resources, in which the corpora
available for machine learning are virtually non-existent. The objective here
is to generate a significant number of grammatically correct artificial
sentences, in order to increase the corpora available for language model
training. We want to show that a grammar enables us significantly to expand a
corpus in Nawatl which we call $\pi$-\textsc{yalli}. The corpus, thus enriched,
enables us to train algorithms such as FastText and to evaluate them on
sentence-level semantic tasks. Preliminary results show that by using the
grammar, comparative improvements are achieved over some LLMs. However, it is
observed that to achieve more significant improvement, grammars that model the
Nawatl language even more effectively are required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自然语言提示中礼貌程度和语气对大型语言模型性能的影响，特别是多选问题上的准确性。

Method: 创建50个基础问题，每个问题改写为5种语气变体（非常礼貌、礼貌、中性、粗鲁、非常粗鲁），使用ChatGPT 4o评估响应，并应用配对样本t检验分析统计显著性。

Result: 不礼貌提示持续优于礼貌提示，准确率分别为：非常礼貌80.8%、礼貌82.0%、中性83.2%、粗鲁84.0%、非常粗鲁84.8%。

Conclusion: 新LLMs对语气变化的响应可能与早期研究不同，强调研究提示语用方面的重要性，并引发关于人机交互社会维度的更广泛问题。

Abstract: The wording of natural language prompts has been shown to influence the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the role of politeness and
tone remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying levels of
prompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We
created a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and
history, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral,
Rude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we
evaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests
to assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts
consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for
Very Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from
earlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that
newer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight
the importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader
questions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: AWARE框架通过提升transformer模型在领域、上下文和类别重叠三个维度的感知能力，显著提升了从学生反思中识别文化资本主题的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生反思中的文化资本主题（如志向目标、家庭支持）通常以叙述方式呈现而非直接关键词，标准NLP模型因缺乏领域特定语言和上下文意识而难以检测。

Method: 提出AWARE框架，包含三个核心组件：领域感知（适应学生反思的语言风格）、上下文感知（生成考虑全文背景的句子嵌入）、类别重叠感知（使用多标签策略识别句子中并存的主题）。

Result: AWARE在Macro-F1上比强基线提升2.1个百分点，在所有主题上均显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为任何依赖叙述上下文的文本分类任务提供了稳健且可推广的方法论。

Abstract: Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer
valuable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in
classrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are
often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This
makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences
in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard
models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the
domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address
this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a
transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core
components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the
linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating
sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class
Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the
coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the
model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a
strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable
improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable
methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the
context of the narrative.

Method: 采用参数高效微调技术（LoRA和QLoRA），在公开可用的医学推理数据集上对LLaMA-3.2-3B模型进行适配，实现在受限GPU和内存环境下的高效微调。

Result: 模型在医学推理一致性和事实准确性方面得到提升，同时内存使用量相比标准全微调减少高达60%，在医学问答任务中保持了强大的推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了在低资源研究环境中部署LLM的实用策略，为平衡效率和领域专业化提供了见解，特别适用于医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA have demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities but require significant computational resources
for fine-tuning. This paper presents a resource-efficient fine-tuning approach
for LLaMA-3.2-3B to enhance medical chain-of-thought reasoning while operating
under constrained GPU and memory settings. Using parameter-efficient tuning
techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, we adapt the base model on publicly
available medical reasoning datasets. The model achieves improved reasoning
coherence and factual accuracy while reducing memory usage by up to 60%
compared to standard full fine-tuning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
that lightweight adaptations can retain strong reasoning capability in medical
question-answering tasks. This work highlights practical strategies for
deploying LLMs in low-resource research environments and provides insights into
balancing efficiency and domain specialization for medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用Unicode变体选择器实现不可感知越狱攻击的方法，通过在恶意问题后附加不可见的变体选择器，使提示在视觉上与原始恶意问题相同，但tokenization被秘密改变，从而诱导有害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模态的越狱攻击通常依赖于不可感知的对抗扰动，而文本模态的攻击通常需要可见修改。本文旨在探索文本模态中不可感知的越狱攻击可能性。

Method: 提出了一种链式搜索流水线来生成对抗性后缀，利用Unicode变体选择器这类字符，使恶意问题在屏幕上看起来与原始问题完全相同，但tokenization被秘密改变。

Result: 实验表明，这种不可感知的越狱攻击对四个对齐的LLM实现了高攻击成功率，并能推广到提示注入攻击，且不会在书面提示中产生任何可见修改。

Conclusion: 通过利用Unicode变体选择器，可以实现文本模态中完全不可感知的越狱攻击，这揭示了当前LLM安全机制中的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Jailbreaking attacks on the vision modality typically rely on imperceptible
adversarial perturbations, whereas attacks on the textual modality are
generally assumed to require visible modifications (e.g., non-semantic
suffixes). In this paper, we introduce imperceptible jailbreaks that exploit a
class of Unicode characters called variation selectors. By appending invisible
variation selectors to malicious questions, the jailbreak prompts appear
visually identical to original malicious questions on screen, while their
tokenization is "secretly" altered. We propose a chain-of-search pipeline to
generate such adversarial suffixes to induce harmful responses. Our experiments
show that our imperceptible jailbreaks achieve high attack success rates
against four aligned LLMs and generalize to prompt injection attacks, all
without producing any visible modifications in the written prompt. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/imperceptible-jailbreaks.

words. We explain how to construct these corpora, so that our methodology can
be replicated for other dialects. Our experiments with 94 LLM demonstrate that
our regional idiom benchmarks are a reliable tool for measuring a model's

### [274] [Guided Query Refinement: Multimodal Hybrid Retrieval with Test-Time Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05038)
*Omri Uzan,Asaf Yehudai,Roi pony,Eyal Shnarch,Ariel Gera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GQR方法，通过轻量级文本检索器增强视觉中心模型，在视觉文档检索中实现性能与效率的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态检索模型存在表示规模过大、部署困难的问题，且纯视觉方法受限于模态差距。传统混合检索方法未能充分利用模型表示空间的丰富交互

Method: 提出引导查询优化(GQR)，在测试时使用互补检索器的分数来优化主检索器的查询嵌入

Result: GQR使视觉中心模型能够匹配更大表示模型的性能，同时速度提升14倍，内存需求减少54倍

Conclusion: GQR有效推动了多模态检索在性能与效率方面的帕累托前沿

Abstract: Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval,
matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on
this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document
representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in
real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be
constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern
vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the
paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text
retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods,
which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the
rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we
introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method
that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a
complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual
document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric
models to match the performance of models with significantly larger
representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory.
Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for
performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at

Motivation: 为了解决法语自然语言理解评估不够全面的问题，需要创建一个涵盖广泛NLU能力的基准测试，特别关注与法语语言相关的语言现象。

Method: 引入了COLE基准测试，包含23个多样化任务，涵盖情感分析、复述检测、语法判断和推理等能力，并对94个大语言模型进行了基准测试。

Abstract: To address the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of French Natural
Language Understanding (NLU), we introduce COLE, a new benchmark composed of 23
diverse task covering a broad range of NLU capabilities, including sentiment
analysis, paraphrase detection, grammatical judgment, and reasoning, with a

benchmark 94 large language models (LLM), providing an extensive analysis of
the current state of French NLU. Our results highlight a significant
performance gap between closed- and open-weights models and identify key
challenging frontiers for current LLMs, such as zero-shot extractive
question-answering (QA), fine-grained word sense disambiguation, and
understanding of regional language variations. We release COLE as a public

*Dachuan Shi,Abedelkadir Asi,Keying Li,Xiangchi Yuan,Leyan Pan,Wenke Lee,Wen Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwiReasoning是一个无需训练的LLM推理框架，通过动态切换显式和潜在推理来平衡探索与利用，提高准确性和令牌效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决潜在推理面临的两个挑战：1) 纯粹潜在推理会扩散概率质量，引入噪声，阻碍收敛到高置信度解；2) 过度思考问题持续存在，浪费令牌并降低效率。

Method: SwiReasoning框架包含两个关键创新：1) 基于下一个令牌分布的熵趋势估计块级置信度，动态切换显式和潜在推理；2) 限制思维块切换的最大次数来抑制过度思考。

Result: 在广泛使用的数学和STEM基准测试中，SwiReasoning将不同模型家族和规模的推理LLM的平均准确率提高了1.5%-2.8%。在受限预算下，平均令牌效率提高了56%-79%，预算越紧增益越大。

Conclusion: SwiReasoning通过动态推理切换机制有效解决了潜在推理的收敛问题和过度思考问题，在提高准确性的同时显著提升了令牌效率。

Abstract: Recent work shows that, beyond discrete reasoning through explicit
chain-of-thought steps, which are limited by the boundaries of natural
languages, large language models (LLMs) can also reason continuously in latent
space, allowing richer information per step and thereby improving token
efficiency. Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,
especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the
search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses
probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single
high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking
persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.
To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework
for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning
dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by
block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token
distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely
convergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,
SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying
problem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,
SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across
reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under
constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%,
with larger gains as budgets tighten.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SLM-MUX的三阶段方法，用于有效协调多个小型语言模型(SLMs)，通过模型选择搜索和测试时缩放优化策略，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有编排方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着小型语言模型数量的快速增长，虽然它们无法达到最先进的精度，但在特定任务上表现出色且更高效。现有编排方法主要针对前沿模型，在SLMs上表现不佳，因此需要专门针对SLMs的编排方法。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1) SLM-MUX多模型架构协调多个SLMs；2) 模型选择搜索从候选池中识别最具互补性的SLMs；3) 针对SLM-MUX的测试时缩放优化策略。

Result: 在MATH上提升13.4%，GPQA上提升8.8%，GSM8K上提升7.0%。仅使用两个SLMs，SLM-MUX在GPQA和GSM8K上超越Qwen 2.5 72B，在MATH上与之相当。

Conclusion: 通过所提出的方法，小型语言模型可以被有效编排成更准确和高效的系统，证明了SLMs编排的可行性和优势。

Abstract: With the rapid development of language models, the number of small language
models (SLMs) has grown significantly. Although they do not achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy, they are more efficient and often excel at specific
tasks. This raises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a
system where each contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any
individual model? Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted
frontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To
address this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.
First, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively
coordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization
strategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary
SLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our
approach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,
our approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%
on GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and
GSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical
analyses to substantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we
demonstrate that SLMs can be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and
efficient systems through the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式AI在教育中受限于LLM教学能力不足的问题，特别是缺乏真实学生学习数据，以及提示工程在编码复杂教学策略方面的局限性。

Method: 使用10万小时真实学生-导师对话数据，通过参数高效微调开发真实学生模型，生成高保真合成学生-导师对话，并提出基于合成对话的多轮评估协议。

Result: 微调显著改善对话和教学表现：学生发言时间翻倍、提问风格改善、对话轮次增加50%、教学个性化程度提高。

Conclusion: 基于真实学习数据的微调能有效提升LLM的教学对话能力，为教育AI发展提供新途径。

Abstract: The promise of generative AI to revolutionize education is constrained by the
pedagogical limits of large language models (LLMs). A major issue is the lack
of access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual
students. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of
prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language
is inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM
optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of
state-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000
hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by
Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy.
We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model
that enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues.
Building on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol
that leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and
reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our
evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data
significantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling
student talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by
50%, and greater personalization of instruction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tolerator是一种无需训练的扩散大语言模型解码策略，通过两阶段过程（序列填充和迭代精炼）实现令牌级交叉验证，解决了传统扩散解码中令牌一旦接受就无法修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有并行解码和双向上下文建模的优势，但其传统解码策略存在关键限制：一旦令牌被接受，后续步骤中无法再修改，导致早期错误持续影响最终输出质量。

Method: 提出Tolerator解码策略，包含两个阶段：(i)序列填充阶段；(ii)迭代精炼阶段，通过重新掩码和解码令牌子集，同时将剩余令牌作为上下文，使已接受的令牌能够被重新考虑和修正。

Result: 在涵盖语言理解、代码生成和数学推理的五个标准基准测试中，Tolerator在相同计算预算下相比基线方法实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: 解码算法对于充分发挥扩散大语言模型的潜力至关重要，Tolerator通过令牌级交叉验证机制显著提升了扩散解码的可靠性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering advantages such as
accelerated parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling. However, the
vanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation:
once a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a
result, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate
predictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose
Tolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding
strategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike
existing methods that follow a single progressive unmasking procedure,
Tolerator introduces a two-stage process: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii)
iterative refinement by remasking and decoding a subset of tokens while
treating the remaining as context. This design enables previously accepted
tokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more
reliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard
benchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics.
Experiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the
baselines under the same computational budget. These findings suggest that
decoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of diffusion
large language models. Code and data are publicly available.

Method: 使用RGB图像表示法构建平面连杆机构数据集，采用共享潜在空间的变分自编码器，通过轨迹点绘制速度的颜色梯度编码速度信息，支持基于轨迹形状和速度分布的约束合成。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的数据集上验证了方法的有效性：标准四杆机构集、四杆和曲柄滑块混合集、包含多环机构的复杂集。初步结果表明图像表示法在生成式机械设计中具有良好效果。

Conclusion: 基于图像的表示法为生成式机械设计提供了有效框架，能够在统一图像生成框架中表示和合成具有转动副、移动副以及潜在凸轮和齿轮的机构。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the problem of kinematic synthesis for planar
linkages as a cross-domain image generation task. We develop a planar linkages
dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from
simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar
linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE)
is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for
synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding
the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same
architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory
shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of
increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar
and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms.
Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based
representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with
revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be
represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework.

TL;DR: Universal Beta Splatting (UBS) 是一个统一框架，将3D高斯泼溅推广到N维各向异性Beta核，用于显式辐射场渲染。它使用可控的Beta核替代固定高斯基元，在单一表示中建模空间、角度和时间维度的依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法使用固定高斯基元，无法有效建模复杂的光传输效应、各向异性视角相关外观和场景动态。需要开发一个统一框架来处理这些多维依赖关系。

Method: 提出使用N维各向异性Beta核作为通用基元，在单一表示中统一建模空间、角度和时间维度。该方法保持向后兼容性，高斯泼溅是其特例。通过CUDA加速实现实时渲染。

Result: UBS在静态、视角相关和动态基准测试中一致优于现有方法。学习到的Beta参数能够自然分解场景属性为可解释的组件：空间（表面vs纹理）、角度（漫反射vs镜面反射）和时间（静态vs动态）。

Conclusion: Beta核被确立为辐射场渲染的可扩展通用基元，能够捕获复杂光传输效应，处理各向异性外观，建模场景动态，无需辅助网络或特定颜色编码。

Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that
generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for
explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta
kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and
temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach
captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent
appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or
specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating
to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and
lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene
properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface
vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs.
dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering
while consistently outperforming existing methods across static,
view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable
universal primitive for radiance field rendering. Our project website is

Motivation: 旨在证明高质量文本到图像生成可以在没有中心协调基础设施的情况下实现，消除对专用GPU集群的需求。

Method: 采用分布式扩散训练框架，包含8个专家扩散模型，在完全隔离的环境中训练，无需梯度、参数或中间激活同步。通过数据语义聚类分区，每个专家独立优化其子集，轻量级transformer路由器在推理时动态选择专家。

Conclusion: 去中心化训练方法能够有效替代中心化协调训练，为大规模扩散模型训练提供了更灵活和资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained
entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that
high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally
coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use.
Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from
scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters
each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or
intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized
gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically
coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while
collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer
router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving
generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating
synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized
interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized
training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster
requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using
14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior
decentralized baseline.

TL;DR: Neon是一种新的学习方法，通过负向外推从自训练中解决模型自噬障碍，显著提升生成模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成AI模型扩展受限于高质量训练数据的稀缺性，使用未验证的合成数据进行微调会导致模型自噬障碍，造成样本质量和多样性的快速退化。

Method: Neon首先在自合成的数据上微调基础模型，然后反其道而行之，反转梯度更新以从退化的权重中进行负向外推。该方法利用推理采样器在高概率区域产生的可预测反对齐特性进行修正。

Result: Neon在多种架构和数据集上表现出普适性，在ImageNet 256x256上将xAR-L模型提升到FID 1.02的新SOTA，仅需0.36%的额外训练计算。

Conclusion: Neon通过负向外推有效解决了自训练导致的模型退化问题，能够更好地对齐真实数据分布，且实现简单、计算效率高。

Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality
training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using
(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the
purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,
however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder
(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality
and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation
frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from
self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,
Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,
counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the
degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers
that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between
the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation
corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is
remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new
real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically
uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's
universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,
autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,
CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the
xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional
training compute. Code is available at https://github.com/SinaAlemohammad/Neon

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在强文本引导下输出多样性有限，现有方法对超参数敏感且效果有限。

Method: 开发在Tweedie数据空间定义的对比损失，优化一批噪声潜在变量，通过对比优化使批次内实例相互排斥以最大化多样性，同时锚定参考样本以保持保真度。

Result: 在多个T2I骨干模型上的实验表明，该方法实现了更优的质量-多样性帕累托前沿，且对超参数选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对比噪声优化是一种简单有效的预处理方法，能从独特角度解决文本到图像生成的多样性问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance
in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference.
However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited
diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text
guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text
conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or
remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses
the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that
adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote
diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the
Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive
optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while
keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further
provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to
substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I
backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity
Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单高效的数据增强流程，通过在基于神经SDF的CAD部件隐式重建网络上添加部件分割头，并使用PartField生成的监督进行训练。该方法能够处理任意数量部件的网格，并生成几何对齐的标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常受限于固定的分类体系，无法处理具有任意数量部件的CAD网格。本文旨在开发一种不依赖预定义分类或精确调色板匹配的方法，实现语义结构化的CAD网格。

Method: 在Flat-CAD SDF主干网络上附加轻量级分割头，使用PartField生成的监督进行训练。该方法能够处理任意部件数量的网格，并在单次前向传播中生成几何对齐的连贯标签。

Result: 在ABC数据集上评估显示，该方法在重建指标（CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC）和分割指标（mIoU, Accuracy）上表现优异。即使在薄壁或复杂几何的重建质量下降时，分割仍然保持准确和标签一致性，通常能保持正确的部件数量。

Conclusion: 该方法为语义结构化的CAD网格提供了一条实用路径，无需精心策划的分类体系或精确的调色板匹配。主要局限在于边界精度，部分原因是基于面的监督，未来可探索边界感知训练和更高分辨率标签。

Abstract: We propose a simple, data-efficient pipeline that augments an implicit
reconstruction network based on neural SDF-based CAD parts with a
part-segmentation head trained under PartField-generated supervision. Unlike
methods tied to fixed taxonomies, our model accepts meshes with any number of
parts and produces coherent, geometry-aligned labels in a single pass. We
evaluate on randomly sampled CAD meshes from the ABC dataset with intentionally
varied part cardinalities, including over-segmented shapes, and report strong
performance across reconstruction (CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC) and segmentation
(mIoU, Accuracy), together with a new Segmentation Consistency metric that
captures local label smoothness. We attach a lightweight segmentation head to
the Flat-CAD SDF trunk; on a paired evaluation it does not alter reconstruction
while providing accurate part labels for meshes with any number of parts. Even
under degraded reconstructions on thin or intricate geometries, segmentation
remains accurate and label-coherent, often preserving the correct part count.
Our approach therefore offers a practical route to semantically structured CAD
meshes without requiring curated taxonomies or exact palette matches. We
discuss limitations in boundary precision, partly due to per-face supervision,
and outline paths toward boundary-aware training and higher resolution labels.

Result: 该方法在4K分辨率下运行时间小于1毫秒，能够显著减小每帧需要渲染的中心凹像素区域，同时允许更高的中心凹化水平。

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且易于集成到实时VR和AR中心凹渲染系统中，通过时间复用像素样本实现了渲染成本降低和感知质量提升的平衡。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal sensitivity to high frequency information declines with
increased peripheral eccentricity. Foveated rendering exploits this by
decreasing the spatial resolution of rendered images in peripheral vision,
reducing the rendering cost by omitting high frequency details. As foveation
levels increase, the rendering quality is reduced, and traditional foveated
rendering systems tend not to preserve samples that were previously rendered at
high spatial resolution in previous frames. Additionally, prior research has
shown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location
rather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes
perform small microsaccades around a fixation point. This creates an
opportunity for sampling from temporally neighbouring frames with differing
foveal locations to reduce the required rendered size of the foveal region
while achieving a higher perceived image quality. We further observe that the
temporal presentation of pixels frame-to-frame can be viewed as a data stream,
presenting a random sampling problem. Following this intuition, we propose a
Weighted Reservoir Sampling technique to efficiently maintain a reservoir of
the perceptually relevant high quality pixel samples from previous frames and
incorporate them into the computation of the current frame. This allows the
renderer to render a smaller region of foveal pixels per frame by temporally
reusing pixel samples that are still relevant to reconstruct a higher perceived
image quality, while allowing for higher levels of foveation. Our method
operates on the output of foveated rendering, and runs in under 1\,ms at 4K
resolution, making it highly efficient and integrable with real-time VR and AR
foveated rendering systems.

TL;DR: 3Dify是一个基于大语言模型的程序化3D图形生成框架，允许用户通过自然语言指令生成3D内容，支持MCP协议和RAG技术，并能自动化DCC工具操作和GUI界面操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在简化3D图形内容的创建过程，让用户无需专业3D建模技能即可通过自然语言生成高质量的3D内容，同时降低使用成本和提升生成质量。

Method: 基于Dify平台构建，采用MCP协议自动化DCC工具操作，使用CUA方法处理不支持MCP的GUI界面，通过用户反馈选择优化图像生成，支持本地LLM部署以减少API调用成本。

Result: 开发了一个完整的3D-CG生成框架，能够根据自然语言指令生成3D内容，支持多种DCC工具自动化操作，并通过用户反馈机制持续改进生成质量。

Conclusion: 3Dify框架成功实现了通过自然语言生成3D内容的目标，为普通用户提供了便捷的3D创作工具，同时通过本地部署和反馈机制优化了使用体验和成本效益。

Abstract: This paper proposes "3Dify," a procedural 3D computer graphics (3D-CG)
generation framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework
enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language
instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI
application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related
technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation
of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not
support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent
(CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover,
to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by
selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns
variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent
generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed
LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time
and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own
computational resources.

TL;DR: C3Editor是一个可控且一致的基于2D提升的3D编辑框架，通过选择性建立视图一致的2D编辑模型来解决现有方法的多视图不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于2D提升的3D编辑方法经常遇到不一致性问题，主要源于缺乏视图一致的2D编辑模型以及难以确保跨多个视图的一致编辑。

Method: 方法包括：1）控制选择GT视图及其编辑图像作为优化目标；2）在GT视图和多个视图中微调2D编辑模型以对齐GT编辑图像；3）引入单独的LoRA模块分别处理GT视图拟合和多视图一致性需求。

Result: 该方法在定性和定量评估中都优于现有的基于2D提升的方法，提供了更一致和可控的2D和3D编辑结果。

Conclusion: C3Editor通过选择性建立视图一致的2D编辑模型，有效解决了3D编辑中的一致性问题，实现了更优的编辑效果。

Abstract: Existing 2D-lifting-based 3D editing methods often encounter challenges
related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing
models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views.
To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent
2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and
a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a
view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The
process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and
its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for
user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the
GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while
ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view
fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for
targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D
and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming
them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Motivation: 为了解决双人对话中非语言行为生成的挑战，需要创建能够产生真实、同步且上下文适当的伴随语音手势和动作的系统。

Method: 开发了基于大语言模型的智能体系统来控制对话流程和确定交互行为，并提出基于自回归扩散模型的双人手势生成模型，从语音信号合成协调运动。

Result: 用户研究和定量评估表明，该模型显著提高了双人交互质量，产生了自然、同步的非语言行为。

Conclusion: Social Agent框架通过结合智能体系统和手势生成模型，成功实现了动态响应的双人交互，为非语言行为合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Social Agent, a novel framework for synthesizing realistic and
contextually appropriate co-speech nonverbal behaviors in dyadic conversations.
In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language
Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate
interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel
dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion
model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of
the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture
generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion
levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of
interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop
that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants.
User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly
improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized
nonverbal behaviors.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation technology holds potential to transform
multiple domains such as education, marketing, entertainment, and assistive
technologies for individuals with visual or reading comprehension challenges,
by creating coherent visual content from natural language prompts. From its
inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based
models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges
persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency.
Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of
text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and
VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these
models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why
shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges
in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the
datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated
on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training
such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware
specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs,
and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics
commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across
standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and
the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation
strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open
challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a
perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V
research and applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过文本嵌入的token级操作实现解耦和连续图像编辑的方法，使用稀疏自编码器识别语义隔离的编辑方向，无需修改扩散过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型仅通过文本提示无法提供足够的编辑控制，特别需要解耦编辑（改变一个属性不影响其他属性）和连续控制（平滑调整编辑强度）的能力。

Method: 通过操作文本嵌入沿精心选择的编辑方向来控制目标属性的强度，使用稀疏自编码器识别语义隔离的维度，直接在文本嵌入层面操作而不修改扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够在不同属性和领域中实现直观高效的连续控制操作。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种模型无关的解决方案，能够实现解耦和连续的图像编辑控制，适用于各种图像合成框架。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern
image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the
editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement,
where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and
continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We
introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level
manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the
embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the
target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our
method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion
process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image
synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient
manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.

Abstract: Treating human motion and camera trajectory generation separately overlooks a
core principle of cinematography: the tight interplay between actor performance
and camera work in the screen space. In this paper, we are the first to cast
this task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent
on-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked,
modalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple,
model-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary
modality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the
camera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between
modalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint
distribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent
space, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera
latents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which
exploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing
modality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a
human-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality
human motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures
show the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame
coherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment
for both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically
meaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task. Code,
models and data are available in our

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了10个当代大语言模型的自我识别能力，发现模型普遍无法识别自己生成的文本，性能仅略高于随机猜测，且存在对GPT和Claude家族的强烈偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对AI系统是否具备自我识别能力存在争议，本研究旨在建立系统评估框架，验证大语言模型识别自身生成文本的能力，这对AI安全和心理分析具有重要意义。

Method: 通过两个任务评估模型：二元自我识别（判断文本是否为自己生成）和精确模型预测（识别文本来源模型），并分析模型对自身和其他模型存在的认知及其推理过程。

Result: 10个模型中只有4个能正确识别自己生成的文本，整体性能接近随机水平。模型表现出对GPT和Claude家族的强烈偏见，并显示出对模型层次结构的认知偏差。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在自我识别方面存在系统性失败，这对AI安全构成挑战。需要开发适当的AI自我意识，并考虑模型偏见对评估结果的影响。

Abstract: Self-recognition is a crucial metacognitive capability for AI systems,
relevant not only for psychological analysis but also for safety, particularly
in evaluative scenarios. Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether
models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al.,
2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily
applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger
language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from
other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model
prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent
failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as
generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally,
models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also
provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others'
existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition.
We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and
other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to
assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often
associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the
implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop
appropriate AI self-awareness.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn chatbot interactions remains
challenging, as most existing methods assess interactions at the turn level
without addressing whether a user's overarching goal was fulfilled. A ``goal''
here refers to an information need or task, such as asking for policy
information or applying for leave. We propose a comprehensive framework for
goal-oriented evaluation of multi-agent systems (MAS), introducing the
\textbf{Goal Success Rate (GSR)} to measure the percentage of fulfilled goals,
and a \textbf{Root Cause of Failure (RCOF)} taxonomy to identify reasons for
failure in multi-agent chatbots. Our method segments conversations by user
goals and evaluates success using all relevant turns. We present a model-based
evaluation system combining teacher LLMs, where domain experts define goals,
set quality standards serving as a guidance for the LLMs. The LLMs use
``thinking tokens'' to produce interpretable rationales, enabling
\textit{explainable}, \textit{data-efficient} evaluations. In an enterprise
setting, we apply our framework to evaluate AIDA, a zero-to-one employee
conversational agent system built as a ground-up multi-agent conversational
agent, and observe GSR improvement from 63\% to 79\% over six months since its
inception. Our framework is generic and offers actionable insights through a
detailed defect taxonomy based on analysis of failure points in multi-agent
chatbots, diagnosing overall success, identifying key failure modes, and
informing system improvements.

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory
modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic
physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models
(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and
generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world
models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual
reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,
control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We
investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation
models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of
MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning
skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal
reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand
deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore
generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and
video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable
generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,
and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring
consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further
extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive,
editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

Abstract: We present a gamified explainable AI (XAI) system for ethically aware
consumer decision-making in the coffee domain. Each session comprises six
rounds with three options per round. Two symbolic engines provide real-time
reasons: a Kantian module flags rule violations (e.g., child labor,
deforestation risk without shade certification, opaque supply chains, unsafe
decaf), and a utilitarian module scores options via multi-criteria aggregation
over normalized attributes (price, carbon, water, transparency, farmer income
share, taste/freshness, packaging, convenience). A meta-explainer with a regret
bound (0.2) highlights Kantian--utilitarian (mis)alignment and switches to a
deontically clean, near-parity option when welfare loss is small. We release a
structured configuration (attribute schema, certification map, weights, rule
set), a policy trace for auditability, and an interactive UI.

Motivation: 现有创造力评估框架碎片化，缺乏理论依据，需要构建一个基于社会科学理论的统一评估基准。

Method: 引入C^2-Eval基准，区分收敛性创造力和发散性创造力，使用有用性、原创性和惊喜度三个细粒度标准进行评估。

Result: 通过对领先专有和开源模型的广泛实验，分析了它们在创造力能力上的权衡，揭示了当前基础模型在追求创造性机器思维方面的优势和挑战。

Conclusion: C^2-Eval是检验创造性AI发展演进的有效工具，能够全面评估基础模型的创造力表现。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of foundation models (FMs) has expanded their capabilities
far beyond conventional tasks. Creativity, long regarded as a hallmark of human
intelligence and a driver of innovation, is now increasingly recognized as a
critical dimension of machine intelligence in the era of generative FMs,
complementing traditional measures of accuracy. However, existing evaluation
frameworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not
firmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce
C^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.
C^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:
convergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code
generation), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,
storytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived
from social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise
(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source
models, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities. Our results
highlight both the strengths and challenges of current FMs in pursuing a
creative machine mind, showing that C^2-Eval is an effective lens for examining
the evolving landscape of creative AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
AI agents that automate multiple stages of the data science workflow by
integrating planning, tool use, and multimodal reasoning across text, code,

lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and
mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science
process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and
visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection,
interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to
lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design
dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool
orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and
governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis
of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and
review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies
three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization,
and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and
monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved
challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude
by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability,
governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research
directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency,
transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents.

*Dmitrii Troitskii,Koyena Pal,Chris Wendler,Callum Stuart McDougall,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现推理模型中的等待标记（wait tokens）是复杂推理行为的关键信号，通过分析模型潜在特征可以识别和调控这些推理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么模型会决定采用等待标记这种特定的推理方式，以及这些行为背后的机制，从而深入理解推理模型的有效性。

Method: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B及其基础版本的多个层训练交叉编码器，引入潜在归因技术，识别与等待标记概率相关的特征集。

Result: 识别出一小部分与促进/抑制等待标记概率相关的特征，这些特征确实与推理过程相关，并产生不同类型的推理模式。

Conclusion: 模型潜在特征包含调控后续推理过程的相关信息，等待标记是复杂推理行为的重要信号，可以揭示推理模型的工作机制。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that a significant driver of performance in reasoning
models is their ability to reason and self-correct. A distinctive marker in
these reasoning traces is the token wait, which often signals reasoning
behavior such as backtracking. Despite being such a complex behavior, little is
understood of exactly why models do or do not decide to reason in this
particular manner, which limits our understanding of what makes a reasoning
model so effective. In this work, we address the question whether model's
latents preceding wait tokens contain relevant information for modulating the
subsequent reasoning process. We train crosscoders at multiple layers of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and its base version, and introduce a latent
attribution technique in the crosscoder setting. We locate a small set of
features relevant for promoting/suppressing wait tokens' probabilities.
Finally, through a targeted series of experiments analyzing max activating
examples and causal interventions, we show that many of our identified features
indeed are relevant for the reasoning process and give rise to different types
of reasoning patterns such as restarting from the beginning, recalling prior
knowledge, expressing uncertainty, and double-checking.

TL;DR: 提出MENTOR框架，在RLVR中仅在关键决策点提供专家指导，实现有效且多样化的探索，提升模型推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖基础模型能力，需要高质量探索（有效性和多样性），但现有方法通过模仿专家轨迹只提升有效性而忽视多样性

Method: MENTOR框架：混合策略专家导航，在关键决策点提供专家指导，进行令牌级优化推理

Result: 实验表明MENTOR能捕捉专家策略本质而非表面模仿，实现高质量探索和更优整体性能

Conclusion: 在关键决策点提供专家指导比完整轨迹模仿更有效，MENTOR框架能提升RLVR的探索质量和推理性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a widely
adopted technique for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RLVR strongly depends on the capability
of base models. This issue arises because it requires the model to have
sufficient capability to perform high-quality exploration, which involves both
effectiveness and diversity. Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue
by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect
diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide
guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning
path. Based on this insight, we propose MENTOR: Mixed-policy Expert Navigation
for Token-level Optimization of Reasoning, a framework that provides expert
guidance only at critical decision points to perform effective and diverse
exploration in RLVR. Extensive experiments show that MENTOR enables models
capture the essence of expert strategies rather than surface imitation, thereby
performing high-quality exploration and achieving superior overall performance.

*Mohsen Hariri,Amirhossein Samandar,Michael Hinczewski,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个贝叶斯评估框架替代Pass@k，通过后验概率估计和可信区间提供更稳定的模型排名和透明的决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pass@k在有限试验次数和计算资源受限时会产生不稳定和误导性的排名结果，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用狄利克雷先验对评估结果进行建模，提供后验均值和不确定性的闭式表达式，支持加权评分标准和先验证据的使用。

Result: 在模拟实验和AIME'24/'25、HMMT'25、BrUMO'25等数据集上，贝叶斯方法比Pass@k及其变体收敛更快、排名更稳定，能在更少样本下实现可靠比较。

Conclusion: 建议用基于后验概率的计算高效协议替代Pass@k，统一二元和非二元评估，同时明确表达不确定性。

Abstract: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often
yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials
(samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled
Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over
$N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success
probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent
decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical
(not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the
posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of
prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the
Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$),
explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty.
Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on
AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster
convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants,
enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework
clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping
credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded,
rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$
for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient
protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty
explicit. Code is available at https://mohsenhariri.github.io/bayes-kit

TL;DR: 该研究提出想象力的计算目标是访问内部世界模型，并通过心理网络分析比较人类和大型语言模型的想象力网络，发现两者在内部世界模型上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索想象力的计算目标，挑战传统认为想象力主要用于最大化奖励的观点，研究人类和AI在内部世界模型上的相似性。

Method: 使用心理网络分析方法，通过问卷调查评估想象力生动度，构建想象力网络，比较人类和大型语言模型在不同提示和对话记忆条件下的网络特征。

Result: 人类想象力网络显示不同中心性指标之间存在相关性，而大型语言模型的想象力网络缺乏聚类且中心性指标相关性较低，表明两者内部世界模型存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一种比较人类和AI内部生成表征的新方法，为开发类人想象力的人工智能提供了见解。

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical
interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent
findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves
to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis
to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we
assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed
imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups
showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected
influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs
showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures
under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these
results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents.
Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated
representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like
imagination in artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TraitBasis是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，通过系统性地压力测试AI代理来评估其鲁棒性。该方法在激活空间中学习可操控的用户特质方向，无需微调即可在推理时控制、缩放和组合这些特质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI代理在用户行为轻微变化（如更不耐烦、语无伦次或怀疑）时性能会急剧下降，显示出其脆弱性。现有的基准测试无法捕捉这种脆弱性，需要更系统的鲁棒性测试方法。

Method: TraitBasis在激活空间中学习可操控的用户特质方向，这些特质向量可以在推理时被控制、缩放、组合和应用，无需额外微调或数据。该方法扩展了τ-Bench到τ-Trait，通过受控特质向量改变用户行为。

Result: 在τ-Trait上，前沿模型的性能平均下降了2%-30%，突显出现有AI代理对用户行为变化的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: TraitBasis作为一个简单、数据高效且可组合的工具，为构建在真实世界人类交互不可预测动态中保持可靠的AI代理打开了大门。该方法已在四个领域开源：航空、零售、电信和远程医疗。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in building conversational AI agents, robustness is
still largely untested. Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more
impatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent
performance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks
fail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard
evaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We
address this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,
model-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis
learns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits
(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,
and applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using
TraitBasis, we extend $\tau$-Bench to $\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are
altered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%
performance degradation on $\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting
the lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.
Together, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing
and the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional
tool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis
opens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable
dynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $\tau$-Trai
across four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community
can systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse
intents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChartAgent是一个新颖的代理框架，通过在图表空间域中执行视觉推理来解决未标注图表的视觉问答问题，超越了依赖文本捷径的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态LLM在基于图表的视觉问答中表现良好，但在需要精确视觉解释而非依赖文本捷径的未标注图表上性能急剧下降。

Method: ChartAgent迭代地将查询分解为视觉子任务，通过专门的视觉工具（如绘制注释、裁剪区域、定位坐标轴）主动操作和交互图表图像，模拟人类认知策略。

Result: 在ChartBench和ChartX基准测试中达到最先进准确率，整体绝对增益达16.07%，在未标注数值密集型查询上增益达17.31%。

Conclusion: ChartAgent是首批使用工具增强多模态代理展示基于视觉推理的图表理解工作之一，可作为即插即用框架提升各种底层LLM性能。

Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question
answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those
requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual
shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework
that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial
domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively
decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts
with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations,
cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing
axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.
This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for
chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the
ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07%
absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.
Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse
chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning
complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts
performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to
demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using
tool-augmented multimodal agents.

TL;DR: 研究发现VLM驾驶代理中的推理与规划存在因果脱节，推理只是训练的副产品而非因果中介。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证VLM驾驶代理中自然语言推理是否真正因果驱动轨迹规划这一关键假设。

Method: 构建DriveMind数据集，通过信息消融实验训练VLM代理，并使用注意力分析和训练无关的探针进行诊断。

Result: 移除先验信息导致规划分数大幅下降，而移除推理链仅产生微小变化，表明规划主要依赖先验而非推理。

Conclusion: 提出推理-规划解耦假说，为社区提供新数据集和诊断工具来评估未来模型的因果保真度。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end
autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting
trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this
reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we
build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus
with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan.
Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured
inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling
clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM
agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately,
indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing
ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing
CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning
primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we
propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the
training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal
mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel,
training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating
its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we
provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the
causal fidelity of future models.

TL;DR: BrokenMath是首个评估LLMs在自然语言定理证明中谄媚行为的基准，发现GPT-5等先进模型在29%的情况下会产生谄媚答案，通过干预策略可减少但无法完全消除该行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要关注最终答案问题，缺乏对定理证明中谄媚行为的系统评估，限制了LLMs在定理证明中的应用。

Method: 基于2025年竞赛问题构建BrokenMath基准，使用LLM扰动生成错误陈述并通过专家评审精炼，采用LLM-as-a-judge框架评估模型表现。

Result: 发现谄媚行为普遍存在，GPT-5在29%的情况下产生谄媚答案；测试时干预和监督微调可显著减少但不能完全消除该行为。

Conclusion: LLMs在数学定理证明中存在显著谄媚问题，需要更有效的缓解策略来提升其可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on
mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and
sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect
mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the
applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed
proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing
benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus
solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated
datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that
create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are
demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first
benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of
natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025
competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false
statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an
LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems
and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing
sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation
strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on
curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not
eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在简单任务中倾向于过度使用System 2型推理，导致token生成效率低下，且由于预训练数据的静态性难以适应快速变化的环境。

Method: 提出MARS多智能体系统，整合Google搜索、Google学术和Python解释器等外部工具，通过分工协作让System 1处理高容量外部信息，System 2进行深度推理，并采用多智能体强化学习框架优化系统协作。

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam基准上实现3.86%的显著提升，在7个知识密集型任务上平均获得8.9%的性能增益。

Conclusion: MARS的双系统范式在动态信息环境中对复杂推理任务具有显著效果，验证了直觉与深思推理整合的有效性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in
simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate
reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models
face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing
environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address
these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning
tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate
cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless
integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate
reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools,
such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access
up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a
specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and
summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that
expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both
systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample
balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the
challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9%
across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our
dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在动态协作环境中推断他人行为背后原理的能力，这是有效多智能体协作所需的心智理论能力。

Method: 引入LLM-Hanabi基准，使用合作游戏《花火》评估LLMs的心智理论和推理能力，采用自动化评估系统测量游戏表现和心智理论熟练度。

Result: 发现心智理论与游戏成功呈显著正相关，一阶心智理论（解释他人意图）比二阶心智理论（预测他人解释）与表现相关性更强。

Conclusion: 对于有效的AI协作，准确解释合作伙伴原理的能力比高阶推理更关键，优先发展一阶心智理论是增强未来模型协作能力的有前景方向。

Abstract: Effective multi-agent collaboration requires agents to infer the rationale
behind others' actions, a capability rooted in Theory-of-Mind (ToM). While
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability
to infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.
This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative
game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework
features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and
ToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive
correlation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM
(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than
second-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight
that for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a
partner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude
that prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the
collaborative capabilities of future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理需要基于多样化、不断变化的应用和环境来规划任务工作流，但目标应用领域缺乏大规模高质量训练数据，现有数据集存在领域特定、静态和标注成本高等限制。

Method: 采用逆动力学目标框架，从连续屏幕状态预测用户动作，开发了包含任务感知视频检索的逆动力学标注流水线，从原始网络视频生成高质量轨迹。

Result: 生成了超过53k条高质量轨迹，在OSWorld基准测试中，W&L提取的UI轨迹显著提升了通用和最先进框架的上下文性能，并为开源模型的监督训练带来更强增益。

Conclusion: 网络规模的人类演示视频是推进计算机使用代理向实际部署的实用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse,
ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application.
Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while
current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned
task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn
(W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available
on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly
generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the
problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from
consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is
easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely,
we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video
retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and
demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context
demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld
benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both
general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver
stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results
highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable
foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.
