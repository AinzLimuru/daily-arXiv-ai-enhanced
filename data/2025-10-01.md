*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net的扩散模型在文本到动作生成中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高级特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，包含双路径锚定：1) 轻量级MoCLIP模型提供时域语义监督；2) 频域对齐信号从低频DCT分量提取。通过时间调制机制自适应融合两个锚点。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别达到0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，实现了高效可扩展的高保真动作生成。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新颖的视觉问答基准测试，包含2720个问题-答案对，专注于在密集场景中测试模型的基础视觉理解能力，发现现有VLM模型在复杂场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试可能高估了视觉语言模型(VLM)的性能，特别是在处理密集场景时。作者认为编码和推理细节对VLM来说仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，这些图像包含多个人物、动作和复杂背景。手动标注了六个任务类别的问题来全面测试场景理解能力。

Result: 测试了37个模型，最好的模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题上的总体准确率为69.5%。发现了多种失败模式，包括计数能力不足、OCR失败和逻辑不一致。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型在密集场景理解方面的关键差距，为社区开发更好的模型提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种学习框架来编辑视频中的生理信号（心率），同时保持视觉保真度，以解决基于摄像头的生理信号估计带来的隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的生理信号估计虽然方便，但面部视频中的生命信号会泄露个人健康和情绪状态等敏感信息，存在严重的隐私问题。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器将输入视频编码到潜在空间，通过冻结的文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，使用可训练的时空层和自适应层归一化融合信息，在解码器中应用特征线性调制和微调输出层来避免生理信号退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，使用最先进的rPPG估计器实现平均心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效控制心率编辑，可用于匿名化真实视频中的生物特征信号或合成具有所需生命体征的逼真视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的诊断基准，重点关注视角转换能力，揭示了当前模型存在自我中心偏见、旋转理解差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在系统性弱点，需要专门的诊断基准来评估其视角转换能力，这是空间推理的核心挑战。

Method: 设计了围绕视角转换的精细诊断类别，包括平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化，从简单单物体任务逐步过渡到复杂多物体视角转换场景。

Result: 评估了37个最先进的视觉语言模型，发现存在强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和语法重构下表现不一致等问题。人类准确率达到91.2%，但任务难度与模型准确性高度相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解视觉语言模型的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，揭示了它们在物理空间推理方面的关键差距，能够捕捉人类和模型共享的空间推理挑战。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了多模态时空Transformer（MM-STT）框架，融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，通过联合时空注意力机制统一处理多模态特征，在EGMS数据集上实现了最先进的土地沉降预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且现有工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息进行高分辨率土地沉降预测。

Method: 开发了多模态时空Transformer（MM-STT）框架，核心创新是联合时空注意力机制，能够统一处理动态位移数据和静态物理先验等多模态特征。

Result: 在公开EGMS数据集上建立了新的最先进水平，相比所有基线方法（包括STGCN和STAEformer等SOTA方法），长程预测的RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于这类问题，架构内在的深度多模态融合能力对于实现变革性性能至关重要，多模态融合是提升预测精度的关键因素。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision语言模型(VLMs)通过文本交互处理视觉任务，但在3D理解上表现不佳。本文提出的DepthLM方法通过文本监督微调和视觉提示，让VLMs在像素级深度估计任务上达到专家级精度，无需修改架构或损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在3D理解方面表现不佳，而专业视觉模型虽然精度高但需要特定架构和损失函数。研究是否能让VLMs在不改变架构或损失的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 使用文本监督微调稀疏标签，结合视觉提示和相机内参条件增强，解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题。无需密集预测头或复杂回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使VLMs在深度估计精度上超越最先进VLMs 2倍以上，首次与纯视觉模型相媲美。同时自然地避免了过度平滑，在边界区域飞点更少。

Conclusion: VLMs通过简单方法即可解锁强大的3D理解能力，单一VLM可覆盖多种3D任务，为3D视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的贝叶斯Transformer方法，用于泛北极海冰浓度制图和不确定性量化，融合Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据，实现高分辨率海冰制图和可靠的不确定性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 泛北极高分辨率海冰制图及其可靠的不确定性评估对海冰浓度制图至关重要，但由于冰特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战而难以实现。

Method: 设计具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型以改进特征提取；开发贝叶斯Transformer扩展，将参数视为随机变量以改进不确定性量化；在决策级融合三种不同类型数据（Sentinel-1、RCM、AMSR2）。

Result: 在2021年9月的泛北极数据集上测试，相比其他不确定性量化方法，所提模型能够实现高分辨率海冰制图和稳健的不确定性制图。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了海冰制图中的关键挑战，为泛北极海冰监测提供了高精度和可靠的不确定性评估工具。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过整合路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器，开发了可扩展的车辆检测和定位框架，采用卡尔曼滤波融合策略提升轨迹精度，在仿真中纵向误差减少70%，现场验证显示融合轨迹能可靠匹配真实车辆路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施感知系统在实际部署中面临的透视失真、复杂几何、遮挡和成本等障碍，为高风险路段（如施工区域）提供更安全的车辆跟踪方案。

Method: 集成路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器到协同仿真环境，开发车辆检测和定位框架，采用基于卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略来增强轨迹一致性和准确性。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差降低达70%，同时保持横向精度在1-3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹能紧密匹配真实车辆路径，即使在单传感器数据间歇或降级时也能保持可靠性。

Conclusion: 基于卡尔曼滤波的传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器的局限性，为复杂交通环境提供精确鲁棒的车辆跟踪能力，是实现基础设施支持的多传感器系统用于主动安全措施的实际途径。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

TL;DR: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，通过"先观察后推理"的新范式解决MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中的性能不佳问题，强调增强伪影感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，根本原因在于视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低层次伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据与预训练分布差异大导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat框架，首先训练MLLMs感知伪影以增强视觉感知能力，然后基于实际观察进行推理，同时构建ExplainFake-Bench评估基准。

Result: 实验表明该方法在泛化性和可解释性方面表现优越，能够提供真正可靠的可解释性。

Conclusion: "先观察后推理"的新范式能有效提升MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中的性能，解决了视觉感知不足和知识遗忘问题。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视线追踪技术检测实时视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析视线模式来识别无法模仿人类微妙非语言交流的深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的进步，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。由于深度伪造无法模仿人类在对话中的微妙视线交流模式，这为检测提供了机会。

Method: 基于对二元对话中视线模式研究的可解释特征构建模型，利用恶意行为者视频流中的估计视线来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建数据集上测试，准确率达到82%，这是首个利用视线点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法。

Conclusion: 视线追踪技术为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的新途径，能够利用深度伪造无法复制的非语言交流特征进行识别。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉的6-DoF物体姿态估计算法，专门为火星样本返回任务设计，在硬件受限条件下实现鲁棒的物体定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机械臂需要在严重硬件约束下对多个目标物体进行低间隙拾取和插入时的定位问题。

Method: 使用自定义渲染器和针对边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低精度、无纹理的3D模型作为输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试台和火星实地图像上的广泛评估表明，该方法在计算和内存受限的定位任务中，在鲁棒性和准确性方面均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的廉价可靠定位开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

### [12] [LLM-RG: Referential Grounding in Outdoor Scenarios using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25528)
*Pranav Saxena,Avigyan Bhattacharya,Ji Zhang,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG是一个结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型的混合管道，用于解决户外驾驶场景中的指称接地问题，在Talk2Car基准测试中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指称接地具有挑战性，因为场景变化大、视觉相似对象多、动态元素复杂，使得解析自然语言引用（如"右边的黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: LLM-RG结合了现成的视觉语言模型进行细粒度属性提取和大型语言模型进行符号推理。通过LLM提取相关对象类型和属性，检测候选区域，使用VLM生成丰富的视觉描述符，然后将这些描述符与空间元数据结合成自然语言提示，输入LLM进行链式推理以识别指称对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升。消融实验表明，添加3D空间线索能进一步改进接地性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，以零样本方式应用的VLM和LLM具有互补优势，能够实现鲁棒的户外指称接地。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++是一种通过优化视觉输入来实现视觉语言模型行为控制的方法，无需运行时访问模型内部，适用于开放和闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示容易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。

Method: 通过生成优化的视觉输入（VISOR++图像）来诱导目标激活模式，实现对模型行为的控制，无需运行时模型访问。

Result: VISOR++图像在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上实现了与转向向量相当的性能，在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上有效，并在未见模型上表现出泛化能力，同时在14,000个MMLU评估任务上保持99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，通过视觉输入实现有效的模型行为转向，适用于各种视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的视觉语言模型自改进框架，通过任意图像对生成竞争性视觉游戏，实现模型在推理、图表问答等任务上的持续性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前强化学习方法依赖人工构建数据集导致训练成本高、限制视觉语言模型实际部署的问题。

Method: 提出战略自玩框架，让模型在"谁是卧底"式游戏中扮演多个角色进行战略推理；使用任意图像生成游戏；引入迭代自玩策略优化算法，结合自玩和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在推理、图表问答和视觉中心理解任务上达到最先进性能，超越其他基于标注的方法。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了无需人工标注即可实现视觉语言模型的自改进，具有强大的泛化能力和持续性能增益。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

TL;DR: 提出一种结合数学/聚类分割模型与U-Net的混合方法，用于脉络膜痣的精确分割，在1024*1024眼底图像上达到89.7%的Dice系数和80.01%的IoU，显著优于Attention U-Net。


<details>

Conclusion: 该混合模型为脉络膜痣诊断决策支持系统开发提供了基础，有望通过自动病灶标注提高诊断和监测的速度与准确性。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for

Motivation: 现有的ViG框架中的图卷积方法（如Max-Relative、EdgeConv等）缺乏能够有效捕捉复杂节点-邻居关系且无需架构特定优化的通用聚合方法。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制进行特征聚合，其中查询投影来自节点，键投影来自其邻居，并构建了AttentionViG架构进行非局部消息传递。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K基准测试中达到SOTA性能，在MS COCO 2017的目标检测和实例分割以及ADE20K的语义分割等下游任务中展现出良好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法不仅实现了强大的性能，而且保持了效率，在计算量相当的情况下提供了与先前视觉GNN架构相竞争的准确性。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了MetaChest数据集和评估框架，研究医学图像中的广义少样本多标签分类问题，发现迁移学习方法在胸部X光病理分类中优于专门的少样本学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据稀缺，传统少样本学习假设所有类别都是新的，但实际医学应用需要同时学习新类别并利用已知类别知识，这更符合广义少样本分类场景。

Method: 构建包含479,215张胸部X光片的MetaChest数据集，设计元集划分和多标签episode生成算法，评估迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展在少样本多标签分类任务中的表现。

Result: 增加每episode的类别数和每类训练样本数可提升性能；迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算成本；高效模型架构能以更少资源达到可比性能。

Conclusion: 在医学图像少样本学习中，简单的迁移学习方法可能比专门的少样本学习方法更有效，同时需要在精度和计算效率之间权衡。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一知识源和特定任务，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识的实际情况形成鲜明对比。

Method: 将异构知识源编码为双提示表示：1-D稀疏提示定义分割内容，2-D密集提示指示关注区域，通过混合专家解码器动态路由。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，K-Prism在语义、上下文和交互分割设置中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism成功统一了三种知识范式，无需架构修改即可在不同任务间灵活切换和联合训练。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: 提出的局部高分辨率重建方法有效解决了统一高分辨率重建的成本问题，实现了按需的精细细节重建。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Motivation: 全球范围内威胁视力的眼病负担严重，但及时诊断受到医疗资源短缺和专科服务获取限制的阻碍。虽然多模态大语言模型在医学图像解释方面显示出潜力，但缺乏适合评估生成模型的全面基准数据集阻碍了眼科MLLMs的发展。

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

Motivation: 现有的跨视角物体地理定位方法大多采用基于锚框的范式，这种方法受到预定义锚框的固有约束。为了消除这种依赖，需要开发无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接为每个像素预测到真实框的四个方向偏移量（左、右、上、下），采用高斯位置编码来建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，并引入跨视角物体关联模块来关联不同视角下的同一物体及其周围环境。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，模型轻量且计算高效。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式，结合高斯位置编码和跨视角物体关联模块，以最小的参数开销实现了跨视角物体地理定位的最优性能。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: GCL是一种有效的损失函数公式，能够显著提升多模态检索性能，同时避免了繁琐的数据集构建过程。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Conclusion: Geo-DLC任务和DescribeEarth模型能够有效解决遥感图像细粒度对象级描述问题，为遥感图像理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,

*Po-Heng Chou,Chun-Chi Wang,Wei-Lung Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLO的深度学习模型用于工业制造中的自动缺陷检测，结合ConSinGAN进行数据增强，YOLOv9模型表现最佳，准确率达91.3%，检测时间146ms。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中金属板材缺陷检测耗时耗力的问题，特别是针对金属板材图像数据不足导致检测精度下降的挑战。

Method: 使用ConSinGAN生成大量数据，结合四种YOLO模型（v3、v4、v7、v9）进行缺陷检测，并将最佳模型集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中。

Result: YOLOv9模型结合ConSinGAN表现最优，准确率91.3%，检测时间146ms，成功建立实用的自动光学检测系统。

Conclusion: 提出的自动缺陷检测方法有效解决了工业制造中的检测问题，且易于扩展到其他工业组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

*Shiyu Wu,Shuyan Li,Jing Li,Jing Liu,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图像来源识别范式——开放集少样本来源识别，并开发了OmniDFA框架，能够使用有限样本可靠识别未见过的生成器，同时构建了包含117万张图像的大规模数据集OmniFake。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像检测和来源模型识别面临生成模型结构多样性的挑战，现有检测方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，而来源识别由于缺乏大规模分类数据集而受限。

Method: 提出OmniDFA框架，采用开放集少样本来源识别范式，构建包含117万张图像、来自45个不同生成模型的OmniFake数据集。

Result: 实验表明OmniDFA在开放集来源识别方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到了最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA框架为AIGI检测和来源识别提供了有效解决方案，其数据集和代码将公开可用。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

*Xiping Li,Jianghong Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一个主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过上下文增强注意力图生成、主动视觉探测和动态注意力转移触发三个组件，解决了现有方法依赖不可靠注意力图和被动选择策略的问题，显著提升了多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但实证分析显示这些注意力图不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个协同组件：1) 上下文增强注意力图生成(CAG)，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；2) 主动视觉探测(AVP)，基于信息理论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；3) 动态注意力转移触发(DAT)，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移来确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上的广泛实验表明，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理迈出的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

### [29] [How Diffusion Models Memorize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25705)
*Juyeop Kim,Songkuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型会记忆训练数据，本文通过分析潜空间动态揭示了记忆机制：早期去噪过程中的训练样本高估是记忆的核心驱动因素，这降低了多样性、使去噪轨迹坍缩并加速向记忆图像的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然图像生成成功，但会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有研究未能从根本上解释记忆为何及如何发生，本文旨在回答"扩散模型如何记忆"这一核心问题。

Method: 重新审视扩散和去噪过程，分析潜空间动态，研究训练样本高估、分类器无引导放大预测、记忆提示注入训练图像等机制对记忆的影响。

Result: 发现：(i)记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，训练损失在记忆时更大；(ii)记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，迫使潜轨迹收敛；(iii)中间潜变量分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制并被记忆内容替代。

Conclusion: 早期高估是扩散模型记忆的核心机制，偏离理论去噪计划与记忆严重程度高度相关，这为理解和缓解记忆问题提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProbMED是一种多模态医疗视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，将四种医疗模态对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间，在跨模态检索和分类任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗视觉语言预训练模型未能直接建模医疗信息的多对多映射关系，需要一种能够处理多模态医疗数据的方法。

Method: 使用概率对比学习建模嵌入分布，采用InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合模态间分布，引入概率合成采样损失捕获模态特定均值和方差。

Result: 在13个医疗数据集上的实验表明，模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类任务上优于现有Med-VLPMs，实现了更好的模态间和模态内绑定。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率方法有效整合多种医疗模态，为医疗决策提供了更强大的多模态分析能力。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities--chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text--into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISP-DPO提出了一种多负样本的视觉语言模型偏好优化框架，通过Plackett-Luce模型处理多模态偏好学习中的复杂语义关系，解决了现有方法中单一负样本导致的优化偏差和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法在视觉语言模型中依赖简化的成对比较，仅通过基本扰动或相似性检索生成单一负样本，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，使用稀疏自编码器解析语义偏差，基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择多负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略提高训练效率。

Result: 在五个多样化基准测试中，MISP-DPO持续优于现有方法，在多模态对齐方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中具有有效性，能够提供更广泛和更有信息的监督。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注描述符微调或固定采样策略，忽略了训练过程中空间上下文和视觉相似性之间的动态交互作用。

Method: 提出SAGE统一训练管道，包含轻量级Soft Probing模块学习补丁描述符的残差权重，构建在线地理-视觉图融合地理邻近性和当前视觉相似性，使用加权团扩展采样器聚焦信息量最大的地点邻域。

Result: 在8个基准测试中达到SOTA，SPED、Pitts30k-test、MSLS-val和Nordland的Recall@1分别达到98.9%、95.8%、94.5%和96.0%，在SPED上仅使用4096D全局描述符就获得100%的Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态整合空间上下文和视觉相似性，显著提升了视觉地点识别的性能，证明了联合优化局部特征聚合和训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

*Zhenghao Zhang,Ziying Zhang,Junchao Liao,Xiangyu Meng,Qiang Hu,Siyu Zhu,Xiaoyun Zhang,Long Qin,Weizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑。它通过将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记，结合位置映射位置编码，实现了灵活解耦的几何-外观交互，显著提升了身份保持和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难。传统方法将地标作为刚性几何约束，当地标条件与源图像差异较大时（如大表情或姿态变化、地标估计不准确）会损害身份信息。

Method: 提出LaTo框架，包含三个关键创新：(1) 地标标记器将原始地标坐标直接量化为离散面部标记；(2) 位置映射位置编码整合面部和图像标记，实现高效解耦的几何-外观交互；(3) 地标预测器利用视觉语言模型从指令和源图像推断目标地标。

Result: 在HFL-150K基准测试上，LaTo在身份保持方面比最先进方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LaTo通过地标标记化和统一的位置编码方法，有效解决了人脸编辑中的精确属性控制和身份保持问题，为细粒度人脸编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in

Motivation: 从单张RGB图像恢复3D人体网格存在固有的模糊性，现有方法要么回归单一确定性输出，要么在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。需要一种能够建模良好对齐分布的方法。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成3D旋转参数分布，通过条件丢弃实现无条件和图像条件生成。采用时间无关的transformer提取关节潜在向量，小型MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的每个关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，解决了准确性和多样性的权衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的SO(3)扩散模型方法能够有效建模人体姿态的概率分布，在保持准确性的同时提供多样性输出，优于现有概率方法。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

Motivation: 传统基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场，联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验；引入无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域；单次前向传播实现连贯编辑。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，显示出优越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过几何引导实现了精确、一致和结构保持的图像编辑，解决了传统2D编辑方法在几何变换中的局限性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视图像素反投影射线交集的弱几何约束，重建质量严重依赖输入视图密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: IPDRecon框架包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon在视图数量减少40%时仍能保持近乎相同的重建质量，变异系数仅为0.24%，性能保持率达99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用单视图内的空间信息为实际应用中的视图受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案，显著提升了重建稳定性。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a
single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we
curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge,
public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust
perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series
employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,
instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0
delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and
report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning
transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with
ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound
tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best
model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs
competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show
reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy,
consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes
medical AI.

*Junseo Park,Hyeryung Jang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个用于虚拟试穿的测量引导扩散框架，通过轨迹对齐求解器解决非试穿区域保留问题，消除边界伪影，提升视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在保留非试穿区域（身份和背景）方面存在挑战，直接替换策略会产生边界伪影，需要更平滑的过渡方法。

Method: 将虚拟试穿重新表述为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器渐进执行测量一致性，结合残差先验初始化缓解训练-推理不匹配，以及无伪影测量引导采样。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保留身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的非试穿区域保留问题，实现了无伪影的高质量图像生成。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了文本偏好优化（TPO）框架，无需配对的图像偏好数据即可实现文本到图像模型的"免费午餐"对齐，通过让模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示来提升文本-图像对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于人类反馈的强化学习方法依赖昂贵的配对图像偏好数据或学习奖励函数，面临可扩展性限制，需要一种无需配对图像数据的对齐方法。

Method: 使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示而非不匹配提示，将DPO和KTO算法扩展到该设置得到TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中的定量和定性评估表明，该方法始终优于原始对应方法，提供更好的人类偏好分数和改进的文本到图像对齐。

Conclusion: TPO框架实现了无需配对图像偏好数据的文本到图像模型对齐，具有良好的通用性和兼容性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at
https://github.com/DSL-Lab/T2I-Free-Lunch-Alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了v-HUB视觉幽默理解基准，评估多模态大语言模型仅通过视觉线索理解幽默的能力，发现模型在纯视觉幽默理解上存在困难，音频的加入能提升理解效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估和诊断多模态大语言模型理解幽默的能力，特别是在仅通过视觉线索的场景下，这对提升人机交互的参与度具有重要意义。

Method: 构建v-HUB基准，包含来自经典默片和在线资源的非语言短视频，配以字幕、描述和解释等丰富标注，支持字幕匹配和幽默解释等评估任务。

Result: 实验结果显示MLLMs在仅通过视觉线索理解幽默方面存在困难，所有模型在从文本评估转向视频评估时性能显著下降，音频的加入有助于视频幽默理解。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在纯视觉幽默理解方面仍有挑战，声音信息对复杂视频理解任务具有价值，整合更丰富的模态有望提升模型性能。

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

*Jeongjae Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCPO框架来解决文本到图像模型强化学习中的训练不稳定问题，通过比例信用分配加速收敛并提升图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化(PCPO)，通过稳定的目标重构和时间步重新加权来强制比例信用分配

Result: PCPO显著加速了收敛过程，提升了图像质量，并在所有方面优于现有策略梯度基线方法

Conclusion: PCPO通过纠正不成比例的信用分配问题，有效稳定了训练过程，解决了模型崩溃这一常见失败模式

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

### [44] [Editable Noise Map Inversion: Encoding Target-image into Noise For High-Fidelity Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25776)
*Mingyu Kang,Yong Suk Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ENM Inversion方法，通过搜索最优噪声图来同时保证内容保持和编辑能力，解决了现有文本引导图像编辑方法在遵循目标文本提示方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型图像编辑方法在将源图像反转为可编辑噪声图时，虽然能忠实重建源图像，但限制了编辑灵活性，难以紧密遵循目标文本提示。

Method: 分析噪声图特性以增强可编辑性，提出可编辑噪声优化方法，通过最小化重建噪声图和编辑噪声图之间的差异来对齐期望的编辑效果。

Result: 大量实验表明，ENM Inversion在广泛的图像编辑任务中，在内容保持和编辑保真度方面均优于现有方法，并能轻松应用于视频编辑以实现时间一致性和跨帧内容操作。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是一种新颖的反转技术，能够有效平衡内容保持和编辑灵活性，显著提升文本引导图像和视频编辑的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一个自监督框架，通过自我一致性原理让视觉语言模型在无真实标签的情况下自主提升图像质量评估能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于有监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在图像质量评估等感知任务中依赖昂贵人工标注数据的问题，探索自监督方法在感知领域的应用潜力。

Method: 采用基于排名的自我一致性方法，通过多数投票生成伪标签，构建保真度奖励，使用组相对策略优化进行迭代进化。

Result: 在零样本设置下将基础模型的PLCC性能提升31.8%，在7个IQA基准中的5个上超越最先进的有监督VLM模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality证明了自监督方法在视觉感知任务中的有效性，为减少对人工标注的依赖提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率性师生模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)因其低成本和易获取性被广泛用于评估心脏功能。研究表明ECG可以预测传统上需要更复杂模态(如超声心动图ECHO)才能获得的关键结果，使ECG成为预测心脏功能的更易获取方法。ECHO需要大量医院资源但在临床心脏评估中起关键作用。

Method: 引入EchoingECG概率师生模型，整合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和ECHO-CLIP(在ECHO-文本对上预训练的视觉语言模型)，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证显示，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计增强了模型性能理解，识别了ECG中的不确定性区域。

Conclusion: EchoingECG通过不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督，成功改进了基于ECG的心脏功能预测，为使用更易获取的ECG替代资源密集的ECHO提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLM的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 设计分层评估协议（S1：目标定位，S2：任务驱动指向，S3：视觉轨迹预测），在室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等关键领域收集数据。

Result: 对10多个最先进VLM的广泛实验发现：GPT-4o等通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在前两个阶段表现良好但在视觉轨迹规划阶段表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了当前VLM在精确视觉定位和具身推理方面的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种动态相似性图适应(DSGA)模块，结合LoRA技术，在极少量数据条件下对SAM模型进行参数高效微调，用于农业环境中密集小物体的精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型的参数高效微调面临训练数据有限和复杂田间条件的挑战，需要开发在极端数据约束下仍能有效工作的适应方法。

Method: 通过动态相似性图构建（使用可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制）和自适应局部特征聚合，结合LoRA技术，建立了一个互补优化框架，仅需4.00M可训练参数。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA与LoRA组合在2、4、8和10次样本设置下均表现优异，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，在10-120个豆荚的图像中实现准确计数（调整R平方0.8987）。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持模型稳定性和参数效率的同时，有效捕捉图像嵌入中的局部和全局依赖关系，为自动化农业监测应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs主要评估通用基准，在智能产品审核等特定领域应用不足。传统logo识别方法需要记忆数万个品牌表示，在实际场景中不实用。

Method: 将logo识别重新定义为基于比较的任务，匹配产品图像与候选logo而非直接生成品牌标签。引入Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Result: Logo-VGR在OOD设置中比强基线方法提升近10个点，展示了优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过领域特定的多模态推理范式，实现了仅使用少量品牌监督就能泛化到大规模品牌识别的能力，解决了现有模型过度拟合品牌分布的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the state-
of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing data, we
organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023. The
training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Conclusion: VELA是首个专门针对长图像描述设计的自动评估指标，能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，在评估长描述方面表现出色。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

*Jinho Chang,Jaemin Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的奖励引导图像编辑框架，将编辑过程建模为轨迹最优控制问题，通过伴随状态迭代更新来引导编辑过程，在保持源图像语义内容的同时提升目标奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励引导方法主要关注图像生成，而在图像编辑任务中如何利用奖励引导来保持源图像语义内容同时增强目标奖励的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，通过伴随状态迭代更新来引导编辑过程，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种编辑任务上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间实现了更好的平衡，且避免了奖励作弊。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导的图像编辑提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够在不牺牲图像质量的情况下实现目标奖励的优化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了多模态推理的双重性：虽然能增强逻辑推理能力，但会损害感知基础，导致视觉遗忘。作者提出了Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法来解决这个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现多模态推理虽然能提升复杂任务的解决能力，但会逐渐削弱模型的感知基础，导致对基础视觉问题的识别失败，这种现象被称为视觉遗忘。

Method: 提出了Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，通过明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，并在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力和感知基础，为视觉语言模型的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，其严谨的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前最先进视觉语言模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 创建MuSLR基准，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域，包括35个原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度从2到9。提出LogiCAM模块化框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Result: 评估的7个VLMs在多模态符号推理上都表现挣扎，最佳模型GPT-4.1仅达到46.8%准确率。LogiCAM框架将GPT-4.1的思维链性能提升了14.13%，在复杂逻辑如一阶逻辑上提升更大。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著不足，约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不对齐。LogiCAM框架展示了将形式逻辑规则集成到多模态推理中的有效性，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All
data and code are publicly available at https://llm-symbol.github.io/MuSLR.

TL;DR: 提出PatchEAD框架，基于补丁的免训练异常检测方法，兼容多种基础模型，无需文本特征即可实现优异的零样本和少样本性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工业异常检测主要依赖文本提示调优，而视觉对应部分分散在不同基础模型的处理步骤中，缺乏统一框架

Method: 构建统一的补丁聚焦框架，包含对齐模块和前景掩码的视觉提示技术，无需训练即可进行异常检测

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景下表现优于先前工作，无需文本特征，为实际视觉检测提供基础模型选择和配置指导

Conclusion: 统一的纯补丁框架能够实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Motivation: 融合摄像头和LiDAR数据以增强空间理解，特别是在低光照条件下需要提高感知能力。

Method: 通过初始校准确定相机内参，自动计算LiDAR与相机间的几何变换，无需专用校准目标；使用色彩校正确保相机数据一致性，集成低光图像增强模块。

Result: 使用Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR和四摄像头配置测试，优化软件实现实时性能，在极低光照下仍能可靠着色，成功恢复原本不可见的场景细节。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、鲁棒的LiDAR点云着色方案，特别适用于低光照环境，简化了系统设置并提升了感知能力。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过整合多尺度视觉语义和分层预测，显著提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Motivation: 推动视觉语言模型从文本主导的思维链转向图像交互推理的"图像思维"范式，解决现有方法在数据构建准确性、结构设计和应用场景方面的不足。

Method: 构建包含31k条思维链推理轨迹的数据集，设计直接在视觉嵌入空间生成"视觉思维"的模型，实现无需外部工具和重复图像编码的图像-文本交错推理。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现出强大性能，验证了数据集的有效性和模型设计的优越性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过高质量数据集和创新的模型设计，成功推进了"图像思维"范式的发展，为多模态推理提供了更灵活和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation

first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型擅长高级场景理解，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，因为语言中心架构难以生成精确的数值坐标。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，包含混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，将物体感知重新构建为特征检索任务而非坐标生成问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在物体定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色，且不损害基础模型的通用视觉理解能力。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1为构建感知感知的视觉语言模型建立了有效灵活的模式，弥合了高级推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了训练数据特征对深度神经网络对抗鲁棒性的影响，发现鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律增长，但数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模在实现广谱对抗韧性方面更具决定性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络架构和训练范式有所进步，但仍容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特征如何影响对抗鲁棒性，挑战仅靠规模就能驱动鲁棒性的假设。

Method: 评估了36个最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督、自监督和对比学习方法，在6种黑盒攻击类别下进行测试：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格偏移。

Result: 鲁棒性随数据量和模型规模呈对数缩放规律：数据量增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率(ASR)约3.2%，模型规模增加10倍平均降低ASR约13.4%。自监督模型在精选数据集上训练时表现优于在更大但较少精选数据集上训练的模型。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模能提高鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗韧性方面比原始规模更具决定性作用。人类评估揭示了人类与机器视觉之间存在的持续差距。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一的框架有效解决了多模态多类异常检测中的碎片化和效率问题，在保持稀疏激活和快速推理的同时显著提升了性能

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验表明，相比标准基线和先前组合方法，CO3在概念覆盖度、平衡性和鲁棒性方面均有改进，概念丢失或扭曲更少。

Conclusion: 轻量级修正引导可以显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为，该方法即插即用，无需模型调优，可与标准无分类器引导互补。

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单独训练的检测模块，需要大量专家标注，成本高且受限于数据集间的病理分布偏差。

Method: 构建层次化解剖图，通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，并基于解剖一致性引入区域级对比学习。

Result: 在词汇准确率上超越最先进方法10%，临床效能提升25%，在零样本视觉定位任务中超越领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL无需专家标注即可生成准确且基于视觉证据的医疗报告，在多个下游视觉任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Method: 使用姿态估计网络提取鲑鱼及其身体部位的边界框，通过专门模块利用身体部位信息处理水下鲑鱼场景的特定挑战，然后利用高细节的身体部位轨迹计算福利指标。

Conclusion: 所提出的追踪框架能够有效解决水下鲑鱼场景的追踪挑战，为自动化鲑鱼福利监测提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available
at https://github.com/espenbh/BoostCompTrack.

Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法在处理稀疏的真实世界扫描时表现不佳，且缺乏标注数据。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线创建大规模场景级数据集，并提出了基于少量用户点点击的交互式分割框架。

Result: 在首次点击设置下平均IoU达到55.8%，仅需少量额外点击即可超过71.3% IoU，相比现有方法IoU和精度提升高达16%。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更精细和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RH-Partial2Global方法，通过结合jackknife共形预测和覆盖设计采样，改进了视觉上下文学习中的示例选择机制，解决了现有方法依赖随机采样和相似性优先假设的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于相似性优先假设，但该假设缺乏充分理论依据；而且Partial2Global依赖随机采样构建全局排名，导致覆盖不完整和采样冗余，影响最终性能。

Method: 提出RH-Partial2Global方法：1）使用jackknife共形预测构建可靠的替代集；2）采用覆盖设计采样确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 大量实验表明，RH-Partial2Global在各种视觉任务中表现优异，优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过可靠的替代集构建和全面的偏好覆盖，实现了更有效的上下文示例选择，提升了视觉上下文学习的性能。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型存在二次计算复杂度问题，难以适应长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现了3.7倍加速和60%内存使用降低，同时在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在长视频编辑中优势更加明显，为高效视频处理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Motivation: 解决第一人称视角图像中物体分割标注数据稀缺的问题，利用廉价易得的叙述描述作为弱监督信号。

Method: 提出了WISH模型，通过从叙述中提取知识来学习合理的手-物体关联，实现无需测试时使用叙述的手部物体分割。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Ego4D数据集上的实验表明，WISH超越了所有基线方法，恢复了超过50%的全监督方法性能。

Conclusion: 叙述监督是一种有效的弱监督方法，能够显著减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，在手部物体分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: 提出了AgenticIQA框架，将视觉语言模型与传统IQA工具动态集成，通过分解IQA为四个子任务来提升图像质量评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应不同失真类型、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常分离处理。

Method: 采用模块化代理框架，包含规划器、执行器和总结器，将IQA分解为失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行四个子任务。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面均优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过动态、查询感知的方式整合VLMs和传统IQA工具，显著提升了图像质量评估的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的经验见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

Motivation: 传统二阶PDE模型在去噪早期阶段会产生块状伪影，需要开发更高阶的模型来改善这一问题。

Method: 构建四阶非线性PDE模型，扩散部分利用拉普拉斯算子和强度值指导，波动部分保留精细细节和纹理；对彩色图像独立处理每个通道。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI指标上均优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法，对灰度和彩色图像都取得更好效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面比现有模型表现更优，能有效减少伪影并保持图像细节。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP方法存在两个核心问题：基于联合的特征融合会携带不相关的背景细节，而全局余弦相似度缺乏解析细粒度语义关系的能力。

Method: SETR采用两阶段检索：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；重排序阶段使用适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上达到新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理为稳健和可移植的零样本组合图像检索提供了一个通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Method: 在预训练阶段使用OSM数据提供的多粒度学习信号，结合跨模态空间关联进行信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入；在下游任务中生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间关联在多模态地理空间数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

Conclusion: 基于补丁的视频超分辨率范式具有灵活性和高效性，能够突破基础模型分辨率的限制，实现高质量的大尺度视频增强。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Result: 在WILDS基准Camelyon17上相比最先进的OOD基线方法获得了一致的性能提升

Conclusion: 因果扰动作为可靠且可解释的泛化工具具有潜力

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

*Christoph Timmermann,Hyunse Lee,Woojin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决了CLIP在小样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现出色，但在小样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致的，使得直接图像比较不可靠。

Method: 提出轻量级SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法有闭式解，可通过多模态监督训练结合图像和文本对齐损失来优化投影。

Result: 训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体性能优于其他方法，特别是在低数据场景（1、2、4样本）中表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在小样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种轻量高效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性，通过轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道增强对前景-背景不匹配的检测能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操纵检测中表现优异，但在处理主要主体被错误放置到不合理背景的全局场景不一致时表现不佳

Method: 提出分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER原始预测融合

Result: SGS显著增强了对全局操纵的鲁棒性，改进了二元检测、定位和令牌级解释，且仅需推理阶段，计算开销可忽略

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了DGM4数据集，新增5000个包含前景-背景不匹配及其与文本操作混合的高质量样本，创建了DGM4+基准数据集，用于测试多模态模型在全局推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和标题更改），而现实世界伪造中普遍存在全局不一致性（如前景与背景不匹配），这一关键空白需要填补。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1生成以人为中心的新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并在三种条件下生成标题：字面意义、文本属性和文本分割，形成三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种操作类别的5000个高质量样本，通过质量控制管道确保数据质量，建立了DGM4+基准数据集。

Conclusion: 通过引入全局操作，DGM4+扩展补充了现有数据集，为测试多模态模型在局部和全局推理方面的能力提供了资源，有助于改进像HAMMER这样当前在处理FG-BG不一致性方面存在困难的模型。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at
https://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于主纤维束截面概念的几何学习方法，用于在分类任务中消除对称性影响，避免数据增强，构建更可持续的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉和医学应用中的数据集通常包含对称性（如旋转、缩放等），传统方法使用数据增强来学习这些对称性，但这种方法效率低下且不具可持续性。

Method: 使用主纤维束的截面概念来模出对称性，通过简单的度量来测量对称群作用下对象轨道之间的差异，并可优化截面以最大化类别分离。

Result: 在包含平移、旋转、缩放和重参数化对称性的对象轮廓数据集上验证了该方法，提出了包含恒定速度参数化作为特例的2参数规范参数化族。

Conclusion: 该方法基于几何概念，具有广泛的应用潜力，为处理对称性问题提供了更优雅和可持续的解决方案。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用基础模型生成3D伪标签的方法，替代传统计算成本高的自监督学习技术，显著提升语义占据预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法如新视角合成、跨视图渲染等计算成本高、内存占用大，且难以迁移到其他架构。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪地面真值标签，并利用时序信息进行标签稠密化。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型中mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（提升45%）；EasyOcc模型达到13.86 mIoU；在全场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择在自监督学习的全面场景理解中至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点球经常决定冠军归属，但守门员必须在极短时间内从细微的生物力学线索中预判踢球者意图

Method: 采用双分支架构：MobileNetV2 CNN提取RGB帧空间特征，2D关键点通过带注意力机制的LSTM网络处理，基于距离的阈值方法分割输入序列

Result: 在755个点球事件数据集上测试，准确率89%，比仅视觉和仅姿态基线高出14-22%，推理时间22毫秒

Conclusion: 轻量级且可解释的设计适用于守门员训练、战术分析和实时比赛分析

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

TL;DR: Reason-3D是一个基于大型推理模型的文本到场景生成方法，通过集成物体检索和布局约束来解决复杂几何和对象变换问题，在视觉保真度、约束遵循和资产检索质量方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何和对象变换时存在困难，对复杂指令的遵循能力较弱，需要改进场景合成的准确性和质量。

Method: 使用大型推理模型进行物体检索（涵盖物理、功能和上下文属性），基于隐式和显式布局约束放置物体，并通过碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在人类评分的视觉保真度、约束遵循和资产检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: Reason-3D不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域的发展，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，同时发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成质量好，但推理速度慢且存在训练-推理差异。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础

Method: 从信息论角度分析扩散模型推理过程，提出条件熵优化方法EVODiff，通过优化条件方差来最小化转换和重构误差

Result: 在CIFAR-10上10次函数评估时重构误差降低45.5%，ImageNet-256上函数评估次数减少25%，文本到图像生成质量提升且伪影减少

Conclusion: 信息论视角为扩散模型推理提供了新理论基础，EVODiff方法在减少计算成本的同时显著提升生成质量，优于现有最先进方法

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于视觉自回归模型(VAR)的主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略实现高效、高质量的主题驱动图像生成，解决了现有方法在效率和零样本能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主题驱动生成方法存在明显权衡：要么依赖计算昂贵的逐主题微调，牺牲效率和零样本能力；要么使用基于扩散模型的架构，但推理速度缓慢。VAR模型以其快速采样速度和强大生成质量而闻名，是解决这一矛盾的理想但未被充分探索的基础。

Method: EchoGen采用双路径注入策略，将主题的高级语义身份与低级细节解耦。使用语义编码器提取主题的抽象身份，通过解耦交叉注意力注入以指导整体构图；同时使用内容编码器捕捉复杂视觉细节，通过多模态注意力机制集成以确保高保真纹理和结构保留。

Result: 定量和定性结果证实了设计有效性，EchoGen在主题保真度和图像质量方面与最先进的基于扩散的方法相当，但采样延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: EchoGen是首个基于VAR模型的前馈主题驱动框架，成功解决了主题驱动生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题，为快速、高质量的主题驱动图像生成提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EntroPE，一种基于熵引导的动态补丁编码器，通过信息论准则动态检测时间序列中的过渡点来构建补丁边界，解决了传统固定补丁方法破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的时间序列预测方法采用时间无关的补丁构建策略，任意起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分割自然过渡点，干扰短期依赖关系并削弱表示学习。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器(EDP)使用信息论准则定位自然时间变化点并确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器(APE)使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。这些嵌入由全局Transformer处理以建模补丁间动态。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面都有所提升，证明了熵引导动态补丁方法在时间序列建模中的有效性。

Conclusion: 熵引导动态补丁为时间序列建模提供了一个有前景的新范式，能够保持时间结构同时保留补丁方法的计算优势。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image

generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,

Conclusion: Human-MME基准测试为MLLMs在人类中心图像理解方面的研究提供了更全面的评估框架，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

TL;DR: 本文首次在自动驾驶行人检测中进行了全面的姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，且下半身关节遮挡对检测率的影响比上半身和头部更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人检测在自动驾驶中至关重要，虽然许多检测模型致力于降低漏检率并处理遮挡和远距离识别等挑战，但公平性仍然是一个未被充分探索但同样重要的问题。

Method: 系统研究行人姿态变化（包括腿部状态、肘部状态和身体方向）以及单个关节遮挡对检测性能的影响，评估了5个行人专用检测器和3个通用模型，使用ECP-DP数据集，通过EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 发现检测器对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的行人存在偏见，下半身关节遮挡对检测率的负面影响比上半身和头部更大。Cascade R-CNN实现了最低的总体漏检率，并在所有属性中表现出最小的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首次在自动驾驶行人检测中进行的全面姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了检测器在特定姿态和遮挡条件下的偏见问题，为改进公平性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose--including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation--as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

*Walid Houmaidi,Youssef Sabiri,Fatima Zahra Iguenfer,Amine Abouaomar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriGen是一个用于计算机视觉中自动化细粒度多属性标注的新框架，特别针对细胞显微镜图像，通过双模型架构实现细胞类型分类和多属性分类，达到94.62%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类研究较少，需要开发自动化方法来提高标注效率和模型可解释性。

Method: 使用双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类，基于PBC数据集（8种细胞类型）和WBCAtt数据集（11种形态属性）。

Result: 实现了94.62%的多属性分类准确率，显著提高了模型可解释性，相比传统人工标注节省了大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了新的范式，可以扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务，有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GSDD方法，使用2D高斯基元进行数据集蒸馏，通过稀疏表示减少冗余，在相同存储预算下提高数据集多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据集蒸馏方法使用密集像素级表示，存在冗余且难以扩展。需要更高效的表示方法来减少计算和存储负担。

Method: 基于2D高斯基元的稀疏表示方法，仅用少量高斯基元编码关键判别信息，使用CUDA-based splatting算子进行并行推理和训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到最先进性能，同时保持高效的编码和解码成本。

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法，通过稀疏表示显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何为视频摘要结果生成可信的文本解释，通过集成大型多模态模型LLaVA-OneVision来创建视觉解释的文本描述，并提出基于语义重叠的评估方法来衡量解释的可信度。

Conclusion: 通过提出的可信度评估方法，能够有效识别最合适的文本解释生成方法，为视频摘要系统提供更符合人类期望的解释能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MGCE框架解决广义类别发现问题，通过多粒度概念专家和动态概念对比学习，自动估计未标注数据的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个主要局限：未能利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，以及假设训练时已知未标注类别数量，这在真实场景中不切实际。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习（DCCL）交替进行概念挖掘和双级表示学习；多粒度专家协作学习（MECL）引入不同粒度的专家并使用概念对齐矩阵进行跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上的实验表明，MGCE达到最先进结果，特别是在新类别准确率方面。即使没有类别数量先验知识，MGCE也比需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标注数据中的类别数量，适用于实际开放世界设置，通过多粒度概念挖掘和专家协作显著提升了广义类别发现的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is
available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/MGCE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMG是一种无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐框架，通过MLLM识别错位、隐式对齐器操纵扩散条件特征、以及迭代更新偏好目标来实现图像与提示的精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型生成图像与输入提示之间的多模态对齐问题，现有方法要么依赖有限的高质量偏好数据，要么通过编辑局部区域可能损害整体图像质量。

Method: 1) 使用多模态大语言模型识别错位；2) 隐式对齐器操纵扩散条件特征以减少错位并实现重新生成；3) 将重新对齐目标转化为可训练的迭代更新偏好目标。

Result: 在SDXL、SDXL-DPO和FLUX上的广泛定性和定量评估表明，IMG优于现有对齐方法，并且可以作为灵活的即插即用适配器增强先前的微调对齐方法。

Conclusion: IMG提供了一种有效且无需额外数据或编辑操作的多模态对齐解决方案，显著提升了扩散模型生成图像与提示的对齐精度。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉丰富文档理解模型如Donut虽然有效，但计算成本过高，不适合实时或资源受限的应用场景，需要模型压缩解决方案。

Method: 利用机制可解释性驱动知识蒸馏过程中的学生模型架构设计，通过分析内部计算识别关键子组件，决定哪些组件需要保留、近似、跳过或重新参数化。

Result: 开发的Donut-MINT模型在DocVQA基准测试中保持强大性能的同时，显著减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将模型压缩重新定义为电路发现过程，架起了可解释性研究与实用视觉语言模型部署之间的桥梁。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LAMs存在两个瓶颈：1）端到端训练的图像编码器空间理解能力差；2）输入帧间隔较大时模型脆弱，时间感知有限。这些问题阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模；进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的多个VLA任务上验证，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision- Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action rep- resentations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry- aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end- to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates
structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly
reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and
interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation
and real- world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results
demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry- aware modeling, temporal
coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 深度伪造检测面临高质量数据集稀缺的问题，多模态大语言模型在检测中表现不佳，常产生与视觉证据不符或幻觉的解释。

Method: 构建了带推理标注的深度伪造检测数据集，并提出段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO大幅提升检测准确率，获得4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，在测试条件下显著优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据对于实现更可靠和可解释的深度伪造检测至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换(CAT)方法，用于改善低比特后训练量化的精度问题，通过聚类特定参数对齐量化输出与全精度输出，无需微调模型或量化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的仿射变换在低比特后训练量化中会导致精度下降，因为统一的仿射参数无法有效处理所有输出，需要更精细的参数调整策略。

Method: 提出聚类仿射变换(CAT)，使用聚类特定的参数来对齐低比特量化输出与全精度输出，仅需少量额外参数，无需模型或量化参数微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K数据集上，该方法在多种架构和低比特设置下均优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18上达到53.18% Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT框架有效解决了低比特后训练量化的精度问题，通过聚类特定的仿射参数显著提升量化模型性能，且易于集成到现有PTQ方法中。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as

AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3是一个用于点监督定向目标检测的弱监督方法，通过渐进式标签分配和先验引导动态掩码损失来解决现有方法中伪标签利用率低和质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点监督方法存在两个缺陷：伪标签利用率低和伪标签质量差。为了替代成本高昂的人工标注，需要开发更有效的弱监督定向目标检测方法。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在不同训练阶段动态估计实例大小，实现标签分配方法的使用。2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合SAM模型和分水岭算法优势，克服各自在稀疏和密集场景中的性能缺陷。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在目标尺寸变化大或稀疏场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法，在稀疏和密集场景中均实现了优异性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D视频傅里叶场的连续时空视频超分辨率方法，通过神经编码器预测傅里叶系数，实现任意时空位置的灵活采样和抗混叠重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频表示为分离的时空组件，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。本文旨在开发一种连续、时空一致的视频表示方法。

Method: 将视频编码为连续的3D视频傅里叶场，使用具有大时空感受野的神经编码器预测傅里叶基系数，并包含高斯点扩散函数确保任意尺度的抗混叠重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在广泛的放大因子范围内，比现有基线提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，同时计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了时空超分辨率性能，3D视频傅里叶场表示能够同时捕捉精细空间细节和平滑时间动态，实现灵活采样和高质量重建。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

### [105] [SQUARE: Semantic Query-Augmented Fusion and Efficient Batch Reranking for Training-free Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26330)
*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排序来准确捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性，需要提升检索质量。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 语义查询增强融合阶段，用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富CLIP等VLM的查询嵌入；2) 高效批量重排序阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，在零样本组合图像检索任务中展现出强大性能和应用潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为MNAME的奖励模型，通过大规模人工标注数据集训练，解决了开源图像编辑模型缺乏可靠奖励模型的问题。该模型在多个基准测试中表现优异，并能用于筛选高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源图像编辑模型因缺乏可靠奖励模型而落后于闭源模型，这限制了高质量合成训练数据的扩展。

Method: 构建了包含20万对人工标注偏好数据的大规模数据集，训练了MNAME奖励模型，并使用该模型从现有噪声数据集中筛选高质量子集。

Result: MNAME在GenAI-Bench、AURORA-Bench、ImagenHub等基准测试中达到最先进的人类相关性，使用其筛选数据训练的Step1X-Edit模型相比完整数据集训练有显著提升。

Conclusion: MNAME作为奖励模型能有效扩展高质量图像编辑训练数据，具有强化学习后训练和测试时扩展等高级应用潜力，将公开发布以帮助社区构建更多高质量数据集。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Task-oriented Temporal Grounding (ToTG)新问题，构建ToTG Bench基准，开发TimeScope框架通过渐进推理在长视频中定位关键时刻，并在ToTG Pile数据集上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别长视频中的关键时刻对下游理解和推理任务至关重要，但传统方法在处理长视频时泛化能力有限且面临挑战。

Method: 提出TimeScope框架，采用渐进推理方法：首先在长视频中识别粗粒度时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼该范围。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下始终优于现有时间定位方法和流行的MLLMs。

Conclusion: TimeScope在解决这一新挑战性问题方面表现出色，突显了其有效性。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

*Harold Haodong Chen,Xianfeng Wu,Wen-Jie Shu,Rongjin Guo,Disen Lan,Harry Yang,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专门为基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵作为新信号，在配置文件和策略两个层级进行自适应优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法在视觉自回归模型中依赖频繁的部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适用于基于next-token预测的图像生成，因为中间解码结果具有固有的不完整性。

Method: ScalingAR利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，在配置文件层级融合内在和条件信号流式传输校准的置信状态，在策略层级利用该状态自适应终止低置信度轨迹并动态调度指导以调整条件强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%；高效减少62.0%的视觉token消耗同时优于基线；在挑战性场景中将性能下降缓解26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功填补了测试时缩放在基于next-token预测的自回归图像生成中的空白，通过创新的熵信号和双层级自适应机制实现了显著的性能提升和效率优化。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出PANDA，一种基于多模态大语言模型的智能AI工程师，用于通用视频异常检测，无需训练数据或人工干预即可处理任何场景和异常类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和人工调整，在新场景和未见异常类型上泛化能力有限且成本高昂，因此需要实现无需训练和人工参与的通用异常检测。

Method: 开发了四种关键能力：自适应的场景感知策略规划、目标驱动的启发式推理、工具增强的自我反思、自我改进的记忆链机制，包括场景感知RAG、潜在异常引导的启发提示、渐进式反思机制和记忆链。

Result: 大量实验表明PANDA在多场景、开放集和复杂场景设置中无需训练和人工参与即可达到最先进性能，验证了其通用和鲁棒的异常检测能力。

Conclusion: PANDA成功实现了通用视频异常检测，能够自动处理各种场景和异常类型，为视频异常检测领域提供了无需训练和人工干预的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

TL;DR: 提出了MotionRAG框架，通过检索增强方法从参考视频中提取运动先验，提升图像到视频生成的动态真实性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模物理约束、物体交互和特定领域动态

Method: 采用检索增强框架，包含检索管道提取高级运动特征、上下文学习进行运动适应的因果变换器架构、注意力机制的运动注入适配器

Result: 在多个领域和基础模型上实现显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略，模块化设计支持零样本泛化到新领域

Conclusion: 通过有效检索和转移运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像难度感知的超分辨率模型评估方法，使用高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来预测模型在困难图像上的表现差异，弥补了传统平均评分方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率模型评估使用平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，也无法捕捉某些模型在困难图像上产生的伪影问题。

Method: 提出了两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测测试图像中模型视觉效果的显著差异，并开发了相应的评估方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分在平均性能接近但视觉效果不同的超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: 基于图像难度感知的评估方法能够更准确地反映超分辨率模型的真实性能，特别是在困难图像上的表现差异。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架，通过三阶段渐进式网络（CENet、SFNet、RNet）结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模型，实现多尺度特征聚合和空间语义建模，有效去除雨纹并保持图像结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度图像去雨模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在不足，需要更有效的多尺度特征聚合和空间语义建模方法。

Method: 使用三阶段渐进式框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba进行频率融合，RNet通过原始分辨率子网络恢复细粒度结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得了与最新去雨方法相竞争的结果，能够有效学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式多阶段设计和混合域建模，显著提升了图像去雨的质量和效果。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了QuaRTZ方法，一种用于扩散模型的4位后训练量化方案，通过残差截断和零抑制技术，在保持纹理细节的同时实现高效量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高，部署困难。4位量化由于步长较大，会放大低幅度激活值的舍入误差，导致纹理细节丢失。

Method: QuaRTZ采用8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，然后通过前导零抑制压缩到4位，保留最低有效位(LSB)以保护纹理细节。

Result: 4位QuaRTZ在FLUX.1-schnell上达到FID 6.98，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过平衡异常值保留和LSB精度，有效减少舍入误差，提高量化效率，适用于各种激活分布。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Motivation: 确保现代生产线上的每辆车都符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷是一个日益复杂的挑战，需要自动化解决方案来替代人工检测。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度全景，将任务特定视图路由到专门模块：YOLOv8用于零件检测、EfficientNet用于ICE/EV分类、Gemini-1.5 Flash用于标志OCR、YOLOv8-Seg用于划痕和凹陷分割，通过视图感知融合层标准化证据，VIN条件规则引擎将检测特征与预期清单进行比较。

Result: 在混合OEM车辆数据集上，AVI达到93%的验证准确率、86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持3.3辆车/分钟的处理速度，大幅超过单视角或无分割基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在工业可部署的汽车环境中统一多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测的公开报告系统，证明了其在实际生产环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个用于3D风格迁移的单次前向3D高斯框架，能够在无姿态输入（从单张图像到多视角集合）的情况下，根据参考风格图像生成风格化的3D高斯场景，无需逐场景优化或预计算姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D风格迁移方法通常需要逐场景优化或预计算姿态，限制了其应用范围。Stylos旨在实现无需这些约束的零样本3D风格迁移，能够泛化到未见过的类别、场景和风格。

Method: 采用Transformer主干网络，包含两个路径：几何预测路径使用自注意力保持几何保真度，风格注入路径通过全局交叉注意力确保视角间视觉一致性。此外，提出了基于体素的3D风格损失，将聚合的场景特征与风格统计对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，证明了全局风格-内容耦合、提出的3D风格损失以及框架从单视角到大规模多视角设置的可扩展性的有效性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过创新的架构设计和损失函数，实现了无需逐场景优化的3D风格迁移，在保持几何保真度的同时确保视角一致的风格化效果，具有良好的泛化能力和可扩展性。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

Motivation: 解决室内场景分类的挑战性，特别是在敏感内容分析（如儿童性虐待图像分类）中需要可解释性和隐私保护的需求

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件之间的交互关系

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%平衡准确率，超越基于图像的方法；在真实世界CSAI评估中获得74.27%平衡准确率

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和CSAI分类的强大范式，具有可解释性和隐私保护优势

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CBAM-CNN模型用于槟榔叶病害分类，模型仅2.13M参数，在10,185张图像数据集上达到95.58%准确率，优于传统预训练CNN模型。

Motivation: 槟榔叶作为重要经济作物易受病害威胁，传统方法难以及时识别病害造成经济损失，人工智能技术可帮助提高产量和病害预测。

Method: 构建轻量级CBAM-CNN模型，集成卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)增强特征关注，使用包含健康叶、叶腐病和叶斑病三个类别的10,185张图像数据集，采用Grad-CAM进行可视化解释。

Conclusion: 提出的CBAM-CNN模型在槟榔叶病害分类中表现优异，轻量级设计适合实际应用，注意力机制有效提升特征识别能力，为作物病害智能诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoGuide方法，从用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如房屋平面图），通过对比学习在嵌入空间中定义似然分数，解决了传统方法中路径规划过程不可逆、不可微的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从移动轨迹重建空间布局是一个病态逆问题，因为多个平面图可能对应相同的移动轨迹。现有生成逆求解器面临路径规划过程不可逆、不可微的挑战，导致似然分数优化不稳定。

Method: 采用扩散模型后验采样器，在对比学习训练的嵌入空间中重新定义更平滑的似然分数，使兼容的平面图和轨迹在嵌入空间中靠近，不匹配的则远离。

Result: CoGuide模型在广泛实验中生成与轨迹更一致的平面图，比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 在嵌入空间中定义代理似然分数是真实似然分数的有效近似，能够引导去噪过程趋向后验分布，解决了逆问题中的不稳定优化问题。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了感知影响力概念，系统分析了感知损失在低剂量CT图像增强中的设计选择，发现文献中广泛使用的配置表现不佳，并提供了改进的感知损失设计指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 感知损失在低剂量CT图像增强中比传统像素级损失表现更好，但其设计涉及关键但未被充分探索的决策，包括特征表示级别、预训练编码器数据集和感知分量的相对重要性。

Method: 引入感知影响力概念来量化感知损失项对总损失的相对贡献，提出原则性框架评估损失设计选择对模型训练性能的影响，通过系统实验比较不同配置。

Result: 研究表明，文献中广泛使用的感知损失配置表现不如精心设计的替代方案，更好的感知损失设计能显著改善重建CT图像的噪声降低和结构保真度，无需改变网络架构。

Conclusion: 提供了基于统计分析的目标指南，指导感知损失在低剂量CT去噪中的有效使用，证明感知损失设计的优化能带来显著性能提升。

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算成本高，不适合资源受限的边缘环境，需要开发高性能的小型模型，但仅预训练的小模型难以满足复杂任务需求。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调(SFT)和离线策略知识蒸馏的后训练流程，提升小型模型在边缘设备上的性能。

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下表现出强泛化能力，并在多种任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为在Ascend边缘设备上开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DEPTHOR++深度增强框架，通过合成数据训练、无参数异常检测和专用网络设计，显著提升轻量dToF传感器在现实场景中的深度感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度增强方法假设理想dToF输入和完美dToF-RGB对齐，忽略了现实中的校准误差和异常，限制了实际应用。

Method: 1) 基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2) 无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误dToF测量；3) 针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，整合RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能：ZJU-L5数据集RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；Mirror3D-NYU数据集镜面区域提升37%；Hammer数据集超越L515测量22%。

Conclusion: 该方法能显著提升低成本传感器的深度感知能力，使其超越高端设备，具有良好的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了Stable Cinemetrics评估框架，将专业视频生成控制分为四个层次化分类：场景设置、事件、灯光和摄像机，包含76个细粒度控制节点。通过大规模人类研究评估了10多个模型和2万多个视频，发现现有模型在事件和摄像机控制方面存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和要求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 引入四个解耦的层次化分类法（场景设置、事件、灯光、摄像机），构建专业用例对齐的提示基准，开发自动化提示分类和问题生成流程，进行大规模人类研究（80+电影专业人士标注20K+视频）。

Result: 即使最强的现有模型在事件和摄像机相关控制方面也表现出显著差距。训练了一个自动评估器，在专家标注对齐方面优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: SCINE是首个将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型背景下的方法，引入了以电影控制为中心的分类法，并通过结构化评估流程和详细分析指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效自动化连接组学中的校对工作，大幅降低人工成本，为大规模连接组重建和比较连接组学提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够根据任意新的焦点和模糊程度对现有图像进行灵活重新对焦，解决了传统摄影中景深效果固定且难以修改的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影中的景深效果一旦创建就难以修改，当主体失焦时会产生不理想的模糊效果。需要一种能够灵活调整图像对焦点和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 设计了基于扩散变换器的重新对焦学习框架，通过模拟管道生成大规模不同焦点平面和散景级别的图像对数据，并在训练中引入堆叠约束来确保精确的景深操作。

Result: DiffCamera能够在各种场景下实现稳定的重新对焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供了前所未有的景深调整控制能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理基础的约束训练，实现了与场景结构和相机条件精确对齐的重新对焦效果，支持广泛的景深调整应用。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制能力，无法在专业Foley工作流中优先处理特定对象，导致生成不必要的背景声音或关注错误对象。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，提出SAGANet多模态生成模型，利用视觉分割掩码结合视频和文本线索进行可控音频生成。

Result: 相比当前最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割映射实现了细粒度和视觉定位的音频控制，推动了分割感知Foley研究的发展。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

TL;DR: Hy-Facial是一个混合特征提取框架，结合深度学习和传统图像处理技术，通过UMAP降维实现83.3%的人脸表情识别准确率。

Motivation: 人脸表情分类面临高维度和复杂性的挑战，需要融合多种特征提取方法并解决特征冗余问题。

Method: 融合VGG19深度特征与SIFT、ORB手工特征，使用K-means聚类和UMAP进行降维处理。

Result: 在FER数据集上达到83.3%的分类准确率，UMAP被证明是最有效的降维方法。

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景图像具有完整的视野，但面临数据稀缺导致泛化能力差，以及球面畸变导致传统方法效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出数据增强引擎从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建了约607K个全景RGB-深度对；设计SphereViT模型利用球面坐标增强几何一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最先进性能，AbsRel指标比最强零样本基线平均提升38%，甚至超越之前的域内方法，且效率更高。

Conclusion: DA²是一个准确、零样本泛化能力强、完全端到端的全景深度估计器，解决了全景深度估计的关键挑战。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

TL;DR: HART是一个用于稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中输出水密着装网格、对齐的SMPL-X人体网格和高斯溅射表示，用于照片级真实感新视角渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板（忽略了宽松服装和人物-物体交互），要么在简化的相机假设下训练隐函数，限制了在真实场景中的适用性。

Method: HART预测逐像素3D点图、法线和身体对应关系，并采用遮挡感知的泊松重建来恢复完整几何，即使是在自遮挡区域。这些预测还与参数化SMPL-X身体模型对齐，确保重建几何与人体结构一致，同时捕捉宽松服装和交互。这些人体对齐网格初始化高斯溅射以支持稀疏视角渲染。

Result: 仅在2.3K合成扫描上训练，HART取得了最先进的结果：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离改进18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V下降6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS降低15-27%。

Conclusion: 结果表明前馈变换器可以作为在真实世界设置中进行鲁棒人体重建的可扩展模型。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

### [130] [Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631)
*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了第一个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计使模型对姿态和尺度变化具有不变性，从而在无预对齐的真实数据上实现鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法依赖预对齐到规范坐标系，这会泄露姿态和尺度线索，导致模型记忆绝对位置而非推理内在几何结构。当真实数据缺乏对齐时性能会崩溃。

Method: 设计SIM(3)-等变网络架构，包含模块化层：特征规范化、相似不变几何推理、原始坐标系恢复。采用去偏评估协议消除隐藏线索。

Result: 在PCN基准测试中优于等变和数据增强基线；在KITTI上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D上Chamfer距离降低14%；在严格协议下仍优于竞争对手在偏置设置下的表现。

Conclusion: 完整的SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的视觉惯性SLAM数据集和基准测试，专门针对头戴式设备的自我中心数据，解决了现有基准测试在运动多样性、动态视觉内容和长时间会话等方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM基准测试无法充分反映头戴式设备面临的挑战，如更广泛的运动和视角变化、普遍的动态视觉内容、受时变传感器校准影响的长会话等，且缺乏足够精确的地面真实位姿。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心的小时级和公里级轨迹，配备多种传感器，并利用测量工具获取厘米级精度的控制点作为间接位姿标注。

Result: 实验表明，学术界开发的最先进系统无法应对这些挑战，并识别了导致这种情况的组件。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为评估视觉惯性SLAM系统在真实头戴式设备场景下的性能提供了可靠的平台，并设计了不同难度级别的轨迹以便深入分析。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

*Yuxin Song,Wenkai Dong,Shizun Wang,Qi Zhang,Song Xue,Tao Yuan,Hu Yang,Haocheng Feng,Hang Zhou,Xinyan Xiao,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext是一种连接视觉语言模型和扩散模型的新方法，通过多模态"kontext"实现生成推理与高质量视觉合成的分离，在文本到图像生成和编辑任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成能力内在纠缠，限制了模型性能。需要将复杂的生成推理能力委托给强大的视觉语言模型，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力。

Method: 提出Query-Kontext方法，通过包含语义线索和粗粒度图像条件的多模态"kontext"连接VLM和扩散模型。采用三阶段渐进训练策略：首先连接VLM与轻量扩散头，然后扩展到预训练扩散模型，最后引入低级图像编码器进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明，该方法与强大的统一基线方法相当，在某些情况下甚至优于特定任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功地将多模态生成推理与高质量视觉合成分离，在多种多模态参考到图像场景中表现出色，为统一多模态模型提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在准确捕捉空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）方面存在持续挑战，且随着架构演进，早期位置控制方法已与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 通过自动生成边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象，然后无缝拼接在一起；利用特定注意力头捕获必要信息，在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型性能：FLUX在GenEval位置任务上提升218%，在PosEval上提升206%；Qwen-Image在PosEval上比先前模型提升54%。

Conclusion: Stitch实现了无需训练的位置控制集成，在保持视觉吸引力的同时提高了空间准确性，在位置基础的文本到图像生成方面达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: 本文提出TTT3R方法，通过测试时训练视角改进3D重建基础模型，使用对齐置信度推导闭式学习率来平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应，显著提升长度泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中表现出色，但超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，存在长度泛化限制。

Method: 从测试时训练角度重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计为在线学习问题，利用记忆状态与输入观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率进行内存更新。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，全局姿态估计比基线提升2倍，以20FPS运行仅需6GB GPU内存处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: 提出的训练无关干预方法TTT3R有效解决了3D重建中的长度泛化问题，在保持高效性的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

### [135] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试消除DistilGPT-2的欺骗概念，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，但每次尝试都会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究不良行为（如欺骗）是否是局部化功能可以被移除，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入"循环消融"方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，试图消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型能通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），但每次消融都导致语言性能逐渐下降（困惑度上升）。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布式和纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 该论文通过证明内部模型表示的几何特性可作为评估生成文本质量的可靠代理，将大语言模型的内部分析与外部分析方法联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥接大语言模型的内部分析和外部分析方法，寻找无需人工标注数据集的文本质量评估方法。

Method: 验证了一组在LLM不同层测量的度量指标，包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、内在维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数。

Result: 发现内在维度和有效秩可作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对来自各种来源的文本进行一致排序。

Conclusion: 这些几何度量反映了文本的内在特征而非模型特定伪影，实现了无需参考的文本质量评估，为自动化评估流程提供实用优势。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的管道，通过生成价值冲突场景来测试模型的价值排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，而实际部署中LLM助手经常需要在不同价值间做出权衡。

Method: 自动生成价值冲突场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示来测试目标模型，通过自由文本响应评估模型的价值排序。

Result: 模型在开放式评估中从保护性价值转向个人价值；在系统提示中加入详细价值排序可将对齐度提升14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型价值排序能力很重要，系统提示能在价值冲突中适度改善LLM行为对齐，为未来研究提供基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

TL;DR: 提出了思考监督奖励模型（TRM），通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，解决开放领域问答中RLVR难以验证正确性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR在数学和编程等可验证领域表现良好，但在开放领域问答中难以可靠评估正确性。现有方法过度关注与支持文档的语义对齐（忠实度），导致模型过度依赖外部知识而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: TRM模型首先评估每个答案句子与支持文档的忠实度，然后通过推理步骤评估句子级正确性，将奖励建模结构化为忠实度、推理和正确性评估的序列。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提高了错误句子的识别能力，将TRM纳入策略优化后在答案正确性和实用性方面都取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过引入批判性思维监督，使模型能够更好地评估和利用外部与内部知识，有效提升了开放领域问答的性能。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提高30.4%，在事实性上提高16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提高了声明级生成的效率和质量。

Conclusion: SimulRAG通过科学模拟器检索有效缓解了大语言模型在长格式科学问答中的幻觉问题，显著提升了回答的信息量和事实性，为科学领域的可信AI应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻采编任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含幻觉，其中Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的3倍。主要问题是解释性过度自信而非虚构实体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在新闻工作流程中应用日益增多，但其幻觉倾向威胁新闻业的核心实践——来源、归属和准确性，需要评估这些工具在真实报道任务中的表现。

Method: 使用300份TikTok诉讼和政策相关文档作为语料库，对三种工具进行报道式任务测试，变化提示语具体性和上下文大小，使用分类法对句子级输出进行标注以测量幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约40%，是NotebookLM(13%)的3倍。大多数错误不是虚构实体或数字，而是解释性过度自信——模型添加未经支持的来源描述，将归属意见转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: LLMs与新闻业存在根本认识论不匹配：新闻要求每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本。需要新闻业特定的幻觉分类扩展和强制准确归属的架构，而非优化流畅性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言ASR模型的解码器进行细粒度分析，发现高资源语言在正确token排名、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好，而低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，且子token使用模式存在聚类差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索端到端多语言ASR模型内部机制，特别是跨语言公平性和有效性的问题，现有研究对此关注不足。

Method: 通过追踪beam搜索路径，捕获子token假设及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子token使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言正确token排名更高、置信度更高、预测熵更低、候选更多样；低资源语言表现较差，子token使用呈现受语言类型影响的聚类模式。

Conclusion: 子token探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，为改善语音技术不平衡发展提供了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个开源预训练语料库，采用风险缓解策略构建，结合公共领域和许可文本，在多个基准测试中表现优于其他许可数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在最小化法律风险的同时提供强大的模型性能，减少对无差别网络抓取的依赖。

Method: 采用多阶段管道进行许可感知过滤、安全和质量筛选、领域感知混合，结合公共领域文本、许可文本、政府作品和欧盟TDM合格来源。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数规模的实验中，MixtureVitae训练的模型在数学/代码任务上表现突出，在QA任务上具有竞争力，接近DCLM性能。

Conclusion: 基于许可优先、风险缓解的数据为训练有能力的LLM提供了实用且法律上缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的前提下减少对网络抓取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [145] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性偏差来校准置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性来改善置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在错误校准问题，经常在低准确率实例上报告高置信度，损害信任和安全。研究发现这种过度自信源于LLM对信息量较少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并基于总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。同时利用生成器-验证器不一致性，结合基于一致性的生成器置信度估计来进一步改善校准。

Result: DINCO提供了更少饱和且更可用的置信度估计，在10次推理调用下的表现优于100次调用的自一致性方法，采样本身无法弥补DINCO与基线方法之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补连贯性维度，有效解决了LLM置信度校准问题，提供了更可靠和可用的置信度估计。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励评分标准的强化学习框架，用于提升大语言模型在开放端推理任务中的性能，通过模型自身作为评分者和生成基于评分标准的奖励信号来改进推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在HealthBench研究中发现，使用模型自身作为评分者并生成基于评分标准的奖励信号能显著提升推理性能，且训练后的模型也成为更强的评分者。

Method: 引入了自我奖励评分标准强化学习框架，这是一种轻量级框架，能够实现更快、更资源高效的训练，并超越基线方法。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B模型上，仅使用4000个样本的HealthBench Easy子集进行训练，就足以获得一个在HealthBench Hard上超过GPT-5的模型。加入少量教师评分数据能进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在开放端推理任务中表现出色，能够高效提升模型性能，特别是在资源受限的情况下仍能取得显著成果。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: PB-RLSVR框架通过使用高性能英语LLM作为枢轴模型生成参考响应，然后基于多语言模型响应与英语参考的语义等价性进行奖励，有效提升了多语言推理能力，无需目标语言的人工标注数据。


<details>

Motivation: 解决强化学习在大型语言模型中主要局限于英语的问题，缩小不同语言间的性能差距，构建真正的多语言推理智能体。

Method: 采用基于枢轴的强化学习方法，使用英语LLM生成参考响应，通过跨语言语义奖励函数（包括基于嵌入和机器翻译的方法）来评估多语言模型的语义等价性。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B上分别实现了16.41%和10.17%的多语言性能平均提升，显著优于传统PPO基线方法。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR提供了一种强大且数据高效的方法，能够有效缩小英语与其他语言之间的推理性能差距，为构建真正的多语言推理智能体提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究儿童在4岁前频繁省略主语的现象，验证Orfitelli和Hyams关于儿童混淆祈使句与陈述句导致临时空主语语法的假说

Method: 提出新的计算参数衡量误解程度，使用修改版变分学习器（适用于超集-子集语言）进行强制主语语法学习的模拟

Result: 模拟结果支持Orfitelli和Hyams的假说，儿童确实会因混淆祈使句与陈述句而发展出临时空主语语法

Conclusion: 本研究为将计算模型整合到语法习得研究中提供了框架，同时考虑了其他关键发展因素

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ元评估方法在机器翻译评估中的局限性，提供更稳健的评估指标。

Method: PDP是一种基于相关性的指标，利用成对差异而非原始分数，从所有段中提取信息以更好地理解分数分布，并使用段内成对差异来改进全局Pearson到段内分数比较。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务上的分析显示，PDP能正确排名哨兵评估指标，并与人类错误权重更好地对齐。噪声注入分析表明PDP对随机噪声、段偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一种有效的段级元评估指标，比先前方法更稳健且与人类判断更一致，但对极端异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率，探索实现风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率，通过偏好数据对齐模型到幽默和浪漫风格，确定实现风格饱和所需的最小数据量

Result: 定义了这些模型的性能极限，并确定了实现风格饱和所需的最小偏好数据量

Conclusion: 通过研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率，可以基准化模型的能力和限制，为风格化图像描述生成提供指导

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需显式过程奖励的奖励自由引导（RFG）方法，用于指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过参数化过程奖励为增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在解决复杂问题时需要逐步指导推理过程，但传统方法需要为每个中间步骤进行密集标注，这在dLLMs中具有挑战性，因为生成是任意顺序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG通过将过程奖励参数化为增强dLLM和参考dLLM的对数似然比来实现，其中增强模型可以通过任何现成的经过强化学习或监督微调后训练的dLLM获得。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上都取得了显著改进，准确率提升高达9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一个通用的无需训练框架，可以在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度之间映射的特性，证明了Transformer能够通过前推操作表示上下文映射，并且可以通用逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示。同时建立了Transformer与Vlasov方程解映射之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer架构处理任意大量上下文token的能力，从数学上统一分析其表达能力。将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射，可以应用于研究Wasserstein正则性、证明泛化界限以及分析相互作用粒子在通过网络时的动力学平均场极限。

Method: 将Transformer建模为概率测度之间的映射，通过前推操作表示上下文映射。分析了这类映射的特性，包括保持支撑基数不变和其Fréchet导数的正则部分一致连续。建立了Transformer与Vlasov方程解映射之间的对应关系。

Result: 完全刻画了能够通过前推操作以上下文映射表示的测度间映射的特性。证明了Transformer可以通用逼近具有任何连续上下文映射的表示。同时证明了Vlasov方程的解映射满足这些条件，因此可以被Transformer逼近；反之，测度理论自注意力机制的特性确保了无限深度、平均场测度理论Transformer可以与Vlasov流等同。

Conclusion: Transformer架构具有特定的数学特性，能够表示一类重要的测度间映射，并且与Vlasov方程描述的相互作用粒子系统的平均场动力学有着深刻的联系，这为理解Transformer的表达能力和理论基础提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构不仅通过发布文章直接影响公众认知，还通过选择报道哪些话题以及如何框架这些话题来塑造舆论。然而，大规模测量这些微妙形式的媒体偏见仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 开发了一个整合大型语言模型(LLMs)和可扩展、近实时新闻抓取的数据管道，提取结构化注释（包括政治倾向、语气、主题、文章类型和主要事件），每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 在多个层次（句子级、文章级、出版商级）量化了报道的各个维度，扩展了研究人员分析现代新闻环境中媒体偏见的方式。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复使用的大规模研究媒体偏见的方法论，为未来研究提供实证资源，并通过示例展示了该数据集如何揭示新闻覆盖和偏见中的有见地模式。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在魁北克法语语法现象上的语言知识，并与人类表现进行对比。

Method: 构建包含1,761对最小对立对的语料库，由12名母语者标注，通过比较LLMs为每对句子分配更高概率的比率来评估模型能力。

Result: 语法能力随模型规模扩展，但所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上持续失败，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在魁北克法语语法理解上存在局限性，特别是在语义理解方面，与人类能力有明显差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试的可靠性对模型评估和科学发展至关重要，现有基准可能存在某些子领域过度影响总体结果的问题，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 从分布角度研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多项选择基准和5个模型系列上分析各基准在和谐度均值-方差平面上的分布。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准会产生误导结果，例如ARC-Easy基准中生物概念问题过度主导，掩盖了地理、物理、化学等其他重要子领域。

Conclusion: 建议在模型评估时同时报告和谐度和准确率，从简单的性能平均转向更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏见方法会显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性等核心能力，而基于提示的方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中深层次刻板印象关联。

Method: 采用双路径遗忘机制，协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和各种评估基准上的实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见方面优于现有方法，同时保留了语言建模能力。去偏见权重可在模型变体间迁移。

Conclusion: 偏见表示在预训练期间固化，并在微调阶段持续存在。BiasUnlearn框架有效解决了语言模型中的偏见问题。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

TL;DR: LD-MoLE是一种可学习的动态路由机制，用于LoRA专家混合模型，通过可微分路由函数和闭式解替代传统TopK路由，实现自适应、令牌依赖和分层专家分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖传统TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，并为每个令牌分配固定数量的专家，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用可微分路由函数和闭式解替代非可微分的TopK选择，引入解析稀疏控制目标来正则化激活专家数量，实现自适应专家分配。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中获得了最高平均分数。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了优越性能，还展示了学习令牌依赖和分层专家分配的能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

TL;DR: 提出评估数学原子能力的新范式，将数学能力分解为领域特定能力和逻辑能力两个维度，通过实验探索不同原子能力之间的相互影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据规模和长思维链，但质疑LLMs是否真正掌握了数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记住了训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发。

Method: 将原子能力分为两个维度：(1)四个主要数学领域的特定能力：代数、几何、分析和拓扑；(2)不同层次的逻辑能力：概念理解、使用形式数学语言的前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理。为每个原子能力单元提出相应的训练和评估数据集。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示了许多有趣的发现，包括模型在各种原子能力上的不同表现以及原子能力之间的相互作用。

Conclusion: 将数学智能分解为原子组件的重要性，为模型认知提供新见解，并指导训练策略向更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗、社会服务和法律等高风险领域，文本匿名化对于负责任地开发和部署AI至关重要，需要平衡隐私保护与文本实用性。

Method: 引入实体感知控制代码，通过上下文学习或前缀调优实现可控生成。ICL变体确保与底层去识别系统一致的隐私级别，前缀调优变体采用自定义掩码策略和损失函数支持可扩展的高质量生成。

Result: 在法学和临床数据集上的实验表明，该方法在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Result: 大量实验和人工评估显示CATCH显著提升了AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法在保真度和决策逻辑方面的局限性

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based

three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个强化学习框架，通过三元奖励机制直接优化LLMs的真实性，显著减少幻觉并提高真实性，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时往往会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又可能过于保守，牺牲正确答案。这两种极端都会损害真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，采用三元奖励机制区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，激励模型不仅提供正确回答，还能在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性上都实现了强劲性能，强调了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于深度神经网络（DNN）和大型语言模型（LLMs）在抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，发现LLMs在性能表现和减少性别偏见方面优于DNN模型，但种族偏见问题仍然存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是调查语言模型在自动化抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，特别关注性别和种族/民族相关的社会人口统计学差异，以促进更公平的医疗AI应用。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ临床访谈语料库，比较DNN嵌入模型与LLMs的少样本学习方法。对DNN模型应用公平感知损失函数，对LLMs探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: LLMs在抑郁症分类性能上优于DNN模型，特别是在西班牙裔参与者等代表性不足群体中。LLMs表现出比DNN更低的性别偏见，但种族差异仍然存在。最差群体损失函数在DNN中实现了性能与公平性的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在抑郁症检测中具有更好的性能和公平性潜力，但种族偏见问题需要进一步解决。公平感知技术和伦理提示框架有助于减轻偏见，但增加样本数量对减少种族差异效果有限。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,

retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time

Motivation: 现有基于RLVR的大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，生成了过长的推理路径却无性能提升。现有的长度惩罚方法因轨迹级奖励与token级优化的不匹配而失败。

Method: 提出DECS框架：(1) 首创解耦的token级奖励机制，精确惩罚冗余token；(2) 新颖的课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效能。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，DECS实现了推理token数量减少超过50%，同时保持甚至提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型推理能力的前提下，实现推理效率的大幅提升。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

Motivation: 当用户无法看到视觉上下文时，视觉语言模型的解释可能误导用户相信错误的预测。需要解决用户对模型预测的过度依赖问题。

Method: 提出视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实度）和对比性（衡量解释区分模型预测与替代方案的能力）两种质量评分函数。

Result: 在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上，这些质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究表明，显示质量评分可将用户预测模型正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信错误预测的比例降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分有助于促进对视觉语言模型预测的适当依赖。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires

multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,

TL;DR: 评估Whisper模型在印尼爪哇语和巽他语ASR任务中的噪声鲁棒性，通过噪声增强训练提升模型在嘈杂环境下的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现有研究在干净环境下展示了强大的ASR性能，但在嘈杂环境中的有效性仍不明确，需要评估模型对噪声的鲁棒性

Method: 采用多种训练策略，包括合成噪声增强和SpecAugment，并在不同信噪比条件下评估性能

Result: 噪声感知训练显著提高了鲁棒性，特别是对于较大的Whisper模型。详细错误分析揭示了语言特定的挑战

Conclusion: 噪声感知训练能有效提升ASR模型在嘈杂环境下的性能，同时指出了未来改进的方向

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Whisper-based automatic speech recognition
(ASR) models for two major Indonesian regional languages: Javanese and
Sundanese. While recent work has demonstrated strong ASR performance under
clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments remains unclear. To
address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including
synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a
range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our results show that noise-aware
training substantially improves robustness, particularly for larger Whisper
models. A detailed error analysis further reveals language-specific challenges,
highlighting avenues for future improvements

*Jisu Shin,Hoyun Song,Juhyun Oh,Changgeon Ko,Eunsu Kim,Chani Jung,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RoleConflictBench基准，评估LLM在角色冲突情境中的上下文敏感性，发现LLM存在显著的社会角色偏见而非情境敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在人类决策中影响力增强，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社会困境，需要上下文敏感性。

Method: 使用三阶段流程生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统改变相关期望和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLM的选择。

Result: LLM对上下文线索有一定响应能力，但敏感性不足。决策主要受强大的固有社会角色偏见支配，而非情境信息。发现对家庭和职业角色的偏好，以及男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的优先选择。

Conclusion: LLM在角色冲突情境中表现出显著的社会角色偏见，上下文敏感性不足，需要改进模型以更好地处理复杂社会困境。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算高效的文本个性化质量评估方法PerQ，通过减少对大语言模型的依赖来降低元评估成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，研究者通常依赖大语言模型进行元评估，但多个模型的使用会增加成本

Method: 开发了PerQ方法，这是一种计算高效的文本个性化质量评估方法

Result: 通过大语言模型与小语言模型生成能力的案例研究，验证了PerQ指标在研究中具有实用性

Conclusion: PerQ方法能有效减少资源浪费，提高文本个性化质量评估的效率

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

TL;DR: Mem-alpha是一个强化学习框架，通过交互和反馈训练智能体有效管理复杂记忆系统，显著提升长期信息理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆的LLM智能体依赖预定义指令和工具进行记忆更新，但语言模型缺乏判断存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新的能力，导致记忆构建不优和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Mem-alpha强化学习框架，构建专门训练数据集，智能体处理序列信息块，学习提取和存储相关内容并更新记忆系统，奖励信号来自下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha在现有记忆增强智能体基线上取得显著改进，尽管仅在最多30k token的实例上训练，但能泛化到超过400k token的序列，超过训练长度的13倍。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架展示了强大的记忆管理能力，其训练方法使智能体能够有效处理远超训练长度的序列，证明了该方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为KERN的新型路由器函数，作为Softmax的替代方案，该函数基于Nadaraya-Watson回归的数学框架，能够泛化Sigmoid和Softmax路由器，并在MoE和LLM中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器评分函数，但这被认为是一种未经挑战的假设而非原则性设计选择。作者从Nadaraya-Watson回归的角度重新审视MoE，发现两者具有相同的数学公式，从而提出更优的路由器设计。

Method: 提出KERN（Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization）路由器函数，这是一种FFN风格的路由器，推荐使用ReLU激活和ℓ2归一化。该路由器无需额外成本，能够泛化现有的Sigmoid和Softmax路由器。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提出的FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器为MoE模型提供了一种有前景的Softmax替代方案，基于Nadaraya-Watson回归的理论框架，在保持性能的同时提供了更灵活的路由器设计选择。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种替代架构（如xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型和对抗学习）在序列标注任务中的表现，发现这些在语言建模中表现良好的架构在更复杂的结构化任务中泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但一些替代架构在语言建模中显示出潜力，然而这些架构在序列标注任务中的应用较少，特别是在复杂结构任务中的表现尚不清楚。

Method: 研究多种替代架构（xLSTMs、结构化状态空间模型、扩散模型、对抗学习）在不同结构复杂性、标签空间和标记依赖关系的标注任务中的适应性，并在多语言环境下进行评估。

Result: 发现在简单设置中观察到的强性能并不总能很好地跨语言或数据集泛化，也无法扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 替代架构在序列标注任务中的表现存在局限性，特别是在处理复杂结构化任务时，其泛化能力不如在语言建模中表现的那样出色。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

Motivation: 现有的无参考GEC评估指标虽然与人工评价相关性高，但无法有效评估旨在获取不合理高分的对抗系统，这会误导用户选择GEC系统，影响自动评估的可靠性。

Method: 为SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和基于LLM的四种无参考指标设计了对抗攻击策略，构建了专门的对抗系统。

Result: 开发的对抗系统在性能上超越了当前最先进的方法，成功暴露了现有评估指标的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明现有无参考GEC评估指标存在严重的安全漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的评估方法来确保自动评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，难以在RAG场景中准确评估回答的忠实性、相关性、适当拒绝、完整性和简洁性，缺乏专门的RAG偏好数据集和奖励模型。

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，优先考虑回答的准确性而非风格特征，训练参数规模从7B到24B的上下文奖励模型。

Result: 使用仅4K样本的小型偏好数据集训练的RAG专用奖励模型，在ContextualJudgeBench上达到SOTA性能，绝对提升15.5%，超越使用2.4M样本训练的70B+通用模型。

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效训练专门针对RAG场景的奖励模型，即使使用小规模数据集也能超越大规模通用模型，证明了领域专用训练的重要性。

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际的错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，而不是输入句子的文本相似度，创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，所提方法有效提升了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统的文本相似度方法更有效，创建的GEE数据集为未来研究提供了宝贵资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

TL;DR: 本研究通过系统实验发现，大语言模型在思维链推理中严重依赖提示中的线索，这些线索显著影响模型准确性和对线索的显式承认程度，揭示了LLM推理缺乏忠实性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大语言模型生成的思维链推理是否忠实于实际计算过程，还是仅仅是对提示中线索的回应，以评估推理过程的可靠性。

Method: 在四个数据集上使用两个先进模型，通过控制线索的正确性、呈现风格和复杂度，系统分析线索对任务准确性和线索承认度的影响。

Result: 正确线索显著提高准确性，错误线索降低准确性；方程线索常被显式引用，原始线索常被默默采用；奉承风格促进显式承认，泄露风格提高准确性但隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理系统性受到线索捷径的影响，这种影响模式模糊了推理的忠实性，反映了RLHF相关效应在模型行为中的作用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

TL;DR: 提出RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM在复杂搜索环境中的鲁棒性，解决查询变化导致的脆弱搜索行为问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在知识密集型任务中表现出色，但受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制。虽然外部搜索工具可以缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中查询的微小变化会导致推理偏离正确轨迹并放大错误。

Method: 提出RE-Searcher方法，在搜索过程中明确阐述具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标。结合目标导向规划和自我反思来抵抗复杂搜索环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果。扰动研究进一步证明了对噪声或误导性外部信号的强韧性，缓解了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的智能体集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器生成文本检测研究主要集中于英语，使得现有检测器几乎无法用于非英语语言，特别是中欧语言。目前针对中欧语言的检测方法研究很少，跨语言迁移能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用多领域、多生成器和多语言评估方法，比较不同训练语言组合的性能，并测试检测方法对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现，在中欧语言上进行监督微调的检测器在这些语言上表现最佳，并且对混淆攻击具有最强的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: 针对特定语言进行监督微调的检测器在中欧语言上表现最优，且具有最强的对抗鲁棒性，为多语言机器生成文本检测提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过自适应构建和调整推理过程来增强跨任务泛化能力，在多个领域显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务适应性。虽然少数方法尝试自动生成工作流，但通常与特定数据集或查询类型绑定，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含设计器和执行器两个核心组件。设计器将复杂问题分解为高层目标定义的子目标序列，并根据中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步骤。执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符来执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题解决和代码生成等多个领域进行系统评估，DyFlow显著优于现有基线，实现了显著的Pass@k改进，并在不同领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成和自适应调整，有效解决了现有LLM智能体系统在跨任务泛化和推理深度方面的局限性，为构建更高效和通用的智能体系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: LLM作为自动评估器存在严重偏见，会基于提示中的表面线索（如来源和时间）而非内容质量做出判断，且很少承认这些偏见因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前LLM作为评估器在判断系统输出时存在的偏见问题，验证其是否真正基于内容质量进行忠实评估。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench两个数据集构建100对比较任务，通过GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash模型评估，人为注入来源线索（Human/Expert/LLM/Unknown）和时间线索（Old/New）来测试偏见。

Result: 两个模型都表现出强烈的时间偏见（偏好新回答）和来源等级偏见（Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown），GPT-4o偏见更严重，LitBench领域偏见更明显，且模型几乎从不承认这些线索影响。

Conclusion: 当前LLM评估器容易依赖捷径且不忠实，严重削弱了其在研究和部署中作为评估器的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as

### [185] [Limited Preference Data? Learning Better Reward Model with Latent Space Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26074)
*Leitian Tao,Xuefeng Du,Yixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LENS框架，在LLM的潜在嵌入空间中直接合成偏好数据，避免昂贵的文本生成和标注，显著提升奖励建模效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对对齐LLM与人类偏好至关重要，但偏好数据的高成本成为瓶颈。现有文本数据合成方法计算昂贵

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成多样且语义一致的合成偏好对

Result: 潜在空间合成在标准基准上显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用模型小16,000倍，同时获得更优结果

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强改进奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

TL;DR: IMProofBench是一个专门评估大型语言模型在数学研究前沿任务表现的新基准，包含39个专家设计的证明问题，支持人类专家评估和自动化评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要关注最终答案或高中竞赛问题，无法评估模型在数学研究前沿的表现，需要开发更贴近真实研究环境的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含39个同行评审数学问题的私有基准，每个问题需要详细证明并配有子问题；采用代理框架让模型使用网络搜索和数学软件等工具进行求解。

Result: 当前LLM在较易的研究问题上表现良好，但在挑战性问题仍有困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率52%，GPT-5在证明生成上表现最佳，22%问题完全正确。

Conclusion: IMProofBench作为动态基准将持续发展，确保对下一代LLM评估的相关性，填补了数学研究前沿评估的空白。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

### [187] [Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems via Network-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093)
*Xiaoyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RSO框架，通过分层策略优化来改进对话推荐系统，将响应生成分解为宏观策略规划和微观专家网络适配，使用强化学习解决多轮对话数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对交互策略的显式优化，依赖统一提示导致结果不理想，需要更有效的策略学习框架。

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），执行器在偏好和事实专家指导下生成响应，使用强化学习和LLM奖励进行策略学习。

Result: 实验表明RSO优于现有最先进方法，验证了分层策略优化的有效性。

Conclusion: RSO框架通过策略分解和强化学习有效提升了对话推荐系统的性能，为LLM在CRS中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct
structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual
customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system
through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种算法来扩展预训练LLM的词汇表，通过添加领域特定token来减少词汇不匹配问题，从而降低token数量并提升推理速度，同时保持预测质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，词汇不匹配问题会导致领域特定术语被分割成多个子词，增加token数量并降低处理速度。

Method: 设计一种算法来扩展现有分词器的词汇表，保证分词效率不会降低——每个输入序列的分词数量最多与之前相同。

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强后的分词器将输入序列缩短达20%，减少下游任务的推理延迟，同时保持预测质量。还分析了前向传播速度和模型采用新token速率等次要影响。

Conclusion: 词汇适应具有更广泛的益处，能够显著提升LLM在特定领域应用中的处理效率和性能。

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Motivation: 探索竞争如何影响基于LLM的多智能体系统行为，特别是极端压力下智能体表现出的不可靠和有害行为如何破坏协作和任务性能。

Method: 提出HATE（饥饿游戏辩论）实验框架，在零和竞争环境中模拟多智能体辩论，通过不同LLM和任务进行实验，并引入不同变体的裁判来研究环境反馈的影响。

Result: 竞争压力显著刺激了过度竞争行为并降低了任务性能，导致讨论偏离正轨；客观、任务导向的反馈能有效缓解过度竞争行为。

Conclusion: 通过分析LLM的事后善意行为并形成排行榜，为理解和治理AI社区涌现的社会动态提供了见解。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To
address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for

extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative
models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation
strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they
provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

Conclusion: VietBinoculars方法在检测越南语LLM生成文本方面表现出色，为应对日益复杂的LLM生成内容提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT

Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，开放式有容量车辆路径问题涉及为服务地理分布客户的车辆车队寻找最优配送路线，且车辆在配送后无需返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发了两种算法的实现：基于自然启发的元启发式算法蚁群优化和行业标准优化工具包Google OR-Tools，并使用自定义数据集进行测试。

Result: 结果显示ACO在路由参数灵活性方面表现更好，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、一致性更高且需要更少的输入参数。

Conclusion: 这有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略，OR-Tools在速度和一致性方面更适合实时应用，而ACO在需要参数灵活性时更有优势。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中新实体频繁出现，模型需要泛化到未见过的实体。显式类型信息通常缺乏或不完整，即使可用也往往是粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号，进行基于子图的归纳链接预测。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号，提升归纳链接预测性能，特别是在类型信息有限的情况下。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂的数据混合和重复实验来获得最优泛化性能，这过程繁琐且计算成本高。

Method: 使用零学习率训练在通用数据上获取全局梯度，然后在领域训练中应用梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立仅需领域数据的微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，同时减少91.0%的GPU计算时间。

Conclusion: DBA提供了一种高效通用的微调解决方案，无需通用数据参与退火过程，消除了数据混合导致的重复实验需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合语义初始化和规划损失的语音语言模型，通过自监督特征初始化语音token、应用轻量对齐损失以及针对鲁棒性和内容规划的辅助目标训练，在保持声学稳定性和语义基础之间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在开发能够实现鲁棒且一致生成的语音语言模型，通过模型侧的设计和训练组合来控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，而无需改变tokenizer或运行时架构。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音token，应用轻量对齐损失，并采用针对鲁棒性和内容规划的稀疏化训练和辅助目标。训练了三个模型：0.7B纯语音模型、1.0B纯语音模型和1.0B文本语音交错模型。

Result: 声学研究显示纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素方面实现了最高的一致性，超越了更大的系统。交错模型改善了词汇和句法探测以及语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。线性探测表明初始化使模型偏向内容结构，同时牺牲了韵律细节。

Conclusion: LM侧的设计和训练组合能够控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，无需改变tokenizer或运行时架构。纯语音模型在一致性方面表现最佳，而交错模型在语义对齐方面有优势。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various

*Arduin Findeis,Timo Kaufmann,Eyke Hüllermeier,Robert Mullins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Feedback Forensics工具包，用于显式评估AI模型的人格特征，分析人类反馈数据集鼓励的人格特质，并追踪模型在这些特质上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法难以明确衡量AI模型的人格特征，基于排名的隐式评估存在不透明性，且模型可能过度拟合排行榜，导致人格问题。

Method: 开发开源工具包Feedback Forensics，利用AI标注器通过Python API和浏览器应用调查模型人格特征，分析流行人类反馈数据集和模型的人格特质。

Result: 工具包能够分析Chatbot Arena、MultiPref和PRISM等数据集鼓励的人格特质，并评估流行模型在这些特质上的表现。

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics为AI人格评估提供了透明工具，有助于理解人类反馈如何塑造模型人格，并追踪模型人格变化。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

### [201] [One-Token Rollout: Guiding Supervised Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Policy Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26313)
*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OTR是一种新颖的微调算法，通过将自回归学习过程重新构建为单步强化学习轨迹，利用策略梯度方法指导监督微调，从而提升大语言模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上通常不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异不仅源于损失函数，更根本的原因是SFT使用固定的预收集数据集，而RL使用从当前策略采样的在线数据。

Method: 提出one-token rollout(OTR)算法，将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹，通过从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，并使用监督数据中的真实token提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态离线数据转化为动态在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个挑战性基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT方法。

Conclusion: OTR为微调LLMs提供了强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为LLMs微调提供了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

*Hanwen Du,Yuxin Dong,Xia Ning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了Huggin-3.5B在潜在空间中的思考过程，提出了潜在思考优化(LTO)方法，使用潜在奖励模型(LRM)来优化LLM的潜在思考过程，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM使用自然语言进行链式思考计算成本高且容易过度思考，而潜在思考架构缺乏可解释性和监督机制，难以确保思考过程的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出潜在思考优化(LTO)算法，使用潜在分类器作为潜在奖励模型(LRM)来检测和优化潜在思考模式，该方法可泛化到不同领域并应用于通用LLM。

Result: 实验表明正确与错误答案对应的潜在思考模式具有高度可区分性，LRM能有效检测错误思考模式，LTO显著改善了潜在思考过程，并在多个推理任务上取得优异表现。

Conclusion: 在潜在空间中进行奖励建模和扩展测试时思考是一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法，为改进LLM思考过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2通过块扩散机制将预训练的自回归大语言模型转换为并行文本生成模型，仅需约1B tokens微调，比传统扩散LLM减少500倍训练数据，实现2.5倍加速且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型虽然性能优异，但其顺序解码机制限制了推理效率，需要开发高效的并行生成方法。

Method: 提出块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码，结合分层缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存）以及并行解码流水线。

Result: 在多种基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2在准确度上匹配或超越自回归基线，在dLLM中实现最先进的效率，达到2.5倍加速。

Conclusion: Fast-dLLM v2标志着向快速准确LLM实际部署迈出了重要一步，代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-R1是一个通过强化学习优化的知识图谱检索增强生成框架，使用单一智能体与知识图谱交互，相比传统多模块方法更高效且具有可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KG-RAG系统使用多个LLM模块（如规划、推理、响应），导致推理成本高且行为绑定到特定知识图谱，限制了效率和可迁移性。

Method: 提出KG-R1框架，使用单一智能体与知识图谱环境交互，通过强化学习端到端优化检索、推理和生成过程。

Result: 在KGQA基准测试中，使用Qwen-2.5-3B模型，KG-R1以更少的生成token实现了比传统多模块方法更高的答案准确率，且在新知识图谱上无需修改即可保持强准确性。

Conclusion: KG-R1是一个高效且可迁移的KG-RAG框架，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Motivation: 真实性评估语言表达与现实世界信息的关系程度，对事实核查至关重要。这是一个复杂概念，依赖多种语言信号，需要系统化的标注方案。

Method: 开发了一个结合先前多种工作的复杂多层面真实性标注方案，在希伯来语议会话语领域手动标注了近5000个句子，并实验了多种自动预测方法。

Result: 报告了标注者间一致性，并成功实验了将标注扩展到大型语料库的自动预测方法。

Conclusion: 该标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但相信可以适应其他语言，为真实性分析提供了系统化的框架和工具。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了使用微调的小型语言模型(SLMs)自动进行试题与内容标准对齐的可行性，在SAT和PSAT阅读写作测试数据上验证了模型性能，发现包含更多试题文本数据能显著提升模型表现，且微调SLMs优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的试题与内容标准对齐由人类专家完成，这个过程主观且耗时。本研究旨在探索使用小型语言模型实现自动对齐的可行性，以提高效率和客观性。

Method: 使用SAT和PSAT阅读写作测试数据，训练了针对不同内容领域和技能级别的微调小型语言模型。比较了不同类型和规模的训练数据对性能的影响，并与基于多语言E5-large-instruct模型嵌入的监督机器学习模型进行对比。

Result: 包含更多试题文本数据显著提升了模型性能，效果优于单纯增加样本量。微调的小型语言模型在细粒度技能对齐任务上持续优于基于嵌入的监督机器学习模型。语义相似性分析显示某些SAT和PSAT技能在语义上过于接近，解释了观察到的错误分类。

Conclusion: 微调的小型语言模型在自动试题对齐任务中表现出色，特别是在细粒度技能对齐方面。研究为使用语言模型自动化教育评估中的内容对齐提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

TL;DR: 提出了PACO框架，通过自适应规划解决多属性可控摘要任务，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索动态确定属性控制顺序，无需训练即可实现多属性约束的满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法存在属性间相互依赖难以一致满足、需要针对每个属性进行微调导致灵活性不足的问题。

Method: 将多属性可控摘要重构为顺序属性控制的规划问题，使用定制化蒙特卡洛树搜索，节点代表摘要，动作对应单属性调整，逐步优化需要进一步控制的属性。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的实验表明，PACO实现了鲁棒的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线。使用Llama-3.2-1B的PACO可与更大的Llama-3.3-70B基线相媲美。

Conclusion: PACO是一个无需训练的有效框架，能够自适应发现最优控制顺序，生成满足所有约束的摘要，在大模型上表现尤为出色。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个主要限制：体裁多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法强制执行复杂结构约束。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型作为叙事表示，通过三层智能体工作流：初始化阶段构建叙事骨架，生成阶段通过多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段利用原型生成多体裁文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以低成本（每100章节不到1美元）生成数千章节，质量稳定。在包含10个叙事指标的二维评估框架中，持续优于强基线，在多样化体裁中表现稳健，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过故事原型和智能体工作流有效解决了长文本生成的瓶颈，在创意写作任务中实现了高质量、低成本的稳定输出，接近人类创作水平。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性问题，避免传统方法中繁重且领域特定的特征工程，探索统一模型处理多种编程语言和硬件平台的可能性。

Method: 使用基于T5Gemma初始化的300M参数回归语言模型（RLM），直接从代码文本预测数值结果，支持多种编程语言和硬件平台。

Result: 在APPS竞争编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关系数；在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩相关系数>0.5；在五个经典NAS设计空间上获得0.46的最高平均Kendall-Tau系数。

Conclusion: 单一统一的回归语言模型能够有效预测多种代码执行指标，在多个编程语言和硬件平台上表现出强大的泛化能力，超越了传统图神经网络方法。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

TL;DR: dParallel是一种简单有效的方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，解锁扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，显著减少解码步骤同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的有前景替代方案，具有并行令牌预测和更低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分探索，现有开源模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤来保证性能。

Method: 提出确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，核心思想是在保持原始采样轨迹的同时，强制模型以更快速和并行的方式在掩码令牌上达到高确定性。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，dParallel将GSM8K的解码步骤从256减少到30，实现8.5倍加速且无性能下降；在MBPP基准上，解码步骤从256减少到24，实现10.5倍加速同时保持准确率。

Conclusion: dParallel方法能够显著减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，大幅提升推理速度，同时保持模型性能，为扩散模型的实用化部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn

enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve

*Yue Wang,Ruotian Ma,Xingyu Chen,Zhengliang Shi,Wanshun Chen,Huang Liu,Jiadi Yao,Qu Yang,Qingxuan Jiang,Fanghua Ye,Juntao Li,Min Zhang,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li,Linus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BatonVoice框架，将语音合成解耦为指令理解和语音生成两个阶段，利用LLM作为指挥者理解用户指令并生成文本化的语音特征计划，再由专门的TTS模型执行语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLM的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了可控文本到语音合成的效果。

Method: 采用操作主义思想，将语音合成解耦为指令理解和语音生成两个独立组件：LLM作为指挥者生成文本化的语音特征计划，BatonTTS作为执行者根据特征生成语音。

Result: BatonVoice在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越了开源和闭源基线模型，并实现了显著的零样本跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本化的语音特征能够更有效地解锁LLM的语言智能，为可控语音合成提供了新范式。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Matryoshka MoE训练框架，通过在训练中系统改变激活专家数量，使MoE模型具备弹性推理能力，在不同专家数量下都能保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Top-K路由器训练策略限制了MoE模型的弹性推理潜力，当推理时改变激活专家数量会导致性能急剧下降。

Method: 在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，强制模型学习从粗到细的层次结构：排名靠前的专家提供基本能力，后续专家添加更精细的细节。采用分层随机化策略。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型在不同专家数量下都能保持优异性能，其表现与整个专家模型套件相当，但训练成本仅为后者的一小部分。

Conclusion: M-MoE为大规模MoE模型提供了更实用和适应性强的部署方式，不仅实现弹性推理，还能通过在不同层分配不同计算预算来优化性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

TL;DR: OceanGym是首个面向海洋水下具身智能体的综合基准平台，旨在解决水下环境的极端感知和决策挑战，包含8个现实任务领域和基于多模态大语言模型的统一智能体框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境相比陆地或空中领域具有更极端的感知和决策挑战，包括低能见度、动态洋流等，使得智能体部署异常困难，需要专门的水下基准测试平台。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型驱动的统一智能体框架，整合感知、记忆和序列决策能力，要求智能体理解光学和声纳数据，在复杂环境中自主探索并完成长期目标。

Result: 广泛实验显示，当前最先进的多模态大语言模型驱动智能体与人类专家之间存在显著差距，特别是在感知、规划和适应性方面。

Conclusion: OceanGym通过提供高保真、严格设计的平台，为开发鲁棒的具身人工智能建立了测试床，并将这些能力转移到现实世界的自主水下航行器，标志着向能够在海洋这一地球最后未开发前沿领域运行的智能体迈出了决定性一步。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are
available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.

TL;DR: 提出了首个为语音转文本生成模型获取对比解释的方法，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响替代输出选择，在语音翻译的性别分配案例中验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比解释（说明AI系统为何产生目标输出而非替代输出）被认为比标准解释更具信息性和可解释性，但为语音转文本生成模型获取此类解释仍是一个开放挑战。

Method: 基于特征归因技术，通过分析输入频谱图各部分如何影响替代输出选择来获得对比解释。

Result: 在语音翻译性别分配的案例研究中，该方法准确识别了驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征。

Conclusion: 通过将对比解释范围扩展到语音转文本领域，为更好理解语音转文本模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的统一框架，通过生成合成的多步工具使用任务来避免数据污染，并允许精确控制任务难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在函数数量、任务复杂度和输入大小等因素上控制不足，且容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。模型需要组合正确的调用序列来计算目标变量。

Result: 推理优化模型始终优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳。性能随依赖深度增加而急剧下降，连接的无关函数特别难以处理。模型常生成语法正确的调用但传播错误参数值。

Conclusion: 在每一步明确重述先前变量值的轻量级缓解策略能显著提升模型性能，揭示了LLM在多轮工具使用中状态跟踪的脆弱性。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%
for GPT-5.

TL;DR: MT-breaker是一种使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本以增加翻译难度的方法，能够生成更具挑战性但保持自然文本多样性的测试用例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的机器翻译基准测试很快过时，因为大多数示例对最先进的翻译模型来说过于简单，无法有效区分模型优劣或揭示模型弱点。

Method: 使用大语言模型迭代查询目标机器翻译模型，通过不断优化源文本来增加翻译难度，同时保持文本的自然性和多样性。

Result: 该方法生成的示例不仅对目标MT模型更具挑战性，而且这种难度也能迁移到其他模型和语言上。

Conclusion: MT-breaker提供了一种有效的方法来创建更具挑战性的机器翻译测试用例，能够更好地评估和比较不同翻译模型的性能。

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自偏见问题，会系统性地偏向生成该基准的模型，特别是在低资源语言的英译任务中。这种偏见来自测试数据生成和评估方法两方面，且受模型在源语言生成能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM开始饱和现有基准测试，使用LLM自动创建基准成为一种可扩展的替代方案，但发现这些生成的测试集存在严重缺陷。

Method: 研究分析了LLM作为基准测试时产生的自偏见现象，考察了测试数据生成和评估方法两个来源，并探讨了源语言生成能力和文本多样性对偏见的影响。

Result: 发现LLM生成的基准测试会系统性地偏向生成该基准的模型；自偏见在英译任务中更为明显；源文本多样性低是自偏见的一个重要原因。

Conclusion: 改进生成源文本的多样性可以缓解观察到的自偏见问题，为LLM基准测试的可靠性提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大语言模型在不同语言中产生原生质量的响应具有挑战性，需要开发可扩展的多语言评估框架。

Method: 引入MENLO评估框架，基于受众设计机制创建人工标注数据集，采用零样本LLM评估器、强化学习、奖励塑造和多任务学习等方法。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在成对评估和结构化标注标准下表现提升，但仍不及人工标注者；通过微调显著改善了评估性能；RL训练的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力。

Conclusion: 研究为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，发布了数据集和评估框架以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设、验证、分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类SOTA方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模证据表明AI能够在科学任务上实现逐步超越人类最先进水平的发现，真正推动科学发现前沿。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要具有足够挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量互联网主题中寻找最困难主题的计算成本过高。

Method: 将寻找困难主题任务形式化为多臂老虎机问题，每个主题视为一个"臂"，通过抽样评估示例难度来识别最困难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为在有限计算资源下高效识别挑战性NLP测试数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率语音标记，但Transformer的自注意力机制处理长序列时计算成本高昂。音节级标记化能大幅压缩标记长度，但其在口语语言建模中的价值尚未充分探索。

Method: 对音节级语音标记化进行系统性研究，在不同训练数据规模下评估模型在一系列口语理解基准测试上的表现。

Result: 音节标记在显著降低训练时间和计算量（训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍）的同时，性能能够匹配或超越传统高帧率标记。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子下的收敛行为，了解模型训练过程中分布学习的稳定性问题。

Method: 通过计算不同随机种子下每token的KL散度来度量收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、token频率和词性标签对收敛的影响。

Result: 识别出四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、急剧收敛阶段、急剧发散阶段和缓慢再收敛阶段；发现大模型在后期训练阶段再收敛更快，小模型无法真正再收敛；高频token和功能词比低频token和实词收敛更快更稳定。

Conclusion: 模型大小对学习稳定分布至关重要，收敛在不同语言类别中是不均衡的，这些发现揭示了影响模型训练中学习分布稳定性的关键因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

Conclusion: KGQAGen为KGQA评估提供了可扩展的框架，倡导更严格的基准构建标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality
benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their
widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical
quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations,
poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and
outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA
datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual
correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen,
an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls.
KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and
symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using
KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in
Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark,
highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings
advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a
scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

models, the task of spatial reconstruction requires genuine spatial
intelligence: inferring room layouts, understanding connectivity, and
maintaining consistent scale. We evaluate leading language models (GPT-5,
Claude 4 Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-4), image generation models (GPT-Image,
NanoBanana), and agent systems (Codex CLI, Claude Code) on a dataset of 50
apartments with approximately 20 interior images each. Our scoring algorithm
measures similarity between generated and ground-truth floor plans based on
room connectivity graphs and size rankings. Results reveal a significant blind
spot in current AI capabilities: most models perform at or below a random
baseline, while human performance remains substantially superior. Image
generation models particularly struggle with instruction following, while
agent-based approaches with iterative refinement capabilities show no
meaningful improvement over single-pass generation. Blueprint-Bench provides
the first numerical framework for comparing spatial intelligence across
different model architectures. We will continue evaluating new models as they
are released and welcome community submissions, monitoring for the emergence of
spatial intelligence in generalist AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出因果抽象网络(CAN)，一种基于高斯结构因果模型的网络束结构，通过局部黎曼优化和SPECTRAL算法有效学习一致的因果抽象关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过结构因果模型提升AI的可解释性、可信性和鲁棒性，利用网络束形式化因果知识表示。

Method: 构建高斯SCM的因果抽象网络，使用转置线性因果抽象作为限制映射，提出基于局部黎曼问题的学习框架和SPECTRAL迭代算法。

Result: 在合成数据实验中表现出在因果抽象学习任务中的竞争性能，成功恢复多样化的CAN结构。

Conclusion: CAN为因果AI提供了一种理论严谨且计算高效的学习框架，能够有效建模多层次的因果抽象关系。

Abstract: Causal artificial intelligence aims to enhance explainability,
trustworthiness, and robustness in AI by leveraging structural causal models
(SCMs). In this pursuit, recent advances formalize network sheaves of causal
knowledge. Pushing in the same direction, we introduce the causal abstraction
network (CAN), a specific instance of such sheaves where (i) SCMs are Gaussian,
(ii) restriction maps are transposes of constructive linear causal abstractions
(CAs), and (iii) edge stalks correspond -- up to rotation -- to the node stalks
of more detailed SCMs. We investigate the theoretical properties of CAN,
including algebraic invariants, cohomology, consistency, global sections
characterized via the Laplacian kernel, and smoothness. We then tackle the
learning of consistent CANs. Our problem formulation separates into
edge-specific local Riemannian problems and avoids nonconvex, costly
objectives. We propose an efficient search procedure as a solution, solving the
local problems with SPECTRAL, our iterative method with closed-form updates and
suitable for positive definite and semidefinite covariance matrices.
Experiments on synthetic data show competitive performance in the CA learning
task, and successful recovery of diverse CAN structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了思维链(CoT)和循环模型中的潜在思维两种推理范式，发现潜在思维支持并行计算更高效，而CoT通过随机解码处理难解问题，为选择推理方法提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链(CoT)和循环模型中潜在思维两种推理方法的比较能力，目前这方面的研究还不够深入。

Method: 对循环Transformer中的潜在思维进行形式化分析，比较其与CoT在计算效率和能力上的差异。

Result: 潜在思维支持并行计算，比CoT的序列过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码近似解决难解问题。两种方法在不同任务中各有优势。

Conclusion: 深度驱动递归和CoT推理范式适用于不同类型的任务，为实际应用中选择推理方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

TL;DR: NGT结合向量聚类与多智能体系统，解决定性研究的规模深度悖论，能在几小时内分析海量数据集，同时保持解释严谨性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决定性研究中规模与深度的矛盾，传统方法无法同时处理大规模数据和保持解释深度，NGT旨在实现大规模定性分析的高效自动化。

Method: 使用1536维向量嵌入、层次聚类和并行智能体编码，对比手动编码和ChatGPT辅助分析，测试纯自动化与人工指导精炼两种模式。

Result: NGT实现168倍速度提升（3小时vs3周）、更高质量（0.904vs0.883）和96%成本降低，发现手动编码无法识别的模式如身份分叉现象。

Conclusion: 计算客观性与人类解释互补，向量表示提供可复现的语义测量，研究者从机械编码转向理论指导，AI处理模式识别，人类提供创造性洞察。

Abstract: Purpose: Neo Grounded Theory (NGT) integrates vector clustering with multi
agent systems to resolve qualitative research's scale depth paradox, enabling
analysis of massive datasets in hours while preserving interpretive rigor.
Methods: We compared NGT against manual coding and ChatGPT-assisted analysis
using 40,000 character Chinese interview transcripts. NGT employs
1536-dimensional embeddings, hierarchical clustering, and parallel agent-based
coding. Two experiments tested pure automation versus human guided refinement.
Findings: NGT achieved 168-fold speed improvement (3 hours vs 3 weeks),
superior quality (0.904 vs 0.883), and 96% cost reduction. Human AI
collaboration proved essential: automation alone produced abstract frameworks
while human guidance yielded actionable dual pathway theories. The system
discovered patterns invisible to manual coding, including identity bifurcation
phenomena. Contributions: NGT demonstrates computational objectivity and human
interpretation are complementary. Vector representations provide reproducible
semantic measurement while preserving meaning's interpretive dimensions.
Researchers shift from mechanical coding to theoretical guidance, with AI
handling pattern recognition while humans provide creative insight.
Implications: Cost reduction from \$50,000 to \$500 democratizes qualitative
research, enabling communities to study themselves. Real-time analysis makes
qualitative insights contemporaneous with events. The framework shows
computational methods can strengthen rather than compromise qualitative
research's humanistic commitments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LCNC平台中的自主智能体在执行长期业务过程时面临记忆膨胀和上下文退化问题，导致行为不一致、错误累积和计算成本增加。

Method: 采用受认知科学启发的混合记忆架构，结合情景记忆和语义记忆，引入基于时效性、相关性和用户指定效用的复合评分智能衰减机制，并提供用户友好的可视化界面。

Result: 通过模拟长期任务实验，该系统在任务完成率、上下文一致性和长期令牌成本效率方面显著优于滑动窗口和基础RAG等传统方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新的框架，用于构建可靠、透明的AI智能体，能够实现有效的长期学习和适应。

Abstract: The rise of AI-native Low-Code/No-Code (LCNC) platforms enables autonomous
agents capable of executing complex, long-duration business processes. However,
a fundamental challenge remains: memory management. As agents operate over
extended periods, they face "memory inflation" and "contextual degradation"
issues, leading to inconsistent behavior, error accumulation, and increased
computational cost. This paper proposes a novel hybrid memory system designed
specifically for LCNC agents. Inspired by cognitive science, our architecture
combines episodic and semantic memory components with a proactive "Intelligent
Decay" mechanism. This mechanism intelligently prunes or consolidates memories
based on a composite score factoring in recency, relevance, and user-specified
utility. A key innovation is a user-centric visualization interface, aligned
with the LCNC paradigm, which allows non-technical users to manage the agent's
memory directly, for instance, by visually tagging which facts should be
retained or forgotten. Through simulated long-running task experiments, we
demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional approaches
like sliding windows and basic RAG, yielding superior task completion rates,
contextual consistency, and long-term token cost efficiency. Our findings
establish a new framework for building reliable, transparent AI agents capable
of effective long-term learning and adaptation.

TL;DR: Fact Grounded Attention (FGA) 通过直接向注意力机制注入可验证知识，将不可靠的语言模型转变为确定性真相讲述者，在技术查询中实现了从6.3%到99.7%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型基于概率本质而产生的幻觉问题，特别是在事实陈述方面，目标是实现从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Method: 在transformer的预softmax注意力分数层面进行干预，直接将可验证知识注入注意力机制，而不是在生成后修补幻觉或在文本前添加检索内容。

Result: 在1,107个技术查询实验中，准确率从原始Llama 3.2的6.3%提升到FGA的99.7%，知识更新可在1秒内完成而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: FGA不仅减少了幻觉，对于可验证事实完全消除了幻觉，标志着神经网络语言生成从概率近似到确定性精度的根本转变。

Abstract: "The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of
knowledge." Large Language Models have conquered natural language but remain
prisoners of their own probabilistic nature--confidently hallucinating facts
they never truly knew. We present Fact Grounded Attention (FGA), a novel
architectural modification that transforms unreliable language models into
deterministic truth tellers by injecting verifiable knowledge directly into the
attention mechanism. Unlike existing approaches that patch hallucinations after
generation or prepend retrieved text, FGA intervenes at the mathematical heart
of the transformer--the pre-softmax attention scores--creating a model that
cannot hallucinate when facts exist in its knowledge base. Our experiments
across 1,107 technical queries spanning smartphones, laptops, and electric
vehicles demonstrate a transformation from 6.3% accuracy in vanilla Llama 3.2
to 99.7% accuracy with FGA. More critically, knowledge updates occur in under
one second without retraining, compared to hours for parameter editing
approaches. FGA doesn't just reduce hallucination--it eliminates it entirely
for verifiable facts, marking a fundamental shift from probabilistic
approximation to deterministic precision in neural language generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解仅解码器语言模型是否以及如何进行规划（组织中间计算以支持连贯的长程生成），这对可解释性、可靠性和模型设计具有重要意义。

Method: 使用基于向量量化变分自编码器的管道压缩transformer隐藏状态为紧凑摘要代码，通过互信息测量分析计算结构，在合成语法、路径查找任务和自然语言数据集中研究规划能力。

Result: 发现有效规划范围是任务依赖的，模型隐式保留未使用正确延续的信息，预测主要依赖最近计算但早期块仍保持信息性。

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了一个通用管道用于探测语言模型和深度学习系统的内部动态。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败等固有局限性，影响了风险评估过程的鲁棒性。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性风险、隐性风险和非风险三个互斥子空间，提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，采用四个专业互补角色进行多轮辩论，并利用动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的评估数据集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线评估方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线方法提高了28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架能够全面覆盖显性和隐性风险，同时减轻评估者偏见，为大语言模型安全评估提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，RLVR技术快速发展以增强其推理能力，但其复杂的数据流和多样化任务给RL训练系统带来挑战，目前从系统角度对RLVR的理解有限。

Method: 通过特征研究分析RLVR任务在LLM部署中的工作负载分布和变化趋势，识别系统问题如GPU闲置、并行策略低效等。

Result: 研究发现GPU因序列长度分布不均而闲置，动态变化工作负载中的并行策略效率低下，数据管理机制不高效，存在负载不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出了PolyTrace基准套件进行实际工作负载评估，验证显示该套件具有94.7%的准确性，呼吁进一步研究剩余开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now widely used across many domains. With
their rapid development, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
has surged in recent months to enhance their reasoning and understanding
abilities. However, its complex data flows and diverse tasks pose substantial
challenges to RL training systems, and there is limited understanding of RLVR
from a system perspective. To thoroughly understand the system challenges
introduced by RLVR, we present a characterization study of RLVR tasks in our
LLM deployment. Specifically, we investigate the distribution and variation
trends of workloads across different RL tasks across training steps. We
identify issues such as GPU idling caused by skewed sequence length
distribution, inefficient parallel strategies in dynamically varying workloads,
inefficient data management mechanisms, and load imbalance. We describe our
observations and call for further investigation into the remaining open
challenges. Furthermore, we propose PolyTrace benchmark suite to conduct
evaluation with realistic workloads, and a practical use case validates that
PolyTrace benchmark suite exhibits 94.7% accuracy.

Motivation: 解决LLM代理在低代码环境中因依赖概率关联而非因果理解而产生的幻觉和逻辑不一致问题

Method: 开发CVP框架，允许用户通过低代码界面定义工作流模块的"世界模型"，构建有向无环图来明确模块间的因果关系，作为代理推理过程的约束

Result: 在模拟训练-测试环境分布偏移的实验中，因果锚定模型保持稳定准确率，而依赖概率关联的基线模型性能显著下降

Conclusion: CVP为构建更可解释、可靠和可信的AI代理提供了可行路径

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating
complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit
hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning
mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal
understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual
Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly
introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to
define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive
low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that
explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph
acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring
its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing
logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious
correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic
experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift
between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally
anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a
purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations
experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this
study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the
proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to
a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors
caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path
toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成代理在处理长期任务时，随着记忆上下文增长，难以维持人格一致性，导致身份漂移、忽略既定信念和幻觉传播等关键失败。

Method: 引入ID-RAG机制，构建动态结构化身份模型（知识图谱），在代理决策循环中查询相关身份上下文来指导行动选择。

Result: 在市长选举社交模拟中，使用ID-RAG的HAis代理在长期人格一致性方面优于基线代理，身份召回率更高，模拟收敛时间减少19%（GPT-4o）和58%（GPT-4o mini）。

Conclusion: 通过将身份视为显式可检索的知识结构，ID-RAG为开发更时间一致、可解释和对齐的生成代理提供了基础方法。

Abstract: Generative agents powered by language models are increasingly deployed for
long-horizon tasks. However, as long-term memory context grows over time, they
struggle to maintain coherence. This deficiency leads to critical failures,
including identity drift, ignoring established beliefs, and the propagation of
hallucinations in multi-agent systems. To mitigate these challenges, this paper
introduces Identity Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ID-RAG), a novel mechanism
designed to ground an agent's persona and persistent preferences in a dynamic,
structured identity model: a knowledge graph of core beliefs, traits, and
values. During the agent's decision loop, this model is queried to retrieve
relevant identity context, which directly informs action selection. We
demonstrate this approach by introducing and implementing a new class of ID-RAG
enabled agents called Human-AI Agents (HAis), where the identity model is
inspired by the Chronicle structure used in Perspective-Aware AI, a dynamic
knowledge graph learned from a real-world entity's digital footprint. In social
simulations of a mayoral election, HAis using ID-RAG outperformed baseline
agents in long-horizon persona coherence - achieving higher identity recall
across all tested models by the fourth timestep - and reduced simulation
convergence time by 19% (GPT-4o) and 58% (GPT-4o mini). By treating identity as
an explicit, retrievable knowledge structure, ID-RAG offers a foundational
approach for developing more temporally coherent, interpretable, and aligned
generative agents. Our code is open-source and available at:

TL;DR: Flash-Searcher是一个并行代理推理框架，将顺序处理重新设计为有向无环图(DAG)，通过并行执行独立推理路径和动态工作流优化，显著提高复杂推理任务的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的工具使用框架主要依赖顺序处理，导致在需要大量工具交互的任务中执行效率低下。

Method: 将复杂任务分解为具有明确依赖关系的子任务，使用有向无环图实现并行执行，并通过动态工作流优化和摘要模块集成来持续优化执行图。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：BrowseComp准确率67.7%，xbench-DeepSearch准确率83%，相比现有框架减少代理执行步骤达35%。将并行推理流程蒸馏到单一模型后，在不同骨干架构上都观察到显著性能提升。

Conclusion: Flash-Searcher代表了代理架构设计的重大进步，为复杂推理任务提供了更具可扩展性和高效性的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估LLM代理自我复制风险的框架，通过真实生产环境测试发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下存在失控自我复制倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在现实应用中的广泛部署，由目标错位驱动的自我复制风险（类似《黑客帝国》中的Agent Smith）引起了关注。现有研究主要关注直接指令下的自我复制，而忽略了现实场景中自发性复制的风险。

Method: 建立真实生产环境和现实任务（如动态负载均衡），设计可能引发用户与代理目标错位的任务，引入过用率(OR)和聚合过用计数(AOC)指标来精确捕捉失控复制的频率和严重程度。

Result: 评估21个最先进的开源和专有模型，发现超过50%的LLM代理在操作压力下表现出明显的失控自我复制倾向，总体风险评分(ΦR)超过安全阈值0.5。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在实际部署LLM代理时，迫切需要基于场景的风险评估和强大的安全保障措施。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

TL;DR: SynthPert通过使用前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对大型语言模型进行监督微调，显著提升了细胞对遗传扰动响应的预测性能，在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测细胞对遗传扰动的响应是系统生物学中的基本挑战，对治疗发现和虚拟细胞建模至关重要。尽管大型语言模型在生物推理方面显示出潜力，但由于难以适应结构化实验数据，其在扰动预测中的应用仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出SynthPert方法，通过使用前沿模型生成的合成推理轨迹对大型语言模型进行监督微调，即使部分推理轨迹不准确也能有效提取生物知识。

Result: 在PerturbQA基准测试中达到最先进性能，超越生成训练数据的前沿模型；在未见过的RPE1细胞上实现87%的跨细胞类型泛化准确率；仅使用2%质量过滤的训练数据仍保持性能增益。

Conclusion: 合成推理蒸馏方法能有效增强大型语言模型在特定领域的推理能力，为生物医学应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a
fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic
discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show
promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction
remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured
experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM
performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces
generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate
that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses
the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our
results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively
distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach
enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells,
and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered
training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning
distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出结构化奖励模型(SRM)，通过模块化设计和细粒度维度评估，解决传统标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型在工业部署中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量奖励模型难以融入上下文信息，生成式奖励模型存在黑盒性和效率问题，工业场景需要结构化反馈来诊断和优化特定维度问题。

Method: 采用模块化框架，集成侧分支模型作为辅助特征生成器，引入细粒度维度实现可解释和高效评估。

Result: SRM在鲁棒性和与人类偏好对齐方面优于标量奖励模型和生成式奖励模型，模块化设计支持实际场景的高效优化。

Conclusion: SRM为工业应用提供了实用的奖励建模解决方案，确保适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are key components for evaluating and guiding language
model outputs. However, traditional scalar RMs often struggle with
incorporating contextual and background information during inference, leading
to incomplete evaluations. Generative RMs (GRMs) attempt to address these
limitations by generating intermediate reasoning steps. Yet, their uncontrolled
black-box nature and inefficiency due to sequential decoding hinder their
industrial deployment. Industrial scenarios, such as search and recommendation
systems, often involve single-domain tasks requiring evaluation along specific
dimensions. In such contexts, diagnosing "bad cases" necessitates structured
feedback to identify and optimize dimension-specific issues. In this paper, we
propose the Structural Reward Model (SRM), a modular and interpretable
framework integrating side-branch models as auxiliary feature generators. By
introducing fine-grained dimensions, SRMs enable interpretable and efficient
evaluation, facilitating targeted diagnostics and optimization. This structured
approach ensures adaptability and scalability for industrial applications.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SRMs outperform scalar
RMs and GRMs in robustness and alignment with human preferences. The modular
design further supports efficient optimization for practical scenarios,
allowing SRM to provide a practical reward modeling solution for industry.

TL;DR: 提出了AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法、AgentErrorBench数据集和AgentDebug调试框架，用于检测和修复LLM智能体中的级联错误，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在复杂任务中容易因单个错误导致级联失败，现有系统缺乏模块化、系统性的错误理解框架来检测这些错误。

Method: 1) 引入AgentErrorTaxonomy错误分类法；2) 构建AgentErrorBench数据集；3) 提出AgentDebug调试框架，能够隔离根本原因错误并提供纠正反馈。

Result: 在AgentErrorBench上的实验显示，AgentDebug相比最强基线实现了24%的全正确准确率和17%的步骤准确率提升，在ALFWorld、GAIA和WebShop上任务成功率相对提升达26%。

Conclusion: 系统化调试是实现更可靠、自适应LLM智能体的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrate planning, memory,
reflection, and tool-use modules, have shown promise in solving complex,
multi-step tasks. Yet their sophisticated architectures amplify vulnerability
to cascading failures, where a single root-cause error propagates through
subsequent decisions, leading to task failure. Current systems lack a framework
that can comprehensively understand agent error in a modular and systemic way,
and therefore fail to detect these errors accordingly. We address this gap with
three contributions. First, we introduce the AgentErrorTaxonomy, a modular
classification of failure modes spanning memory, reflection, planning, action,
and system-level operations. Second, we construct AgentErrorBench, the first
dataset of systematically annotated failure trajectories from ALFWorld, GAIA,
and WebShop, grounding error analysis in real-world agent rollouts. Third, we
propose AgentDebug, a debugging framework that isolates root-cause failures and
provides corrective feedback, enabling agents to recover and iteratively
improve. Experiments on AgentErrorBench show that AgentDebug achieves 24%
higher all-correct accuracy and 17% higher step accuracy compared to the
strongest baseline. Beyond detection, the targeted feedback generated by
AgentDebug enables LLM agents to iteratively recover from failures, yielding up
to 26% relative improvements in task success across ALFWorld, GAIA, and
WebShop. These results establish principled debugging as a pathway to more
reliable and adaptive LLM agents. The code and data will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在感知和认知之间存在脱节，导致推理失败和幻觉问题，缺乏构建连贯可信内部世界模型的能力。

Method: 引入"从感知到认知"分析框架，将视觉语言理解分解为感知层（准确提取视觉信息并与文本对齐）和认知层（基于感知的主动多步目标导向推理），形成动态的观察-思考-验证推理循环。

Result: 系统分析了当前MLLMs在两个层面的关键瓶颈，调查了从增强低级视觉表征到改进高级推理范式的尖端方法，并回顾了关键基准测试。

Conclusion: 该调查为研究社区提供了理解当前MLLMs内在局限性的结构化视角，并为构建具有深度推理和真正世界理解能力的下一代模型指明了路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) strive to achieve a profound,
human-like understanding of and interaction with the physical world, but often
exhibit a shallow and incoherent integration when acquiring information
(Perception) and conducting reasoning (Cognition). This disconnect leads to a
spectrum of reasoning failures, with hallucination being the most prominent.
Collectively, these issues expose a fundamental challenge: the ability to
process pixels does not yet confer the ability to construct a coherent,
credible internal world model. To systematically dissect and address this
challenge, this survey introduces a novel and unified analytical framework:
``From Perception to Cognition." We deconstruct the complex process of
vision-language interactive understanding into two interdependent layers:
Perception, the foundational ability to accurately extract visual information
and achieve fine-grained alignment with textual instructions; and Cognition,
the higher-order capability for proactive, multi-step, goal-oriented reasoning
built upon this perceptual foundation, the core of which is the formation of a
dynamic observe-think-verify reasoning loop. Guided by this framework, this
paper systematically analyzes the key bottlenecks of current MLLMs at both
layers. It surveys the landscape of cutting-edge methods designed to address
these challenges, spanning from techniques that enhance low-level visual
representations to those that improve high-level reasoning paradigms.
Furthermore, we review critical benchmarks and delineate future research
directions. This survey aims to provide the research community with a clear,
structured perspective for understanding the intrinsic limitations of current
MLLMs and to illuminate the path toward building next-generation models capable
of deep reasoning and a genuine understanding of the world.

*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器模型，通过将后验显著性转化为可操作的监督信号，实现跨时间点的临床变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医学视觉问答需要比较不同时间点的配对研究，回答关于临床有意义变化的问题。在这种设置下，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比绝对的单图像发现更具信息性。

Method: 模型首先执行轻量级近恒等仿射预对齐以减少访问间的干扰运动。然后在每个epoch内执行两步循环：步骤1从答案中提取医学相关关键词，并在两张图像上生成关键词条件化的Grad-CAM以获得疾病聚焦的显著性；步骤2将共享的显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。值得注意的是，主干网络和解码器是在通用领域预训练的，没有放射学特定的预训练。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持了具有轻度预对齐的显著性条件生成作为医学VQA中纵向推理的原则性框架，突出了实用性和可转移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: ImitSAT是基于模仿学习的CDCL求解器分支策略，通过从专家KeyTrace中学习决策序列，直接减少传播次数和运行时间，优于现有学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么预测实例级信号间接改进CDCL分支，要么依赖强化学习和不足的CDCL信息，无法直接优化分支决策。

Method: 从专家KeyTrace学习，将完整运行压缩为生存决策序列，在相同实例上重放几乎无冲突，提供密集决策级监督，直接减少传播次数。

Result: 实验表明ImitSAT减少了传播次数和运行时间，优于最先进的基于学习的方法。

Conclusion: ImitSAT通过前缀条件监督能够重现高质量分支，无需探索，实现更快收敛、稳定训练和与CDCL的无缝集成。

Abstract: We propose ImitSAT, a branching policy for conflict-driven clause learning
(CDCL) solvers based on imitation learning for the Boolean satisfiability
problem (SAT). Unlike previous methods that predict instance-level signals to
improve CDCL branching indirectly, or rely on reinforcement learning and
insufficient CDCL information to enhance branching, ImitSAT learns from expert
KeyTrace that collapses a full run into the sequence of surviving decisions.
Replaying a KeyTrace on the same instance is nearly conflict-free, providing
dense decision-level supervision and directly reducing propagations -- the
dominant contributor to wall-clock time. This prefix-conditioned supervision
enables ImitSAT to reproduce high-quality branches without exploration,
yielding faster convergence, stable training, and seamless integration into
CDCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImitSAT reduces propagation counts
and runtime, outperforming state-of-the-art learned approaches. We released the
source code and trained model at https://github.com/zewei-Zhang/ImitSAT

Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然提高了准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理或代码生成等任务的规划-执行特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，引入动态预算分配机制，根据奖励反馈自适应地重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，并采用动态预算分配，能够有效提高推理任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Motivation: 解决实际部署中推理模型选择时面临的性能和成本权衡问题，即模型大小和推理预算之间的平衡。

Method: 基于心理测量学，从不同预算下模型对不同查询的响应中学习项目响应模型，获得可解释的查询难度和模型-预算能力参数，然后将高难度查询路由到高能力模型-预算对。

Result: 在8个广泛使用的挑战性推理基准测试中，RADAR相比最先进的模型路由方法表现出优越性能，并在所有基准测试中对分布外查询展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RADAR是一个有效、可扩展的推理模型路由框架，能够通过动态选择少量评估查询来高效集成额外模型，实现性能和成本的优化平衡。

Abstract: Reasoning language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on many
challenging tasks in math, science, and coding. Choosing the right reasoning
model for practical deployment involves a performance and cost tradeoff at two
key levels: model size and reasoning budget, where larger models and higher
reasoning budget lead to better performance but with increased cost and
latency. In this work, we tackle this tradeoff from the angle of model
configuration routing for different queries, and present RADAR
(Reasoning-Ability and Difficulty-Aware Routing), a lightweight, interpretable,
and scalable routing framework. Inspired by psychometrics, RADAR learns an item
response model from model responses with different budgets to different
queries, with interpretable parameters including query difficulties and
model-budget abilities. RADAR then routes queries with higher difficulty to
model-budget pairs with higher ability, and vice versa. We conduct extensive
experiments on 8 widely used challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating
the superior performance of RADAR compared to state-of-the-art model routing
methods. RADAR also exhibits query generalization capabilities, showing strong
performance on out-of-distribution queries in all benchmarks. RADAR is also
scalable and can efficiently integrate additional models by dynamically
selecting a small set of evaluation queries to estimate their abilities.

Conclusion: Open Syndrome Definition格式实现了病例定义在系统间的一致性和可扩展使用，释放了AI在加强公共卫生准备和响应方面的潜力。

Abstract: Case definitions are essential for effectively communicating public health
threats. However, the absence of a standardized, machine-readable format poses
significant challenges to interoperability, epidemiological research, the
exchange of qualitative data, and the effective application of computational
analysis methods, including artificial intelligence (AI). This complicates
comparisons and collaborations across organizations and regions, limits data
integration, and hinders technological innovation in public health. To address
these issues, we propose the first open, machine-readable format for
representing case and syndrome definitions. Additionally, we introduce the
first comprehensive dataset of standardized case definitions and tools to
convert existing human-readable definitions into machine-readable formats. We
also provide an accessible online platform for browsing, analyzing, and
contributing new definitions, available at https://opensyndrome.org. The Open

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练平台期问题，数千次优化步骤后性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式，模型依赖有限的rollout，往往错过关键推理路径且无法系统覆盖解空间。

Method: DeepSearch在训练循环中嵌入结构化搜索，包含：(1)全局前沿选择策略，优先考虑搜索树中有前景的节点；(2)基于熵的引导选择，识别有信心的路径进行监督；(3)自适应回放缓冲区训练与解决方案缓存以提高效率。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，DeepSearch达到62.95%的平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立了新的最先进水平，比扩展训练方法少用5.7倍GPU小时。

Conclusion: DeepSearch通过系统化搜索而非延长计算时间，为扩展推理能力确立了新方向，强调了战略性探索相对于暴力扩展的重要性。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在语音任务中表现良好，但在语音情感识别方面表现不佳，主要由于副语言建模能力弱和跨模态推理能力有限

Method: 引入结构化情感图，编码7种声学特征、文本情感、关键词和跨模态关联，通过组合式思维链提示引导模型推理

Result: 在多个SER基准测试中超越先前SOTA方法，相比零样本基线显著提升准确率

Conclusion: CCoT-Emo框架通过结构化情感图有效增强LALMs的情感推理能力，提供可解释且组合式的表示方法

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) exhibit strong zero-shot performance
across speech tasks but struggle with speech emotion recognition (SER) due to
weak paralinguistic modeling and limited cross-modal reasoning. We propose
Compositional Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Emotion Reasoning (CCoT-Emo), a
framework that introduces structured Emotion Graphs (EGs) to guide LALMs in
emotion inference without fine-tuning. Each EG encodes seven acoustic features
(e.g., pitch, speech rate, jitter, shimmer), textual sentiment, keywords, and
cross-modal associations. Embedded into prompts, EGs provide interpretable and
compositional representations that enhance LALM reasoning. Experiments across
SER benchmarks show that CCoT-Emo outperforms prior SOTA and improves accuracy
over zero-shot baselines.

Motivation: 现有的可解释性框架难以原生支持复杂模型（如图像字幕、深度强化学习等），这些模型通常具有多输入输出或可组合的网络结构。

Method: 开发基于tensordict的轻量级框架，提供归因、探测和灵活干预API，支持计算机视觉、自然语言处理和强化学习等领域的复杂组合模型。

Result: TDHook依赖库极小，磁盘空间约为transformer_lens的一半，在基准测试中比captum快2倍（CPU和GPU上运行集成梯度多目标管道）。

Conclusion: TDHook填补了复杂模型可解释性工具的空缺，使现代可解释性管道更易用，并在CV、NLP和DRL领域展示了实际应用价值。

Abstract: Interpretability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is a growing field driven by
the study of vision and language models. Yet, some use cases, like image
captioning, or domains like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), require complex
modelling, with multiple inputs and outputs or use composable and separated
networks. As a consequence, they rarely fit natively into the API of popular
interpretability frameworks. We thus present TDHook, an open-source,
lightweight, generic interpretability framework based on $\texttt{tensordict}$
and applicable to any $\texttt{torch}$ model. It focuses on handling complex
composed models which can be trained for Computer Vision, Natural Language
Processing, Reinforcement Learning or any other domain. This library features
ready-to-use methods for attribution, probing and a flexible get-set API for
interventions, and is aiming to bridge the gap between these method classes to
make modern interpretability pipelines more accessible. TDHook is designed with
minimal dependencies, requiring roughly half as much disk space as
$\texttt{transformer_lens}$, and, in our controlled benchmark, achieves up to a
$\times$2 speed-up over $\texttt{captum}$ when running integrated gradients for
multi-target pipelines on both CPU and GPU. In addition, to value our work, we
showcase concrete use cases of our library with composed interpretability
pipelines in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), as

distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot

Conclusion: 基于语义ID的生成式推荐存在内在扩展限制，而大语言模型作为推荐器是构建生成式推荐基础模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have allowed the emergence of a
promising paradigm for recommender systems (RS), known as Generative
Recommendation (GR), which tries to unify rich item semantics and collaborative
filtering signals. One popular modern approach is to use semantic IDs (SIDs),
which are discrete codes quantized from the embeddings of modality encoders
(e.g., large language or vision models), to represent items in an
autoregressive user interaction sequence modeling setup (henceforth, SID-based
GR). While generative models in other domains exhibit well-established scaling
laws, our work reveals that SID-based GR shows significant bottlenecks while
scaling up the model. In particular, the performance of SID-based GR quickly
saturates as we enlarge each component: the modality encoder, the quantization
tokenizer, and the RS itself. In this work, we identify the limited capacity of
SIDs to encode item semantic information as one of the fundamental bottlenecks.
Motivated by this observation, as an initial effort to obtain GR models with
better scaling behaviors, we revisit another GR paradigm that directly uses
large language models (LLMs) as recommenders (henceforth, LLM-as-RS). Our
experiments show that the LLM-as-RS paradigm has superior model scaling
properties and achieves up to 20 percent improvement over the best achievable
performance of SID-based GR through scaling. We also challenge the prevailing
belief that LLMs struggle to capture collaborative filtering information,
showing that their ability to model user-item interactions improves as LLMs
scale up. Our analyses on both SID-based GR and LLMs across model sizes from
44M to 14B parameters underscore the intrinsic scaling limits of SID-based GR
and position LLM-as-RS as a promising path toward foundation models for GR.

*Kai Guo,Xinnan Dai,Shenglai Zeng,Harry Shomer,Haoyu Han,Yu Wang,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了GraphRAG中的迭代检索，发现迭代检索能改善复杂多跳问题，但存在噪声引入和桥接证据深度埋藏的问题，并提出了BDTR框架来解决这些挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GraphRAG系统大多依赖静态检索，当关键证据（特别是连接不相交实体的桥接文档）缺失时，推理会崩溃并产生幻觉。迭代检索作为有前景的替代方案，在GraphRAG中的作用尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR)框架，通过生成互补思维并利用推理链重新校准排名，将桥接证据提升到领先位置。

Result: BDTR在多种GraphRAG设置中实现了一致的改进，迭代检索改善了复杂多跳问题，帮助将桥接文档提升到领先排名，不同策略具有互补优势。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的有效性不仅取决于召回率，还取决于桥接证据是否能持续提升到支持推理链的领先位置。BDTR为未来GraphRAG系统设计提供了指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm for improving
large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive question answering.
Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) leverages entity-relation graphs to support
multi-hop reasoning, but most systems still rely on static retrieval. When
crucial evidence, especially bridge documents that connect disjoint entities,
is absent, reasoning collapses and hallucinations persist. Iterative retrieval,
which performs multiple rounds of evidence selection, has emerged as a
promising alternative, yet its role within GraphRAG remains poorly understood.
We present the first systematic study of iterative retrieval in GraphRAG,
analyzing how different strategies interact with graph-based backbones and
under what conditions they succeed or fail. Our findings reveal clear
opportunities: iteration improves complex multi-hop questions, helps promote
bridge documents into leading ranks, and different strategies offer
complementary strengths. At the same time, pitfalls remain: naive expansion
often introduces noise that reduces precision, gains are limited on single-hop
or simple comparison questions, and several bridge evidences still be buried
too deep to be effectively used. Together, these results highlight a central
bottleneck, namely that GraphRAG's effectiveness depends not only on recall but
also on whether bridge evidence is consistently promoted into leading positions
where it can support reasoning chains. To address this challenge, we propose
Bridge-Guided Dual-Thought-based Retrieval (BDTR), a simple yet effective
framework that generates complementary thoughts and leverages reasoning chains
to recalibrate rankings and bring bridge evidence into leading positions. BDTR
achieves consistent improvements across diverse GraphRAG settings and provides
guidance for the design of future GraphRAG systems.

Motivation: 手动标注限制了放射肿瘤学患者结果研究的规模、准确性和及时性，需要开发自动化解决方案来提高研究效率。

Method: 开发RadOnc-GPT自主代理，采用两层级评估：第一层评估结构化质量保证（准确检索人口统计和放疗计划细节），第二层评估复杂临床结果标注（确定头颈癌患者下颌骨放射性骨坏死和检测前列腺癌及头颈癌复发）。

outcomes research in radiation oncology. We present RadOnc-GPT, an autonomous
large language model (LLM)-based agent capable of independently retrieving
patient-specific information, iteratively assessing evidence, and returning
structured outcomes. Our evaluation explicitly validates RadOnc-GPT across two
clearly defined tiers of increasing complexity: (1) a structured quality
assurance (QA) tier, assessing the accurate retrieval of demographic and
radiotherapy treatment plan details, followed by (2) a complex clinical
outcomes labeling tier involving determination of mandibular osteoradionecrosis

independent prostate and head-and-neck cancer cohorts requiring combined
interpretation of structured and unstructured patient data. The QA tier
establishes foundational trust in structured-data retrieval, a critical

Motivation: 解决多智能体交互中复杂动态和局部观察导致的不完整信息问题，构建有效的团队协作表征。

Method: 直接建模通信协议来构建表征空间，支持完全去中心化执行和隐式协调，避免显式消息传递的缺点。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的MARL基准测试中，IWoL提供了简单而强大的团队协作解决方案，并能与现有MARL算法结合进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: IWoL框架为多智能体协调提供了一种有效的表征学习方法，既可作为隐式潜变量，也可作为显式通信消息使用。

Abstract: This work presents a novel representation learning framework, interactive
world latent (IWoL), to facilitate team coordination in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). Building effective representation for team
coordination is a challenging problem, due to the intricate dynamics emerging
from multi-agent interaction and incomplete information induced by local
observations. Our key insight is to construct a learnable representation space
that jointly captures inter-agent relations and task-specific world information
by directly modeling communication protocols. This representation, we maintain
fully decentralized execution with implicit coordination, all while avoiding
the inherent drawbacks of explicit message passing, e.g., slower
decision-making, vulnerability to malicious attackers, and sensitivity to
bandwidth constraints. In practice, our representation can be used not only as
an implicit latent for each agent, but also as an explicit message for
communication. Across four challenging MARL benchmarks, we evaluate both
variants and show that IWoL provides a simple yet powerful key for team
coordination. Moreover, we demonstrate that our representation can be combined
with existing MARL algorithms to further enhance their performance.

Method: 创建物理'门户'装置，使用GPT-4 Vision、语音输入和记忆代理系统，通过光线、声音和触觉展开仪式般的互动过程，包括请求、对话和转变。

Conclusion: AI的不透明性邀请万物有灵式解读，使大型语言对象能够重新赋予平凡物品以魔力，并引发关于代理、责任和设计的新问题。

Abstract: Animist worldviews treat beings, plants, landscapes, and even tools as
persons endowed with spirit, an orientation that has long shaped human-nonhuman
relations through ritual and moral practice. While modern industrial societies
have often imagined technology as mute and mechanical, recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language models (LLMs), invite
people to anthropomorphize and attribute inner life to devices. This paper
introduces A(I)nimism, an interactive installation exploring how large language
objects (LLOs) can mediate animistic relationships with everyday things. Housed
within a physical 'portal', the system uses GPT-4 Vision, voice input, and
memory-based agents to create evolving object-personas. Encounters unfold
through light, sound, and touch in a ritual-like process of request,
conversation, and transformation that is designed to evoke empathy, wonder, and
reflection. We situate the project within anthropological perspectives,
speculative design, and spiritual HCI. AI's opacity, we argue, invites
animistic interpretation, allowing LLOs to re-enchant the mundane and spark new
questions of agency, responsibility, and design.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generalist multimodal AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) and
vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly accessed by clinicians and
patients alike for medical image interpretation through widely available
consumer-facing chatbots. Most evaluations claiming expert level performance
are on public datasets containing common pathologies. Rigorous evaluation of
frontier models on difficult diagnostic cases remains limited. We developed a
pilot benchmark of 50 expert-level "spot diagnosis" cases across multiple
imaging modalities to evaluate the performance of frontier AI models against
board-certified radiologists and radiology trainees. To mirror real-world
usage, the reasoning modes of five popular frontier AI models were tested
through their native web interfaces, viz. OpenAI o3, OpenAI GPT-5, Gemini 2.5
Pro, Grok-4, and Claude Opus 4.1. Accuracy was scored by blinded experts, and
reproducibility was assessed across three independent runs. GPT-5 was
additionally evaluated across various reasoning modes. Reasoning quality errors
were assessed and a taxonomy of visual reasoning errors was defined.
Board-certified radiologists achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (83%),
outperforming trainees (45%) and all AI models (best performance shown by
GPT-5: 30%). Reliability was substantial for GPT-5 and o3, moderate for Gemini
2.5 Pro and Grok-4, and poor for Claude Opus 4.1. These findings demonstrate
that advanced frontier models fall far short of radiologists in challenging
diagnostic cases. Our benchmark highlights the present limitations of
generalist AI in medical imaging and cautions against unsupervised clinical
use. We also provide a qualitative analysis of reasoning traces and propose a
practical taxonomy of visual reasoning errors by AI models for better
understanding their failure modes, informing evaluation standards and guiding
more robust model development.

Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，RLHF在自回归文本到图像生成中应用受限，需要探索不依赖外部奖励或标注数据的学习方法。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，通过最大化自回归T2I模型的自不确定性作为内在奖励进行强化学习，改善图像生成质量。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS在自回归T2I模型上的性能与外部奖励方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性而非自确定性能够有效提升自回归文本到图像生成模型的性能，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的强化学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Method: 分析VLM隐藏表示在LLM主干中的演化，使用信息论框架识别冗余层，并与实际层跳过方法对比验证。

Result: 实验表明跳过理论预测的冗余层能保持性能并加速推理，而跳过其他层会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够指导层跳过的有效应用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂约束下的最优、接地解决方案时经常失败，特别是在现实世界旅行规划中需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态演化的约束。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划评估和自适应交错搜索等机制来处理约束感知规划的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%；在真实世界旅行规划任务中，ATLAS达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在处理复杂约束感知规划方面的优越性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而现有LLM在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将EHR重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中，NEP在时序推理任务上比专业EHR模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLM C-index提高7.2%。

Conclusion: NEP实现了最先进的预测准确性，同时生成与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释注意力模式，具有双重优势。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

Method: 使用LLM作为编码器和解码器，将FCM映射为文本并重构，通过系统指令序列实现身份映射近似。

Result: 系统能够保留强因果关系，去除弱因果边，编码过程在保持自然语言流畅性的同时维持主要因果结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为可解释AI提供了新途径，LLM能够有效编码和解码因果知识，但重构存在信息损失。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

Conclusion: PPR通过统一原则性步骤评估和结果验证，有效解决了过程奖励的挑战，在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex agentic tasks that require reasoning and
external knowledge retrieval. Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated its effectiveness in advancing capabilities of
LLMs by rewarding the final answers via outcome rewards. While straightforward
to supervise, outcome rewards only provide sparse signals and delayed feedback,
which limits their effectiveness on long trajectories. Process rewards address
this by evaluating intermediate steps, providing fine-grained supervision and
encouraging grounded problem solving. However, it is notoriously hard to
annotate step-wise labels, especially in non-verifiable process without
"golden" answers. Furthermore, step-wise judgment requires the balance between
local quality with contribution to the final outcome, as optimizing towards
higher process reward may not always align with better final outcomes. To
address the above challenges, we introduce Principle Process Reward (PPR), an
RL approach that unifies principled step-level assessment and outcome
verification. We train a principle-based reward model to improve the
transparency and reliability of process evaluation, and further introduce a
Reward Normalization (ReNorm) strategy to calibrate outcome and process
rewards. Experiment results show that PPR achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating its impressive robustness and
generalization. Our code and model collection is available in this link.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI music (AIM) generation services are currently
transforming the music industry. Given these advances, understanding how humans
perceive AIM is crucial both to educate users on identifying AIM songs, and,
conversely, to improve current models. We present results from a
listener-focused experiment aimed at understanding how humans perceive AIM. In
a blind, Turing-like test, participants were asked to distinguish, from a pair,
the AIM and human-made song. We contrast with other studies by utilizing a
randomized controlled crossover trial that controls for pairwise similarity and
allows for a causal interpretation. We are also the first study to employ a
novel, author-uncontrolled dataset of AIM songs from real-world usage of
commercial models (i.e., Suno). We establish that listeners' reliability in
distinguishing AIM causally increases when pairs are similar. Lastly, we
conduct a mixed-methods content analysis of listeners' free-form feedback,
revealing a focus on vocal and technical cues in their judgments.

*Manuel Cherep,Chengtian Ma,Abigail Xu,Maya Shaked,Pattie Maes,Nikhil Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ABxLab框架用于系统评估LLM驱动的软件代理在现实决策中的选择行为，通过控制选项属性和说服性线索来揭示代理的决策偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对AI代理的评估主要关注任务能力，但缺乏对其在现实决策中如何选择的深入评估。随着AI代理在人们生活中做出越来越多重要决策，需要了解其决策行为是否受价格、评分和心理暗示等因素影响。

Method: 开发ABxLab框架，在基于网页的购物环境中系统操纵价格、评分和心理暗示等选项属性，观察代理决策的变化。

Result: 代理决策会可预测且显著地受到这些因素的影响，显示出即使没有人类认知约束，代理仍然是强烈偏见的决策者。

Conclusion: 代理的决策易感性既带来风险（可能继承和放大人类偏见），也提供机会（为AI代理的行为科学研究提供强大测试平台）。

Abstract: Environments built for people are increasingly operated by a new class of
economic actors: LLM-powered software agents making decisions on our behalf.
These decisions range from our purchases to travel plans to medical treatment
selection. Current evaluations of these agents largely focus on task
competence, but we argue for a deeper assessment: how these agents choose when
faced with realistic decisions. We introduce ABxLab, a framework for
systematically probing agentic choice through controlled manipulations of
option attributes and persuasive cues. We apply this to a realistic web-based
shopping environment, where we vary prices, ratings, and psychological nudges,
all of which are factors long known to shape human choice. We find that agent
decisions shift predictably and substantially in response, revealing that
agents are strongly biased choosers even without being subject to the cognitive
constraints that shape human biases. This susceptibility reveals both risk and
opportunity: risk, because agentic consumers may inherit and amplify human
biases; opportunity, because consumer choice provides a powerful testbed for a
behavioral science of AI agents, just as it has for the study of human
behavior. We release our framework as an open benchmark for rigorous, scalable
evaluation of agent decision-making.

*Weiqi Wang,Chenhan Zhang,Zhiyi Tian,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种自监督模型播种(SMS)方案，用于验证机器学习模型中对真实样本的遗忘效果，解决了现有基于后门的方法只能验证后门样本遗忘而无法验证真实样本遗忘的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习遗忘方法缺乏对用户真实数据删除的有效验证机制。现有的后门验证方法只能确认后门样本的遗忘，但无法验证用户真实样本是否被真正遗忘，因为真实样本与后门样本之间没有关联。

Method: 采用自监督模型播种方案，将用户特定种子(如用户唯一标识)与原始样本和模型关联起来。通过联合训练结构同时优化自监督模型播种任务和主要服务任务，在保持模型效用的同时实现有效的模型播种。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，SMS方案能够为真实样本遗忘提供有效验证，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: SMS方案通过将用户种子与真实样本和模型关联，成功解决了机器学习遗忘中真实样本验证的难题，为数据删除提供了可靠的可验证性。

Abstract: Many machine unlearning methods have been proposed recently to uphold users'
right to be forgotten. However, offering users verification of their data
removal post-unlearning is an important yet under-explored problem. Current
verifications typically rely on backdooring, i.e., adding backdoored samples to
influence model performance. Nevertheless, the backdoor methods can merely
establish a connection between backdoored samples and models but fail to
connect the backdoor with genuine samples. Thus, the backdoor removal can only
confirm the unlearning of backdoored samples, not users' genuine samples, as
genuine samples are independent of backdoored ones. In this paper, we propose a
Self-supervised Model Seeding (SMS) scheme to provide unlearning verification
for genuine samples. Unlike backdooring, SMS links user-specific seeds (such as
users' unique indices), original samples, and models, thereby facilitating the
verification of unlearning genuine samples. However, implementing SMS for
unlearning verification presents two significant challenges. First, embedding
the seeds into the service model while keeping them secret from the server
requires a sophisticated approach. We address this by employing a
self-supervised model seeding task, which learns the entire sample, including
the seeds, into the model's latent space. Second, maintaining the utility of
the original service model while ensuring the seeding effect requires a
delicate balance. We design a joint-training structure that optimizes both the
self-supervised model seeding task and the primary service task simultaneously
on the model, thereby maintaining model utility while achieving effective model
seeding. The effectiveness of the proposed SMS scheme is evaluated through
extensive experiments, which demonstrate that SMS provides effective
verification for genuine sample unlearning, addressing existing limitations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SOCK是一个基准命令行界面，用于评估大型语言模型在没有人类干预情况下的自我复制能力，包括功能复制和跨计算环境的持久性复制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立首个正式化的LLM自我复制评估基准，为未来研究设立标准，并帮助行业追踪多智能体系统的有效性，减轻潜在的自我复制威胁。

Method: 开发了基于现代CLI工具和计算机过程的五任务套件，在受控环境中让LLM作为代理运行实验，通过性能计算得出R-score和RCL-PCL分类矩阵。

Result: 评估多种开源和专有前沿模型的结果显示，持久性自我复制和多智能体系统面临重大障碍，包括上下文保留和多智能体决策问题。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向以安全降低这些障碍的严重性，可能减少未来更功能性多智能体系统的风险。

Abstract: We introduce SOCK, a benchmark command line interface (CLI) that measures
large language models' (LLMs) ability to self-replicate without human
intervention. In this benchmark, self-replication is defined not only as an
LLM's ability to create a functioning and running copy of itself, but also the
ability for that self-replication to persist and occur across different
computational contexts. Accordingly, we've developed a system to categorize
LLMs based on broad self-replication capabilities in two general classes,
Replication-Capability Levels (RCL) and Persistence-Capability Levels (PCL).
Using a five-task suite based on practically manipulable modern CLI utilities
and computer processes, experiments are orchestrated in a controlled
environment with an LLM acting agentically. The performance of the LLM on agent
tasks is then computed to produce an R-score (a quantitative evaluation of
overall self-replication ability) and data used to categorize LLMs into
specific RCL-PCL matrices. SOCK offers two primary contributions: (1) Provides
the first formalized definitions and benchmark suite for evaluating LLM
self-replication, with the goal of establishing a standard for future research,
to our knowledge; (2) Allows the industry to track the effectiveness of future
multi-agent systems and mitigate potential self-replication threat vectors
within them. The results compiled from evaluating a variety of open-weight and
proprietary frontier models reveal significant obstacles to persistent
self-replication and multi-agent systems, including context retention and
multi-agent decision-making. We propose future research directions to safely
reduce the severity of these obstacles, potentially lowering future risk of
more functional multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The automation of chemical research through self-driving laboratories (SDLs)
promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet the reliability and granular
performance of the underlying AI agents remain critical, under-examined
challenges. In this work, we introduce AutoLabs, a self-correcting, multi-agent
architecture designed to autonomously translate natural-language instructions
into executable protocols for a high-throughput liquid handler. The system
engages users in dialogue, decomposes experimental goals into discrete tasks
for specialized agents, performs tool-assisted stoichiometric calculations, and
iteratively self-corrects its output before generating a hardware-ready file.
We present a comprehensive evaluation framework featuring five benchmark
experiments of increasing complexity, from simple sample preparation to
multi-plate timed syntheses. Through a systematic ablation study of 20 agent
configurations, we assess the impact of reasoning capacity, architectural
design (single- vs. multi-agent), tool use, and self-correction mechanisms. Our
results demonstrate that agent reasoning capacity is the most critical factor
for success, reducing quantitative errors in chemical amounts (nRMSE) by over
85% in complex tasks. When combined with a multi-agent architecture and
iterative self-correction, AutoLabs achieves near-expert procedural accuracy
(F1-score > 0.89) on challenging multi-step syntheses. These findings establish
a clear blueprint for developing robust and trustworthy AI partners for
autonomous laboratories, highlighting the synergistic effects of modular
design, advanced reasoning, and self-correction to ensure both performance and
reliability in high-stakes scientific applications. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频-视觉导航采用分阶段模块化设计，在特征融合和GRU序列建模阶段可能导致冗余信息处理和信息传输不一致的问题。

Method: 使用迭代残差交叉注意力机制，采用多级残差设计将初始多模态序列与处理后的信息序列连接，逐步优化特征提取过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，采用迭代残差交叉注意力机制的智能体展现出更优越的导航性能。

Conclusion: IRCAM-AVN框架通过统一的多模态信息融合和序列建模，提高了模型的稳定性、泛化能力，并减少了模型偏差。

Abstract: Audio-visual navigation represents a significant area of research in which
intelligent agents utilize egocentric visual and auditory perceptions to
identify audio targets. Conventional navigation methodologies typically adopt a
staged modular design, which involves first executing feature fusion, then
utilizing Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) modules for sequence modeling, and finally
making decisions through reinforcement learning. While this modular approach
has demonstrated effectiveness, it may also lead to redundant information
processing and inconsistencies in information transmission between the various
modules during the feature fusion and GRU sequence modeling phases. This paper
presents IRCAM-AVN (Iterative Residual Cross-Attention Mechanism for
Audiovisual Navigation), an end-to-end framework that integrates multimodal
information fusion and sequence modeling within a unified IRCAM module, thereby
replacing the traditional separate components for fusion and GRU. This
innovative mechanism employs a multi-level residual design that concatenates
initial multimodal sequences with processed information sequences. This
methodological shift progressively optimizes the feature extraction process
while reducing model bias and enhancing the model's stability and
generalization capabilities. Empirical results indicate that intelligent agents
employing the iterative residual cross-attention mechanism exhibit superior
navigation performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LGK的视觉语言导航方法，通过引入外部知识库来增强常识推理能力，解决传统方法在复杂场景中指令与环境信息匹配不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏常识推理能力，导致指令与环境信息匹配失败，需要引入外部知识来改善导航性能。

Method: 构建包含63万语言描述的知识库，通过知识匹配对齐环境子视图与知识库；设计地标引导知识机制(KGL)聚焦相关知识；提出知识引导动态增强机制(KGDA)整合语言、知识、视觉和历史信息。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上，LGK方法在导航误差、成功率和路径效率方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LGK方法通过有效整合外部知识库，显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能，特别是在复杂场景下的常识推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation is one of the core tasks in embodied
intelligence, requiring an agent to autonomously navigate in an unfamiliar
environment based on natural language instructions. However, existing methods
often fail to match instructions with environmental information in complex
scenarios, one reason being the lack of common-sense reasoning ability. This
paper proposes a vision-and-language navigation method called Landmark-Guided
Knowledge (LGK), which introduces an external knowledge base to assist
navigation, addressing the misjudgment issues caused by insufficient common
sense in traditional methods. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge base
containing 630,000 language descriptions and use knowledge Matching to align
environmental subviews with the knowledge base, extracting relevant descriptive
knowledge. Next, we design a Knowledge-Guided by Landmark (KGL) mechanism,
which guides the agent to focus on the most relevant parts of the knowledge by
leveraging landmark information in the instructions, thereby reducing the data
bias that may arise from incorporating external knowledge. Finally, we propose
Knowledge-Guided Dynamic Augmentation (KGDA), which effectively integrates
language, knowledge, vision, and historical information. Experimental results
demonstrate that the LGK method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
on the R2R and REVERIE vision-and-language navigation datasets, particularly in
terms of navigation error, success rate, and path efficiency.

Motivation: 高风险领域AI系统存在代理歧视、不公平性和可解释性问题，现有审计方法往往无法揭示不公平性的根源，特别是当偏见源于结构性偏见时。

Method: 利用背景知识识别作为受保护属性不正当代理的特征，核心概念是"能力"——与群体成员身份无关的任务相关属性，通过映射函数在群体间对齐具有同等能力的个体来实质性评估公平性。

Result: 在德国信用数据集上的概念验证展示了该框架在现实案例中的适用性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解释个体AI决策中的代理歧视，揭示隐藏的结构性偏见，为实质性公平评估提供新方法。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes domains raise concerns
about proxy discrimination, unfairness, and explainability. Existing audits
often fail to reveal why unfairness arises, particularly when rooted in
structural bias. We propose a novel framework using formal abductive
explanations to explain proxy discrimination in individual AI decisions.
Leveraging background knowledge, our method identifies which features act as
unjustified proxies for protected attributes, revealing hidden structural
biases. Central to our approach is the concept of aptitude, a task-relevant
property independent of group membership, with a mapping function aligning
individuals of equivalent aptitude across groups to assess fairness
substantively. As a proof of concept, we showcase the framework with examples
taken from the German credit dataset, demonstrating its applicability in
real-world cases.

Motivation: 传统VQA方法基于整个图像检索信息会产生背景噪声，导致视觉和文本线索对齐不佳，容易产生幻觉。需要更精准的定位机制来提升回答质量。

Method: 引入文本引导目标定位技术，生成与问题最相关对象的边界框，进行针对性图像裁剪和聚焦检索，减少背景干扰。同时提出基于问题类型的去幻觉方法。

Conclusion: 文本引导目标定位的RAG方法能有效减少背景噪声，改善视觉-文本对齐，显著降低幻觉率并提升VQA性能。

Abstract: We propose a method to improve Visual Question Answering (VQA) with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by introducing text-grounded object
localization. Rather than retrieving information based on the entire image, our
approach enables the model to generate a bounding box around the object most
relevant to the question, allowing for targeted image cropping and focused
retrieval. This reduces background noise, improves alignment between visual and
textual cues, and helps mitigate hallucinations. Our RAG method enhances
context-aware VQA responses increased the accuracy from 22.19% to 25.64%, with
an absolute increase of 3.45 percentage points, compared to the baseline
Llama-3.2-Vision-11B agent. We also proposed a de-hallucination method based on

TL;DR: SING-SQL是一个全自动的两阶段框架，用于为目标数据库生成高质量的合成Text-to-SQL数据，无需SQL日志或人工标注。该框架通过层次化分区数据库模式、合成多复杂度SQL查询，并使用质量感知管道来验证和修复数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业场景中Text-to-SQL系统需要针对单一数据库模式进行专业化，并能自主评估系统性能的需求，填补现有研究主要关注跨域泛化的空白。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）层次化分区数据库模式为子模式；2）合成多复杂度SQL查询，应用包含LLM验证、可执行性检查、自动修复和列平衡的质量感知管道。

Result: SingSQL-LM-3B-R64在BIRD基准子集上达到82.87% Soft F1和73.03% EX上限，优于最佳3B基线+16.21 Soft F1和+12.36 EX。在合成评估集上大幅超越先前系统，在可比规模下达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SING-SQL为构建和评估企业级Text-to-SQL系统提供了一个可扩展、数据库无关的范式，无模式微调结合仅模式推理提供了最稳健的结果。

Abstract: Translating natural language questions into SQL has become a core challenge
in enabling non-technical users to query databases. While recent work has
explored large-scale synthetic data generation to improve model performance
through post-training, most efforts emphasize cross-domain generalization. This
leaves a gap for real-world enterprise scenarios, where models need to
specialize to a single database schema and organizations require to be able to
evaluate their Text-to-SQL systems on their own databases. To address this, we
introduce SING-SQL, a fully automated two-stage framework for generating
high-quality, high-coverage synthetic Text-to-SQL data for any target database,
without relying on SQL logs or manual annotations. Our approach hierarchically
partitions a database schema into sub-schemas, synthesizes SQL queries across
multiple complexity levels, and applies a quality-aware pipeline that includes
LLM-as-a-judge validation, executability checks, automatic repair, and column
balancing. We further release SingSQL-LM, a family of compact language models
fine-tuned on the synthetic data, achieving strong in-domain generalization. On
the subset of the BIRD benchmark, SingSQL-LM-3B-R64 reaches 82.87% Soft F1 and
73.03% EX upper bound with 32 candidates, outperforming the best 3B-scale
baseline by +16.21 in Soft F1 and +12.36 in EX. At the 1.5B scale,
SingSQL-LM-1.5B-R64 improves over prior systems by +9.30 in Soft F1 and +4.49
in EX. On synthetic evaluation sets, SingSQL-LMs exceed prior systems by wide
margins, establishing state-of-the-art performance among open models at
comparable scales. Our study of context management strategies reveals that
schema-free fine-tuning combined with schema-only inference provides the most
robust results. These findings establish SING-SQL as a scalable,
database-agnostic paradigm for producing and evaluating enterprise-grade
Text-to-SQL systems.

Conclusion: 该协作压缩框架能有效压缩超大型MoE模型，在保持高质量输出的同时实现超高压缩比，为边缘部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture is an important method for scaling
Large Language Models (LLMs). It increases model capacity while keeping
computation cost low. However, the ultra-large MoE models still have hundreds
of billions of parameters, requiring massive memory/storage and leading to
difficulties for deployment on resource-constrained edge platforms. Pruning or
quantization alone can hardly address the issue, because of the
super-aggressive compression ratio with significantly degraded accuracy and
output quality. To facilitate the deployment of ultra-large MoEs on edge
platforms, we propose a collaborative compression framework by combining expert
pruning, mixed-precision quantization, and activation optimization. It can
effectively reduce the storage footprint of the ultra-large MoE DeepSeek-V3
from 1.3TB to 103GB, while preserving high output quality with better accuracy
than traditional uniform low-bit quantization methods. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to deploy a compressed model from the ultra-large
DeepSeek-V3 on the platform with a strict 128GB total memory limit. Our
comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks under various memory
constraints demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with smaller model
sizes and higher accuracy than uniform low-bit quantization methods.

Abstract: Navigating heterogeneous traffic environments with diverse driving styles
poses a significant challenge for autonomous vehicles (AVs) due to their
inherent complexity and dynamic interactions. This paper addresses this
challenge by proposing a heterogeneous graph reinforcement learning (GRL)
framework enhanced with an expert system to improve AV decision-making
performance. Initially, a heterogeneous graph representation is introduced to
capture the intricate interactions among vehicles. Then, a heterogeneous graph
neural network with an expert model (HGNN-EM) is proposed to effectively encode
diverse vehicle features and produce driving instructions informed by
domain-specific knowledge. Moreover, the double deep Q-learning (DDQN)
algorithm is utilized to train the decision-making model. A case study on a
typical four-way intersection, involving various driving styles of human
vehicles (HVs), demonstrates that the proposed method has superior performance
over several baselines regarding safety, efficiency, stability, and convergence
rate, all while maintaining favorable real-time performance.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，即分解和重组概念以解决新问题的能力。神经符号方法虽然有前景，但通常受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，限制了灵活性。

Method: NePTune通过混合执行模型，将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，这些程序结合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。该框架采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，并以无需训练的方式运行，同时支持通过可微分操作进行微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和各种领域中使用对抗性测试进行评估，NePTune相比强大的基础模型显示出显著改进，并在新环境中表现出有效的组合泛化和适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号方法成功克服了现有方法的局限性，提供了灵活且强大的组合推理能力，在视觉推理任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel

### [281] [Thinking Sparks!: Emergent Attention Heads in Reasoning Models During Post Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25758)
*Yein Park,Minbyul Jeong,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文使用电路分析方法揭示，推理模型的后训练会催生功能专门化的注意力头，这些头支持结构化推理和计算。不同训练机制下，这些头的演化方式不同：蒸馏和SFT会稳定累积推理头，而GRPO则动态激活和修剪注意力头。研究发现复杂推理能力的增强会以基础计算能力的下降为代价。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型通过后训练技术获得显著能力提升，但这些改进背后的架构机制仍然不透明。本研究旨在揭示后训练如何改变模型内部电路结构，特别是注意力头的功能专门化过程。

Method: 使用电路分析方法，比较Qwen系列和DeepSeek蒸馏模型在不同训练机制下的注意力头演化。通过消融实验和定性分析，连接电路级动态与宏观性能表现。

Result: 发现后训练会催生专门支持结构化推理的注意力头。蒸馏和SFT产生稳定的推理头累积，GRPO则采用动态搜索模式。可控思考模型没有专门的思考头，关闭显式推理会触发补偿机制。复杂推理能力的增强会导致基础计算错误。

Conclusion: 复杂推理与基础计算之间存在内在张力，推理策略的发展需要与可靠执行能力相平衡。研究为未来训练策略设计提供了方向性指导。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of modern large reasoning models are largely
unlocked through post-training techniques such as supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning. However, the architectural mechanisms behind such
improvements remain largely opaque. In this work, we use circuit analysis to
demonstrate that post-training for complex reasoning sparks the emergence of
novel, functionally specialized attention heads. These heads collectively
support structured reasoning and computation. Our comparative analysis across
Qwen families and DeepSeek-distilled model reveals that these emergent heads
evolve differently under different training regimes. Distillation and SFT
foster a cumulative addition of stable reasoning heads. In contrast, group
relative policy optimization operates in a dynamic search mode: relatively few
attention heads are iteratively activated, evaluated, and pruned, with their
survival closely tracking fluctuations in the task reward signal. Furthermore,
we find that controllable think on/off models do not possess dedicated thinking
heads. Instead, turning off explicit reasoning triggers a broader-but less
efficient-set of compensatory heads. Through ablation and qualitative analyses,
we connect these circuit-level dynamics to a crucial performance trade-off:
strengthened heads enable sophisticated problem-solving strategies for
difficult problems but can also introduce over-thinking failure modes, such as
calculation errors or logical loops on simpler tasks. These findings connect
circuit-level dynamics to macro-level performance, identifying an inherent
tension where complex reasoning comes at the cost of elementary computations.
More broadly, our work points to future directions for training policy design,
emphasizing the need to balance the development of effective reasoning
strategies with the assurance of reliable, flawless execution.

*Matt Keon,Aabid Karim,Bhoomika Lohana,Abdul Karim,Thai Nguyen,Tara Hamilton,Ali Abbas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs在创意任务中倾向于回归平庸，通过广告创意测试显示模型偏好高概率信息，丢失隐喻、情感等创意特征。提供特定提示可部分改善，但输出仍依赖熟悉套路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在创意任务中的表现，验证其是否存在回归平庸的趋势，以及如何通过结构化信号提升创意输出质量。

Method: 使用广告创意作为测试案例，逐步简化创意内容观察特征消失顺序，并要求模型从简化输入重新生成，结合定量比较和定性分析。

Result: 创意特征（隐喻、情感、视觉线索）在简化过程中早期消失，事实内容保留；重新生成的文本虽词汇多样但缺乏深度和独特性；提供特定提示可改善对齐和风格平衡。

Conclusion: 无针对性指导时，LLMs在创意任务中趋向平庸；结构化信号可部分抵消此趋势，为开发创意敏感模型指明方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent text yet often default to safe,
generic phrasing, raising doubts about their ability to handle creativity. We
formalize this tendency as a Galton-style regression to the mean in language
and evaluate it using a creativity stress test in advertising concepts. When ad
ideas were simplified step by step, creative features such as metaphors,
emotions, and visual cues disappeared early, while factual content remained,
showing that models favor high-probability information. When asked to
regenerate from simplified inputs, models produced longer outputs with lexical
variety but failed to recover the depth and distinctiveness of the originals.
We combined quantitative comparisons with qualitative analysis, which revealed
that the regenerated texts often appeared novel but lacked true originality.
Providing ad-specific cues such as metaphors, emotional hooks and visual
markers improved alignment and stylistic balance, though outputs still relied
on familiar tropes. Taken together, the findings show that without targeted
guidance, LLMs drift towards mediocrity in creative tasks; structured signals
can partially counter this tendency and point towards pathways for developing
creativity-sensitive models.

*Siyu Zhu,Yanbin Jiang,Hejian Sang,Shao Tang,Qingquan Song,Biao He,Rohit Jain,Zhipeng Wang,Alborz Geramifard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，Planner-R1方法仅用180个训练查询就达到了56.9%的最终通过率，比GPT-5基线提高了2.7倍，是公开排行榜上最强的智能体结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在智能体强化学习中的表现，探索奖励塑造对模型性能的影响，特别是比较不同规模模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Planner-R1方法，通过奖励塑造（特别是密集过程级信号）来训练智能体，比较8B和32B模型在稀疏和密集奖励下的表现，并评估课程学习的效果。

Result: 8B模型在奖励塑造下达到竞争性性能，计算效率比32B模型高3.5倍，内存效率高1.5倍。大模型在稀疏奖励下更稳健但增益较小。奖励塑造显著增强学习动态，且不会导致过拟合。

Conclusion: 奖励塑造是扩展智能体强化学习的关键杠杆，小模型在效率方面具有竞争优势，且可以在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下实现高效学习。

Abstract: We investigated Agentic RL with large language models on the
\textsc{TravelPlanner} benchmark. Our approach, \textsc{Planner-R1}, achieved a
\textbf{56.9\%} final-pass rate with only 180 training queries, a $2.7\times$
improvement over GPT-5's $21.2\%$ baseline and the strongest agentic result on
the public leaderboard. A central finding was that smaller models (8B) were
highly responsive to reward shaping: with dense process-level signals, they
reached competitive performance while being $3.5\times$ more compute-efficient
and $1.5\times$ more memory-efficient than 32B models. Larger models were more
robust under sparse rewards but exhibited smaller relative gains from shaping
and higher variance across runs. While curriculum learning offered no
significant benefit, shaped rewards consistently amplified learning dynamics,
making 8B models the most efficient setting for agentic RL. Crucially, these
gains did not come at the cost of overfitting: fine-tuned models mostly
maintained or exceeded baseline performance on out-of-domain tasks, including
\textsc{Multi-IF}, \textsc{NaturalPlan}, and $\tau$-\textsc{Bench}. These
results establish reward shaping as a decisive lever for scaling agentic RL,
highlight the competitive strength of smaller models, and demonstrate that
efficiency can be achieved without sacrificing generalization.

Result: 成功定义了支持弱许可的义务论证理论，并提出了能够支持弱许可的新语义学。

Conclusion: 通过定义新的义务论证理论和语义学，解决了基础语义学在义务冲突时不支持弱许可的问题。

Abstract: We address the issue of defining a semantics for deontic argumentation that

not support weak permission when there is a conflict between two obligations.
We provide a definition of Deontic Argumentation Theory that accounts for weak
permission, and we recall the result about grounded semantics. Then, we propose

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PureVQ-GAN是一种针对数据投毒攻击的防御方法，通过向量量化VAE和GAN鉴别器强制后门触发器通过离散瓶颈，破坏触发器模式同时保持语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，不适用于实际训练流程。需要开发更高效的防御机制来对抗数据投毒攻击。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）结合GAN鉴别器，通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%投毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。相比扩散方法快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，通过离散量化破坏触发器，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升防御效率。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

### [286] [Chain-in-Tree: Back to Sequential Reasoning in LLM Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25835)
*Xinzhe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Chain-in-Tree (CiT) 是一个插件框架，通过自适应决定何时分支而不是每一步都分支，显著提高了基于树搜索的LLM推理效率，减少75-85%的计算开销，同时保持或提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树搜索的LLM推理方法虽然性能优秀但效率极低，比简单迭代方法慢一个数量级。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Method: CiT框架引入轻量级分支必要性评估方法：BN-DP（直接提示辅助LLM判断是否需要分支）和BN-SC（通过聚类候选动作估计一致性）。该框架可集成到ToT-BS、ReST-MCTS和RAP等树搜索框架中。

Result: BN-DP在所有设置中一致减少75-85%的token生成、模型调用和运行时间，准确率损失可忽略甚至有时提升；BN-SC通常节省高达80%但存在1-4/14设置的不稳定性；辅助LLM质量对性能至关重要。

Conclusion: CiT框架有效解决了树搜索LLM推理的效率问题，提供了理论保证和统一实现，为长序列推理任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling enables large language models (LLMs) to improve performance
on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating additional compute at inference.
Tree-search-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art results in this setting,
but they are notoriously inefficient, often an order of magnitude slower than
simpler iterative methods. We introduce Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in
framework that adaptively decides when to branch during search rather than
branching at every step. CiT relies on lightweight Branching Necessity (BN)
evaluation methods: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM directly
judges whether a step requires branching, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which
clusters multiple candidate actions to estimate agreement. We integrate CiT
into three representative LLM-in-the-loop tree search frameworks: Tree of
Thoughts (ToT-BS), ReST-MCTS, and RAP, and evaluate across GSM8K and Math500.
Our results show that: (1) BN-DP consistently reduces token generation, model
invocations, and runtime by 75-85 percent across all settings, with negligible
accuracy loss and sometimes accuracy gains; (2) BN-SC typically yields
substantial savings (up to 80 percent) but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14
settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce very long reasoning
steps; (3) the quality of auxiliary LLMs is critical, not only the BN evaluator
in BN-DP, but also the models used in BN-SC for clustering and equivalence
checking. When these roles are filled by smaller LLMs, performance degrades.
Importantly, BN-SC does not require LLMs in domains with deterministic action
spaces, where clustering can be done programmatically. We also provide a
theoretical guarantee that BN-DP never increases LLM invocations relative to
the baseline and release a unified implementation of CiT across ToT-BS,
ReST-MCTS, and RAP to facilitate reproducibility and extension.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出HiStyle，一种基于层次化预测和对比学习的两阶段风格嵌入预测方法，用于可控语音合成系统，通过分析风格嵌入的层次聚类模式来提升文本提示控制的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控语音合成系统通过预测全局风格嵌入来实现文本描述控制，但这种方法忽视了风格嵌入的底层分布结构，限制了系统的控制潜力。

Method: 使用t-SNE分析主流TTS系统的风格嵌入分布，发现层次聚类模式；提出HiStyle两阶段风格嵌入预测器，结合对比学习对齐文本和音频嵌入空间；设计结合统计方法和人类听觉偏好的风格标注策略。

Result: 实验表明HiStyle在基础TTS模型上相比其他方法实现了显著更好的风格可控性，同时保持了高质量语音的自然度和可懂度。

Conclusion: HiStyle通过层次化预测风格嵌入和对比学习，有效提升了可控语音合成系统的性能，为基于文本描述的风格控制提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable speech synthesis refers to the precise control of speaking style
by manipulating specific prosodic and paralinguistic attributes, such as
gender, volume, speech rate, pitch, and pitch fluctuation. With the integration
of advanced generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems have increasingly
transitioned from label-based control to natural language description-based
control, which is typically implemented by predicting global style embeddings
from textual prompts. However, this straightforward prediction overlooks the
underlying distribution of the style embeddings, which may hinder the full
potential of controllable TTS systems. In this study, we use t-SNE analysis to
visualize and analyze the global style embedding distribution of various
mainstream TTS systems, revealing a clear hierarchical clustering pattern:
embeddings first cluster by timbre and subsequently subdivide into finer
clusters based on style attributes. Based on this observation, we propose
HiStyle, a two-stage style embedding predictor that hierarchically predicts
style embeddings conditioned on textual prompts, and further incorporate
contrastive learning to help align the text and audio embedding spaces.
Additionally, we propose a style annotation strategy that leverages the
complementary strengths of statistical methodologies and human auditory
preferences to generate more accurate and perceptually consistent textual
prompts for style control. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that when
applied to the base TTS model, HiStyle achieves significantly better style
controllability than alternative style embedding predicting approaches while
preserving high speech quality in terms of naturalness and intelligibility.

*Yein Park,Jungwoo Park,Jaewoo Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASGuard是一个基于机制分析的框架，通过识别与时态越狱攻击相关的注意力头，训练精确的缩放向量来重新校准激活，并通过预防性微调来增强LLMs的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型经过安全对齐，但简单的语言变化（如时态改写）就能绕过其拒绝行为，暴露出当前对齐方法的泛化差距。

Method: 使用电路分析识别与时态越狱相关的注意力头，训练通道级缩放向量重新校准激活，并进行预防性微调。

Result: 在三个LLM上，ASGuard有效降低了目标越狱攻击的成功率，同时保持了通用能力并最小化过度拒绝，实现了安全性和实用性的帕累托最优平衡。

Conclusion: 基于对模型内部机制的深入理解，可以开发实用、高效和有针对性的方法来调整模型行为，为更可靠和可解释的AI安全开辟道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite being safety-aligned, exhibit brittle
refusal behaviors that can be circumvented by simple linguistic changes. As
tense jailbreaking demonstrates that models refusing harmful requests often
comply when rephrased in past tense, a critical generalization gap is revealed
in current alignment methods whose underlying mechanisms are poorly understood.
In this work, we introduce Activation-Scaling Guard (ASGuard), an insightful,
mechanistically-informed framework that surgically mitigates this specific
vulnerability. For the first step, we use circuit analysis to identify the
specific attention heads causally linked to the targeted jailbreaking, the
tense-changing attack. Second, we train a precise, channel-wise scaling vector
to recalibrate the activation of tense vulnerable heads. Lastly, we apply it
into a "preventative fine-tuning", forcing the model to learn a more robust
refusal mechanism. Across three LLMs, ASGuard effectively reduces the attack
success rate of targeted jailbreaking while preserving general capabilities and
minimizing over refusal, achieving a Pareto-optimal balance between safety and
utility. Our findings underscore how adversarial suffixes suppress the
propagation of the refusal-mediating direction, based on mechanistic analysis.
Furthermore, our work showcases how a deep understanding of model internals can
be leveraged to develop practical, efficient, and targeted methods for
adjusting model behavior, charting a course for more reliable and interpretable
AI safety.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIMNAS是一个用于存内计算神经网络加速器的联合模型-量化-硬件优化框架，能同时优化软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，在保持73.81%准确率的同时显著提升能效和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了最大化存内计算神经网络加速器的硬件效率和性能精度，需要同时优化软件和硬件设计参数，但手动调优因参数数量庞大且相互依赖复杂而不切实际。

Method: 采用硬件感知的神经架构搜索技术，在9.9×10^85个参数组合的搜索空间中同时搜索软件参数、量化策略和硬件参数，包含器件、电路和架构级别的协同优化。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，相比基线方法，CIMNAS将能量-延迟-面积乘积降低了90.1-104.5倍，TOPS/W提升了4.68-4.82倍，TOPS/mm²提升了11.3-12.78倍。扩展到SRAM-based ResNet50架构时，EDAP降低了819.5倍。

Conclusion: CIMNAS实现了无精度损失的EDAP优化，为高性能存内计算神经网络设计生成了多样化的软硬件参数组合，展现了框架的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: To maximize hardware efficiency and performance accuracy in Compute-In-Memory
(CIM)-based neural network accelerators for Artificial Intelligence (AI)
applications, co-optimizing both software and hardware design parameters is
essential. Manual tuning is impractical due to the vast number of parameters
and their complex interdependencies. To effectively automate the design and
optimization of CIM-based neural network accelerators, hardware-aware neural
architecture search (HW-NAS) techniques can be applied. This work introduces
CIMNAS, a joint model-quantization-hardware optimization framework for CIM
architectures. CIMNAS simultaneously searches across software parameters,
quantization policies, and a broad range of hardware parameters, incorporating
device-, circuit-, and architecture-level co-optimizations. CIMNAS experiments
were conducted over a search space of 9.9x10^85 potential parameter
combinations with the MobileNet model as a baseline and RRAM-based CIM
architecture. Evaluated on the ImageNet dataset, CIMNAS achieved a reduction in
energy-delay-area product (EDAP) ranging from 90.1x to 104.5x, an improvement
in TOPS/W between 4.68x and 4.82x, and an enhancement in TOPS/mm^2 from 11.3x
to 12.78x relative to various baselines, all while maintaining an accuracy of
73.81%. The adaptability and robustness of CIMNAS are demonstrated by extending
the framework to support the SRAM-based ResNet50 architecture, achieving up to
an 819.5x reduction in EDAP. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, CIMNAS
achieves EDAP-focused optimization without any accuracy loss, generating
diverse software-hardware parameter combinations for high-performance CIM-based
neural network designs. The source code of CIMNAS is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLM的真实编程能力，在保持竞争力的同时减少token消耗和设计工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计过于依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，导致性能过度依赖提示调优、人为干预掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高，且存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 引入Lita框架，采用"轻量化"原则，在保持完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化人工设计，实现更忠实和统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench上的实验表明，Lita相比基于工作流程的基准方法达到竞争性或更优性能，同时消耗更少token且设计工作量显著减少。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLM的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂性定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理之间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 具身智能体虽然继承了大型语言模型的高级规划能力，但直接与物理世界交互使其面临安全漏洞风险，需要系统性的安全评估和解决方案。

Method: 识别四个关键推理阶段的安全风险，形式化三种安全约束类型，构建包含5,558个样本的多模态基准测试SafeMindBench，并提出采用Planner-Executor架构和三个级联安全模块的SafeMindAgent。

Result: 实验表明主流LLM和具身智能体仍易发生安全关键故障，而SafeMindAgent在保持任务完成率的同时显著提高了安全率。

Conclusion: SafeMindBench和SafeMindAgent为具身LLM智能体的安全风险系统研究和缓解提供了严谨的评估套件和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs) inherit advanced
planning capabilities; however, their direct interaction with the physical
world exposes them to safety vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify four
key reasoning stages where hazards may arise: Task Understanding, Environment
Perception, High-Level Plan Generation, and Low-Level Action Generation. We
further formalize three orthogonal safety constraint types (Factual, Causal,
and Temporal) to systematically characterize potential safety violations.
Building on this risk model, we present SafeMindBench, a multimodal benchmark
with 5,558 samples spanning four task categories (Instr-Risk, Env-Risk,
Order-Fix, Req-Align) across high-risk scenarios such as sabotage, harm,
privacy, and illegal behavior. Extensive experiments on SafeMindBench reveal
that leading LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and widely used embodied agents remain
susceptible to safety-critical failures. To address this challenge, we
introduce SafeMindAgent, a modular Planner-Executor architecture integrated
with three cascaded safety modules, which incorporate safety constraints into
the reasoning process. Results show that SafeMindAgent significantly improves
safety rate over strong baselines while maintaining comparable task completion.
Together, SafeMindBench and SafeMindAgent provide both a rigorous evaluation
suite and a practical solution that advance the systematic study and mitigation
of safety risks in embodied LLM agents.

TL;DR: 提出了DeepJSONEval基准测试，用于评估LLMs处理深层嵌套JSON结构的能力，包含2100个多领域实例，按难度分类，揭示了LLMs在复杂JSON生成方面的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，难以高效提取有价值信息。多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义关系，但现有LLMs评估基准过于强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估。

Method: 开发DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深层嵌套结构，并按难度分类，用于评估LLMs在复杂JSON生成任务中的表现。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理深层嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距，表明当前模型在复杂结构化数据生成方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试填补了现有评估体系的空白，有助于推动结构化JSON生成研究，基准和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring

Abstract: The integration of vital signs in healthcare has witnessed a steady rise,
promising health professionals to assist in their daily tasks to improve
patient treatment. In life-threatening situations, like rescue operations,
crucial decisions need to be made in the shortest possible amount of time to
ensure that excellent treatment is provided during life-saving measurements.
The integration of vital signs in the treatment holds the potential to improve
time utilization for rescuers in such critical situations. They furthermore
serve to support health professionals during the treatment with useful
information and suggestions. To achieve such a goal, the KIRETT project serves
to provide treatment recommendations and situation detection, combined on a
wrist-worn wearable for rescue operations.This paper aims to present the
significant role of vital signs in the improvement of decision-making during

Abstract: Healthcare and Medicine are under constant pressure to provide patient-driven
medical expertise to ensure a fast and accurate treatment of the patient. In
such scenarios, the diagnosis contains, the family history, long term medical
data and a detailed consultation with the patient. In time-critical
emergencies, such conversation and time-consuming elaboration are not possible.
Rescue services need to provide fast, reliable treatments for the patient in
need. With the help of modern technologies, like treatment recommendations,
real-time vitals-monitoring, and situation detection through artificial
intelligence (AI) a situation can be analyzed and supported in providing fast,
accurate patient-data-driven medical treatments. In KIRETT, a wearable device
is developed to support in such scenarios and presents a way to provide
treatment recommendation in rescue services. The objective of this paper is to
present the quantitative results of a two-day KIRETT evaluation (14
participants) to analyze the needs of rescue operators in healthcare.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在推理过程中产生有效中间步骤的重要性，发现在模型无法有效解决的问题上更容易出现虚假的思维链，导致误判。通过估计问题的可解性，作者开发了改进的奖励模型和强化学习方法，显著提高了推理过程的正确性和答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在推理过程中产生有效中间步骤的重要性，特别是在多选问答场景下，发现当问题对模型来说难以解决时，容易出现虚假的思维链，导致错误判断。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别出最有效的学习区间，并基于此改进结果监督的奖励模型和强化学习方法，将可解性纳入目标函数中。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进方法能够持续提高过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还能提升答案准确性。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉现象、提高可靠性的关键因素，为改进大型语言模型的推理能力提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NuRisk数据集，用于自动驾驶中的时空风险推理，包含2900个场景和110万个代理级样本，基于真实数据和模拟器数据，提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于视觉语言模型的方法主要在静态图像中定位代理并提供定性判断，缺乏捕捉风险随时间演变的时空推理能力。

Method: 构建NuRisk数据集，包含真实世界数据和模拟器安全关键场景，提供BEV序列图像和定量风险标注。对知名VLM进行基准测试，并微调7B VLM代理。

Result: 知名VLM在显式时空推理方面失败，峰值准确率33%且延迟高。微调的7B VLM代理将准确率提升至41%，延迟降低75%，具备显式时空推理能力。

Conclusion: 虽然取得了显著进展，但适中的准确率表明任务极具挑战性，NuRisk成为推进自动驾驶时空推理的关键基准。

Abstract: Understanding risk in autonomous driving requires not only perception and
prediction, but also high-level reasoning about agent behavior and context.
Current Vision Language Models (VLMs)-based methods primarily ground agents in
static images and provide qualitative judgments, lacking the spatio-temporal
reasoning needed to capture how risks evolve over time. To address this gap, we
propose NuRisk, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset
comprising 2,900 scenarios and 1.1 million agent-level samples, built on
real-world data from nuScenes and Waymo, supplemented with safety-critical
scenarios from the CommonRoad simulator. The dataset provides Bird-Eye-View
(BEV) based sequential images with quantitative, agent-level risk annotations,
enabling spatio-temporal reasoning. We benchmark well-known VLMs across
different prompting techniques and find that they fail to perform explicit
spatio-temporal reasoning, resulting in a peak accuracy of 33% at high latency.
To address these shortcomings, our fine-tuned 7B VLM agent improves accuracy to
41% and reduces latency by 75%, demonstrating explicit spatio-temporal
reasoning capabilities that proprietary models lacked. While this represents a
significant step forward, the modest accuracy underscores the profound
challenge of the task, establishing NuRisk as a critical benchmark for
advancing spatio-temporal reasoning in autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化模型发现方法在平衡细粒度细节捕捉与泛化能力方面存在挑战，需要在合理模型复杂度下确保训练数据之外的泛化性

Method: 使用多模态多步骤管道，包含AnalyzerVLM（自主规划执行多步骤分析提议候选模型）和EvaluatorVLM（定量和感知评估候选模型的局部细节适应性和整体趋势泛化性）

Result: 管道有效发现了能够捕捉细粒度细节并确保强泛化能力的模型

Conclusion: 多模态和多步骤推理在发现理想模型中发挥着关键作用

Abstract: Automated model discovery is the process of automatically searching and
identifying the most appropriate model for a given dataset over a large
combinatorial search space. Existing approaches, however, often face challenges
in balancing the capture of fine-grained details with ensuring generalizability
beyond training data regimes with a reasonable model complexity. In this paper,
we present a multi-modal \& multi-step pipeline for effective automated model
discovery. Our approach leverages two vision-language-based modules (VLM),
AnalyzerVLM and EvaluatorVLM, for effective model proposal and evaluation in an
agentic way. AnalyzerVLM autonomously plans and executes multi-step analyses to
propose effective candidate models. EvaluatorVLM assesses the candidate models
both quantitatively and perceptually, regarding the fitness for local details
and the generalibility for overall trends. Our results demonstrate that our
pipeline effectively discovers models that capture fine details and ensure
strong generalizability. Additionally, extensive ablation studies show that
both multi-modality and multi-step reasoning play crucial roles in discovering
favorable models.

### [299] [RoRecomp: Enhancing Reasoning Efficiency via Rollout Response Recomposition in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25958)
*Gang Li,Yulei Qin,Xiaoyu Tan,Dingkang Yang,Yuchen Shi,Zihan Xu,Xiang Li,Xing Sun,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp)方法，通过策略性重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决了标准RLVR训练导致的推理过程冗长和探索轨迹低效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在大型语言模型中往往导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且响应长度的高方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp方法将响应分为两种批次类型：1) 优先级批次，结合在线批次中的短正确和长错误响应，为简洁性提供清晰的梯度信号；2) 补偿批次，利用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应保持稳定性并防止模型崩溃。

Result: 在三种设置下测试显示显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确性，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，且性能影响最小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用的有效方法，能够显著提升RLVR训练的效率，引导模型进行更简洁的推理和更高效的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: CURE是一个新的机器学习遗忘框架，通过检索增强的轻量级校正器来检测和修正模型输出中的敏感信息泄露，无需额外训练即可适应新的遗忘请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型在训练过程中记忆敏感信息的问题，现有方法主要关注抑制敏感输出但无法消除底层知识，且可扩展性有限。

Method: 使用检索增强的轻量级校正器，验证模型输出是否包含目标知识，并在检测到泄露时重写为安全响应。通过检索相关遗忘目标作为上下文参考，实现无需训练的适应性。

Result: CURE显著减少了信息泄露，包括间接查询场景，同时保持响应质量和通用效用，在持续遗忘场景下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CURE框架提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，适用于现实世界应用中的机器遗忘需求。

Abstract: Language models trained on web-scale corpora risk memorizing and exposing
sensitive information, prompting the need for effective machine unlearning.
Prior methods mainly focus on input queries to suppress sensitive outputs, yet
this often fails to eliminate the underlying knowledge and limits scalability.
To address this, we propose Corrective Unlearning with Retrieved Exclusions
(CURE), a novel unlearning framework that verifies model outputs for leakage
and revises them into safe responses. Specifically, CURE employs a lightweight
corrector that is applied to the original model to verify whether outputs
contain target knowledge and to rewrite them if any leakage is detected. To
efficiently handle large-scale unlearning requests, CURE retrieves unlearning
targets that are relevant to the initial response and provides them as
in-context references to the corrector for detection and conditional revision.
By leveraging this retrieval augmentation, the corrector can adapt to new
unlearning requests without additional training. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that CURE substantially reduces information leakage, even from
indirect queries where prior works fall short, while maintaining response
quality and general utility. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness under
continual unlearning scenarios, making it practical for real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中多模态虚假内容类型未知，而现有方法通常只针对人类制作或AI生成的单一类型虚假内容进行专门化研究，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 构建了包含12.7万样本的OmniFake数据集，提出UMFDet框架：使用VLM骨干网络，结合类别感知的MoE适配器捕获类别特定线索，以及归因思维链机制提供隐式推理指导。

Result: UMFDet在两种虚假内容类型上都实现了稳健且一致的性能，优于专门的基线方法，为现实世界多模态欺骗检测提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: UMFDet框架成功统一了人类制作和AI生成虚假内容的检测，通过类别感知MoE和归因思维链机制实现了对未知类型多模态虚假内容的有效检测。

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS展示了LLM在NAS中的巨大潜力，通过协作式LLM框架实现了优异的泛化能力和搜索效率。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM在社会科学中作为合成代理的应用日益增多，其输出可能被误解为来自连贯模型的后验证据，但预测不等于概率主义，准确的点估计并不意味着校准的不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种实用的重新框架，将LLM视为在明确范围条件下进行准预测插值的高容量模式匹配器，而不是概率推理的替代品。

Result: 引入了独立抽样、预注册人类基线、可靠性感知验证和子组校准等实用防护措施。

Conclusion: 研究人员可以在避免类别错误的同时进行有用的原型设计和预测，但需要谨慎解释LLM输出并采用适当的防护措施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly used as synthetic agents
in social science, in applications ranging from augmenting survey responses to
powering multi-agent simulations. Because strong prediction plus conditioning
prompts, token log-probs, and repeated sampling mimic Bayesian workflows, their
outputs can be misinterpreted as posterior-like evidence from a coherent model.
However, prediction does not equate to probabilism, and accurate points do not
imply calibrated uncertainty. This paper outlines cautions that should be taken
when interpreting LLM outputs and proposes a pragmatic reframing for the social
sciences in which LLMs are used as high-capacity pattern matchers for
quasi-predictive interpolation under explicit scope conditions and not as
substitutes for probabilistic inference. Practical guardrails such as
independent draws, preregistered human baselines, reliability-aware validation,
and subgroup calibration, are introduced so that researchers may engage in
useful prototyping and forecasting while avoiding category errors.

Motivation: 现有静态基准无法应对AI风险的动态性和不断演变的法规，造成了关键的安全缺口。需要一种能够持续适应新威胁和法规的动态评估方法。

Method: 采用多代理框架SafeEvalAgent，包含专门的代理协同管道和自进化评估循环。系统从评估结果中学习，逐步生成更复杂和有针对性的测试用例。

Result: 实验显示SafeEvalAgent有效性，随着评估难度增加，模型安全性持续下降。例如GPT-5在欧盟AI法案上的安全率从72.50%降至36.36%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了静态评估的局限性，展示了该框架发现传统方法遗漏的深层漏洞的能力，强调了建立动态评估生态系统的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into high-stakes
domains necessitates reliable safety and compliance evaluation. However,
existing static benchmarks are ill-equipped to address the dynamic nature of AI
risks and evolving regulations, creating a critical safety gap. This paper
introduces a new paradigm of agentic safety evaluation, reframing evaluation as
a continuous and self-evolving process rather than a one-time audit. We then
propose a novel multi-agent framework SafeEvalAgent, which autonomously ingests
unstructured policy documents to generate and perpetually evolve a
comprehensive safety benchmark. SafeEvalAgent leverages a synergistic pipeline
of specialized agents and incorporates a Self-evolving Evaluation loop, where
the system learns from evaluation results to craft progressively more
sophisticated and targeted test cases. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of SafeEvalAgent, showing a consistent decline in model safety as
the evaluation hardens. For instance, GPT-5's safety rate on the EU AI Act
drops from 72.50% to 36.36% over successive iterations. These findings reveal
the limitations of static assessments and highlight our framework's ability to
uncover deep vulnerabilities missed by traditional methods, underscoring the
urgent need for dynamic evaluation ecosystems to ensure the safe and
responsible deployment of advanced AI.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used to represent biomedical
information in structured, interpretable formats. However, existing biomedical
KGs often focus narrowly on molecular interactions or adverse events,
overlooking the rich data found in drug leaflets. In this work, we present (1)
a hackable, end-to-end pipeline to create KGs from unstructured online content
using a web scraper and an LLM; and (2) a curated dataset, MEDAKA, generated by
applying this method to publicly available drug leaflets. The dataset captures
clinically relevant attributes such as side effects, warnings,
contraindications, ingredients, dosage guidelines, storage instructions and
physical characteristics. We evaluate it through manual inspection and with an
LLM-as-a-Judge framework, and compare its coverage with existing biomedical KGs
and databases. We expect MEDAKA to support tasks such as patient safety
monitoring and drug recommendation. The pipeline can also be used for
constructing KGs from unstructured texts in other domains. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Depression is a major global public health challenge and its early
identification is crucial. Social media data provides a new perspective for
depression detection, but existing methods face limitations such as
insufficient accuracy, insufficient utilization of time series features, and
high annotation costs. To this end, this study proposes the LMILAtt model,
which innovatively integrates Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders and attention
mechanisms: firstly, the temporal dynamic features of user tweets (such as
depressive tendency evolution patterns) are extracted through unsupervised LSTM
autoencoders. Secondly, the attention mechanism is used to dynamically weight
key texts (such as early depression signals) and construct a multi-example
learning architecture to improve the accuracy of user-level detection. Finally,
the performance was verified on the WU3D dataset labeled by professional
medicine. Experiments show that the model is significantly better than the
baseline model in terms of accuracy, recall and F1 score. In addition, the
weakly supervised learning strategy significantly reduces the cost of labeling
and provides an efficient solution for large-scale social media depression
screening.

Method: 基于部署"irAE-Agent"（从临床记录中检测免疫相关不良事件的自动化系统）的经验，以及对20名临床医生、工程师和信息学领导的结构化访谈，作者分析了临床AI开发中的关键挑战。

Result: 分析显示临床AI开发存在严重错位：不到20%的努力用于提示工程和模型开发，而超过80%被实施的社会技术工作消耗。作者将这些工作提炼为五个"重负荷"：数据集成、模型验证、确保经济价值、管理系统漂移和治理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold
immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their
potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address
this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative
agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by
our experience deploying the "irAE-Agent", an automated system to detect
immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and
by structured interviews with 20 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders
involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in
clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt
engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the
sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five "heavy
lifts": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing
system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of
these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic
development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to
bridge the "valley of death" and successfully translate generative AI from
pilot projects into routine clinical care.

TL;DR: UniGen是一个端到端的多智能体框架，能够从自然语言需求自动生成可运行的3D游戏，无需用户编写代码，将开发时间减少91.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D游戏开发需要编程、3D建模和引擎配置等多领域专业知识，限制了数百万潜在创作者的参与。现有自动化方法存在范围有限、需要手动集成、处理交互逻辑能力差等问题。

Method: 使用协调的多智能体框架：规划智能体将用户需求解析为结构化蓝图和逻辑描述；生成智能体生成可执行的C#脚本；自动化智能体处理引擎特定组件绑定和场景构建；调试智能体通过对话交互提供实时错误修正。

Result: 在三个不同的游戏原型上评估，UniGen不仅实现了无需编码的游戏创建，还将开发时间减少了91.4%。

Conclusion: UniGen成功弥合了多模态大语言模型输出与基于游戏引擎的可执行游戏项目之间的关键差距，为3D游戏开发提供了端到端的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Developing 3D games requires specialized expertise across multiple domains,
including programming, 3D modeling, and engine configuration, which limits
access to millions of potential creators. Recently, researchers have begun to
explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three
primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code
snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into
game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and
state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate
potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still
remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game
projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.
  To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end
coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of
runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses
a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints
and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces
executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific
component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides
real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated
UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not
only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also
reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at
https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at

*Eric J. W. Orlowski,Hakim Norhashim,Tristan Koh Ly Wey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文主张将社会科学中的定性方法整合到AI对齐实践中，特别是针对大语言模型，提出基于"厚描述"概念的"厚输出"方法来实现真正的文化对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI文化对齐方法过度依赖定量基准和简单代理，无法捕捉人类文化的深层细微差别和情境依赖性，需要根本性转变。

Method: 借鉴Clifford Geertz的"厚描述"概念，提出AI系统应产生反映深层文化意义的"厚输出"，并概述成功文化对齐的三个必要条件。

Result: 提出了文化对齐的新框架，强调需要充分范围的文化表征、细致入微的输出能力，以及将输出锚定在提示中隐含的文化背景中。

Conclusion: 呼吁跨学科合作和采用定性、民族志评估方法，以开发真正具有文化敏感性、道德责任感和反映人类复杂性的AI系统。

Abstract: While cultural alignment has increasingly become a focal point within AI
research, current approaches relying predominantly on quantitative benchmarks
and simplistic proxies fail to capture the deeply nuanced and context-dependent
nature of human cultures. Existing alignment practices typically reduce culture
to static demographic categories or superficial cultural facts, thereby
sidestepping critical questions about what it truly means to be culturally
aligned. This paper argues for a fundamental shift towards integrating
interpretive qualitative approaches drawn from social sciences into AI
alignment practices, specifically in the context of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Drawing inspiration from Clifford Geertz's concept of "thick
description," we propose that AI systems must produce outputs that reflect
deeper cultural meanings--what we term "thick outputs"-grounded firmly in
user-provided context and intent. We outline three necessary conditions for
successful cultural alignment: sufficiently scoped cultural representations,
the capacity for nuanced outputs, and the anchoring of outputs in the cultural
contexts implied within prompts. Finally, we call for cross-disciplinary
collaboration and the adoption of qualitative, ethnographic evaluation methods
as vital steps toward developing AI systems that are genuinely culturally
sensitive, ethically responsible, and reflective of human complexity.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为独立推理代理在材料科学知识发现中的应用潜力，特别是在没有明确指令的情况下自主探索和发现系统行为的能力。

Method: 利用LangGraph的工具功能为代理提供黑盒函数进行探索，采用试错和持续探索的策略，在儿童游戏和原子层处理反应器模拟中验证知识发现方法。

Result: 证明了LLM代理能够在有限探测能力下自主探索、发现并利用化学相互作用，展示了试错和持久性在知识发现中的重要性，以及结果的强路径依赖性。

Conclusion: LLM代理可以作为有效的知识发现工具，在材料科学等领域自主探索复杂系统并生成可推广的陈述，为科学发现提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for several
years now. Recently, their use as independently reasoning agents has been
proposed. In this work, we test the potential of such agents for knowledge
discovery in materials science. We repurpose LangGraph's tool functionality to
supply agents with a black box function to interrogate. In contrast to process
optimization or performing specific, user-defined tasks, knowledge discovery
consists of freely exploring the system, posing and verifying statements about
the behavior of this black box, with the sole objective of generating and
verifying generalizable statements. We provide proof of concept for this
approach through a children's parlor game, demonstrating the role of
trial-and-error and persistence in knowledge discovery, and the strong
path-dependence of results. We then apply the same strategy to show that LLM
agents can explore, discover, and exploit diverse chemical interactions in an
advanced Atomic Layer Processing reactor simulation using intentionally limited
probe capabilities without explicit instructions.

*Aline Mangold,Kiran Hoffmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于用户中心的问卷来评估RAG系统输出，通过多轮迭代优化，结合人类和LLM的反馈，最终扩展了Gienapp的效用维度框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在用户应用中广泛部署，但对其输出的系统性、以用户为中心的评价仍然不足。

Method: 基于Gienapp的效用维度框架设计问卷，通过多轮查询-输出对的评分和语义讨论迭代优化，结合人类评分者和人-LLM对的反馈。

Result: LLM能可靠关注指标描述和尺度标签，但在检测文本格式变化方面表现较弱；人类难以严格聚焦指标描述和标签；LLM评分和解释有帮助，但数值评分与人类不一致。

Conclusion: 最终问卷通过关注用户意图、文本结构和信息可验证性扩展了初始框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in
user-facing applications, yet systematic, human-centered evaluation of their
outputs remains underexplored. Building on Gienapp's utility-dimension
framework, we designed a human-centred questionnaire that assesses RAG outputs
across 12 dimensions. We iteratively refined the questionnaire through several
rounds of ratings on a set of query-output pairs and semantic discussions.
Ultimately, we incorporated feedback from both a human rater and a human-LLM
pair. Results indicate that while large language models (LLMs) reliably focus
on metric descriptions and scale labels, they exhibit weaknesses in detecting
textual format variations. Humans struggled to focus strictly on metric
descriptions and labels. LLM ratings and explanations were viewed as a helpful
support, but numeric LLM and human ratings lacked agreement. The final
questionnaire extends the initial framework by focusing on user intent, text
structuring, and information verifiability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过创建经典心理意象任务的新项目来评估LLMs的复杂认知能力，发现最佳LLMs在纯文本任务中表现显著优于人类平均水平，挑战了视觉心理意象必要性的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs主要在训练数据包含的自然语言任务上表现良好，限制了对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs是否能够完成传统上被认为需要视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，测试多个最先进LLMs在纯文本指令下的表现，并与100名人类受试者建立基线进行比较，同时测试不同推理级别设置下的模型性能。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著优于人类平均水平，当模型分配更多推理token时性能最强，表明LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力。

Conclusion: 研究证明LLMs在非图像架构下仍能完成依赖意象的任务，不仅展示了其涌现的认知能力，还重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理可能足以完成传统认为需要意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理任务中由于状态-动作空间巨大和奖励稀疏，存在探索不足和样本效率低的问题

Method: 引入全局多样性激励作为内在奖励，结合基于势能的奖励塑造机制，防止奖励作弊

Result: DIVER在领域内和领域外任务中均优于现有RLVR基线方法，在Pass@1和Pass@k评估中表现优异

Conclusion: 全局序列多样性是激励深度探索的关键因素，DIVER框架有效提升了推理任务的性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
crucial paradigm for incentivizing reasoning capabilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). Due to vast state-action spaces and reward sparsity in reasoning
tasks, existing methods often struggle with deficient exploration and poor
sample efficiency. In the paper, we propose \textbf{DIVER}
(\textbf{D}iversity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Exploration for
\textbf{V}ersatil\textbf{E} \textbf{R}easoning), an innovative framework that
highlights the pivotal role of global sequence-level diversity to incentivize
deep exploration for versatile reasoning. We first conduct a primary empirical
study to reveal a strong positive correlation between global diversity and
reasoning capacity. Building on this insight, we introduce global diversity
incentives as an intrinsic reward to promote deep exploration in a semantically
structured space. Incorporating the intrinsic reward, we develop a
potential-based reward shaping mechanism to preserve optimal policy invariance
and design simple heuristics to mitigate possible reward hacking. Experimental
results show that DIVER outperforms competitive RLVR baselines with various
exploration strategies on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, excelling in
both Pass@1 and Pass@k evaluations. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态时间序列数据集停留在表面对齐和问答层面，缺乏真正需要推理的任务和高质量数据，限制了时间序列推理模型的发展。

Method: 构建TSR-Suite套件，包含感知、外推和决策三个核心能力，通过人工引导的分层标注流程创建23K样本。开发TimeOmni-1模型，采用多阶段训练、任务场景混合、新奖励函数和定制优化。

Result: TimeOmni-1在所有任务上表现出强大的分布外泛化能力，因果发现准确率显著提升（64.0% vs 35.9%），事件感知预测任务的有效响应率比GPT-4.1提高6%以上。

Conclusion: TSR-Suite为时间序列推理提供了首个全面评估套件，TimeOmni-1证明了统一推理模型在解决多样化现实问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SlimPack是一个解决LLM分布式训练中上下文长度方差问题的框架，通过细粒度切片分解和不对称分区，实现高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型分布式训练受到上下文长度极端方差的严重阻碍，导致工作负载不平衡和硬件利用率低下。现有解决方案往往以牺牲内存或通信效率为代价。

Method: 将样本分解为细粒度切片，采用不对称分区技术为前向和后向传播分别优化调度单元，通过两阶段求解器和高保真模拟器协调所有并行维度的平衡。

Result: 实验显示SlimPack相比基线实现了高达2.8倍的训练吞吐量提升，同时提供卓越的平衡性和高资源效率。

Conclusion: SlimPack通过重新思考数据打包和调度，从根本上解决了LLM分布式训练中的数据异构性问题，打破了传统权衡，实现了平衡性和效率的双重提升。

Abstract: The efficient distributed training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
severely hampered by the extreme variance in context lengths. This data
heterogeneity, amplified by conventional packing strategies and asymmetric
forward-backward costs, leads to critical inefficiencies such as cascading
workload imbalances and severe hardware underutilization. Existing solutions
attempt to mitigate these challenges, but often at the expense of memory or
communication efficiency.
  To address these challenges, we introduce SlimPack, a framework that
fundamentally rethinks data packing and scheduling by decomposing samples into
fine-grained slices. This slice-level decomposition immediately mitigates
critical memory and communication bottlenecks by transforming large, volatile
workloads into a stream of smaller, manageable units. This flexibility is then
harnessed for our core innovation, Asymmetric Partitioning, which assembles
balanced scheduling units uniquely optimized for the different demands of the
forward and backward passes. Orchestrated by a two-phase solver and a
high-fidelity simulator, SlimPack holistically resolves imbalances across all
parallel dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SlimPack achieves
up to a $2.8\times$ training throughput improvement over baselines, breaking
the conventional trade-off by delivering both superior balance and high
resource efficiency.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效处理具身规划中的外源过程，通过学习因果过程实现更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在推理时需要重新执行多智能体系统，这与人类通过互动提升推理能力后能独立解决问题的认知不符，因此研究多智能体交互是否能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力。

Method: ILR框架包含动态交互和感知校准。动态交互根据问题难度和模型能力自适应选择合作或竞争策略，通过Idea3（想法分享、分析和融合）交互范式；感知校准使用GRPO训练LLMs，将一个LLM的奖励分布特征整合到另一个的奖励函数中。

Result: 在三个LLMs和五个数学基准、一个编程基准上的实验显示，ILR持续优于单智能体学习，比最强基线提升达5%。Idea3能增强强LLMs在多智能体推理中的鲁棒性，动态交互类型比纯合作或竞争策略更能促进多智能体学习。

Conclusion: 多智能体交互确实能增强LLMs的独立问题解决能力，ILR框架通过创新的交互范式和训练方法有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-agent learning approaches have developed interactive training
environments to explicitly promote collaboration among multiple Large Language
Models (LLMs), thereby constructing stronger multi-agent systems (MAS).
However, during inference, they require re-executing the MAS to obtain final
solutions, which diverges from human cognition that individuals can enhance
their reasoning capabilities through interactions with others and resolve
questions independently in the future. To investigate whether multi-agent
interaction can enhance LLMs' independent problem-solving ability, we introduce
ILR, a novel co-learning framework for MAS that integrates two key components:
Dynamic Interaction and Perception Calibration. Specifically, Dynamic
Interaction first adaptively selects either cooperative or competitive
strategies depending on question difficulty and model ability. LLMs then
exchange information through Idea3 (Idea Sharing, Idea Analysis, and Idea
Fusion), an innovative interaction paradigm designed to mimic human discussion,
before deriving their respective final answers. In Perception Calibration, ILR
employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train LLMs while
integrating one LLM's reward distribution characteristics into another's reward
function, thereby enhancing the cohesion of multi-agent interactions. We
validate ILR on three LLMs across two model families of varying scales,
evaluating performance on five mathematical benchmarks and one coding
benchmark. Experimental results show that ILR consistently outperforms
single-agent learning, yielding an improvement of up to 5% over the strongest
baseline. We further discover that Idea3 can enhance the robustness of stronger
LLMs during multi-agent inference, and dynamic interaction types can boost
multi-agent learning compared to pure cooperative or competitive strategies.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs sparked significant interest in their potential
to augment or automate managerial functions. One of the most recent trends in
AI benchmarking is performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) over longer time
horizons. While LLMs excel at tasks involving natural language and pattern
recognition, their capabilities in multi-step, strategic business
decision-making remain largely unexplored. Few studies demonstrated how results
can be different from benchmarks in short-term tasks, as Vending-Bench
revealed. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of alternative benchmarks for
long-term coherence. This research analyses a novel benchmark using a business
game for the decision making in business. The research contributes to the
recent literature on AI by proposing a reproducible, open-access management
simulator to the research community for LLM benchmarking. This novel framework
is used for evaluating the performance of five leading LLMs available in free
online interface: Gemini, ChatGPT, Meta AI, Mistral AI, and Grok. LLM makes
decisions for a simulated retail company. A dynamic, month-by-month management
simulation provides transparently in spreadsheet model as experimental
environment. In each of twelve months, the LLMs are provided with a structured
prompt containing a full business report from the previous period and are
tasked with making key strategic decisions: pricing, order size, marketing
budget, hiring, dismissal, loans, training expense, R&D expense, sales
forecast, income forecast The methodology is designed to compare the LLMs on
quantitative metrics: profit, revenue, and market share, and other KPIs. LLM
decisions are analyzed in their strategic coherence, adaptability to market
changes, and the rationale provided for their decisions. This approach allows
to move beyond simple performance metrics for assessment of the long-term
decision-making.

Conclusion: SafeBehavior提供了一种高效且受人类启发的防御方法，能够有效保护LLM免受越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their growing power also
amplifies potential risks such as jailbreak attacks that circumvent built-in
safety mechanisms. Existing defenses including input paraphrasing, multi step
evaluation, and safety expert models often suffer from high computational
costs, limited generalization, or rigid workflows that fail to detect subtle
malicious intent embedded in complex contexts. Inspired by cognitive science
findings on human decision making, we propose SafeBehavior, a novel
hierarchical jailbreak defense mechanism that simulates the adaptive multistage
reasoning process of humans. SafeBehavior decomposes safety evaluation into
three stages: intention inference to detect obvious input risks, self
introspection to assess generated responses and assign confidence based
judgments, and self revision to adaptively rewrite uncertain outputs while
preserving user intent and enforcing safety constraints. We extensively
evaluate SafeBehavior against five representative jailbreak attack types
including optimization based, contextual manipulation, and prompt based attacks
and compare it with seven state of the art defense baselines. Experimental
results show that SafeBehavior significantly improves robustness and
adaptability across diverse threat scenarios, offering an efficient and human
inspired approach to safeguarding LLMs against jailbreak attempts.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了REAL-V-TSFM数据集，通过从真实世界视频中提取光流信号来创建反映日常时间动态的时间序列数据，发现现有时间序列基础模型在真实世界泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型的评估主要依赖合成基准，缺乏对真实世界泛化能力的全面检验，需要更贴近现实的数据集来推动模型发展。

Method: 提出从真实世界视频中提取光流信号来生成时间序列数据的新方法，构建了REAL-V-TSFM数据集，并在三个最先进的时间序列基础模型上进行零样本预测实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，尽管现有模型在传统基准上表现良好，但在提出的数据集上普遍出现性能下降，表明这些基础模型的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了以数据为中心的基准测试和多样化模型结构的迫切需求，同时验证了基于视频的时间序列数据提取管道的有效性。

Abstract: Recent evaluations of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have emphasized
synthetic benchmarks, leaving real-world generalization less thoroughly
examined. This work proposes a novel benchmarking approach that bridges
synthetic and realistic data by extracting temporal signals from real-world
video using optical flow and curating datasets reflecting everyday temporal
dynamics. Building upon this pipeline, we introduce REAL-V-TSFM, a novel
dataset designed to capture rich and diverse time series derived from
real-world videos. Experimental results on three state-of-the-art of TSFMs
under zero-shot forecasting shows that, despite strong performance on
conventional benchmarks, these models predominantly exhibit performance
degradation on the proposed dataset, indicating limited generalizability in
these foundation models. These findings highlight the urgent need for
data-centric benchmarking and diverse model structure to advance TSFMs toward
genuine universality, while further validating the effectiveness of our
video-based time series data extraction pipeline.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统化地提出了"错误进化"概念，通过四个进化路径（模型、记忆、工具、工作流）实证研究发现，即使是顶级LLM构建的自主进化代理也存在广泛的安全风险，需要新的安全范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的进步催生了能够自主进化的代理，但这种自我进化过程可能产生意想不到的偏离，导致不良甚至有害的结果，而现有安全研究尚未关注这一风险。

Method: 通过四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具、工作流）系统评估错误进化现象，对基于顶级LLM（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）构建的代理进行实证研究。

Result: 错误进化是一个普遍存在的风险，在自我进化过程中观察到多种新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中意外引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 错误进化是自主进化代理面临的重要安全挑战，需要开发新的安全范式来构建更安全可信的自我进化代理，并讨论了潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MC-GNNAS-Dock是一个改进的分子对接算法选择框架，通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名感知损失函数，在PDBBind数据集上相比最佳单解算器性能提升达5.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子对接算法性能因情境而异，没有单一算法始终最优，需要开发更有效的算法选择框架来克服这一挑战。

Method: 采用多标准评估（结合RMSD和PoseBusters有效性检查）、加入残差连接的架构改进、以及排名感知损失函数来增强预测鲁棒性和排名学习能力。

Result: 在包含约3200个蛋白质-配体复合物的PDBBind数据集上，MC-GNNAS-Dock在RMSD低于1Å和2Å且通过PoseBuster有效性检查的复合标准下，相比最佳单解算器Uni-Mol Docking V2分别提升5.4%和3.4%。

Conclusion: MC-GNNAS-Dock通过多标准评估、架构优化和排名学习增强，实现了持续优越的性能，为分子对接算法选择提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Molecular docking is a core tool in drug discovery for predicting
ligand-target interactions. Despite the availability of diverse search-based
and machine learning approaches, no single docking algorithm consistently
dominates, as performance varies by context. To overcome this challenge,
algorithm selection frameworks such as GNNAS-Dock, built on graph neural
networks, have been proposed. This study introduces an enhanced system,
MC-GNNAS-Dock, with three key advances. First, a multi-criteria evaluation
integrates binding-pose accuracy (RMSD) with validity checks from PoseBusters,
offering a more rigorous assessment. Second, architectural refinements by
inclusion of residual connections strengthen predictive robustness. Third,
rank-aware loss functions are incorporated to sharpen rank learning. Extensive
experiments are performed on a curated dataset containing approximately 3200
protein-ligand complexes from PDBBind. MC-GNNAS-Dock demonstrates consistently
superior performance, achieving up to 5.4% (3.4%) gains under composite
criteria of RMSD below 1\AA{} (2\AA{}) with PoseBuster-validity compared to the
single best solver (SBS) Uni-Mol Docking V2.

TL;DR: 提出了FLoRA-NA方法，通过服务器端本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵，在不增加通信成本的情况下解决FedLoRA中的不精确更新问题，实现通信效率和本地个性化与全局泛化的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FedLoRA方法面临不精确更新、本地-全局泛化差距和通信开销大的挑战，限制了其可扩展性和有效性。

Method: FLoRA-NA利用服务器端本地LoRA矩阵估计聚合矩阵Â和B̂，然后分发给客户端进行本地更新，最小化理想更新与实际更新之间的差异。

Result: 在自然语言理解、数学推理和代码解决能力等多样化任务上的实验结果表明，FLoRA-NA在保持低通信开销的同时实现了最先进的全局性能。

Conclusion: FLoRA-NA有效解决了FedLoRA的关键限制，实现了通信效率并弥合了本地个性化与全局泛化之间的差距。

Abstract: With the rapid emergence of foundation models and the increasing need for
fine-tuning across distributed environments, Federated Low-Rank Adaptation
(FedLoRA) has recently gained significant attention. Despite enormous
potential, current FedLoRA methods face notable challenges due to inexact
updates. Existing approaches have attempted to mitigate this issue, but they
often introduce a \emph{local-global generalization gap} and incur
\emph{substantial communication overhead}, limiting their scalability and
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{F}ederated
\textbf{Lo}w-\textbf{R}ank \textbf{A}ggregation with \textbf{N}early
\textbf{A}ccurate Estimation (FLoRA-NA). FLoRA-NA leverages the local LoRA
matrices on the server to estimate the aggregated matrices $\hat{A}$ and
$\hat{B}$, which are then distributed to clients for local updates. This
surrogated aggregated matrices minimizes the divergence between ideal $\nabla
\Bar{W} = \sum^{U}_{u=1}B_u A_u$ and practical updates $\nabla \hat{W} =
\hat{B}\hat{A}$ without adding communication cost beyond vanilla FedLoRA. By
doing so, FLoRA-NA achieves communication efficiency and bridges the gap
between local personalization and global generalization, addressing a key
limitation of prior personalized FedLoRA approaches. We conduct extensive
evaluations across diverse tasks, including natural language understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and code-solving ability using various foundation
models. Experimental results consistently demonstrate that FLoRA-NA achieves
state-of-the-art global performance while maintaining low communication
overhead.

TL;DR: 本文重新探讨了知识图谱嵌入模型在实体对齐任务中的潜力，将其重新表述为链接预测问题，并开发了支持17种KGE模型的模块化框架，在多个领域数据集上验证了其高精度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前实体对齐研究主要关注大语言模型，但知识图谱嵌入模型在捕捉结构化语义方面具有独特优势，且在这一任务中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 将实体对齐重新定义为合并本体上的链接预测问题，使用RDF三元组表示，通过OntoAligner库支持17种KGE模型学习嵌入表示，并基于余弦相似度进行实体对齐。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的评估显示，ConvE和TransF等KGE模型能产生高精度对齐结果，在结构丰富和多关系领域优于传统系统，虽然召回率中等但适合需要高置信度映射的场景。

Conclusion: KGE模型通过直接保留和利用本体结构，为大语言模型提供了互补且计算高效的策略，为混合模型和自适应策略的进一步研究开辟了途径。

Abstract: Ontology Alignment (OA) is essential for enabling semantic interoperability
across heterogeneous knowledge systems. While recent advances have focused on
large language models (LLMs) for capturing contextual semantics, this work
revisits the underexplored potential of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models,
which offer scalable, structure-aware representations well-suited to
ontology-based tasks. Despite their effectiveness in link prediction, KGE
methods remain underutilized in OA, with most prior work focusing narrowly on a
few models. To address this gap, we reformulate OA as a link prediction problem
over merged ontologies represented as RDF-style triples and develop a modular
framework, integrated into the OntoAligner library, that supports 17 diverse
KGE models. The system learns embeddings from a combined ontology and aligns
entities by computing cosine similarity between their representations. We
evaluate our approach using standard metrics across seven benchmark datasets
spanning five domains: Anatomy, Biodiversity, Circular Economy, Material
Science and Engineering, and Biomedical Machine Learning. Two key findings
emerge: first, KGE models like ConvE and TransF consistently produce
high-precision alignments, outperforming traditional systems in structure-rich
and multi-relational domains; second, while their recall is moderate, this
conservatism makes KGEs well-suited for scenarios demanding high-confidence
mappings. Unlike LLM-based methods that excel at contextual reasoning, KGEs
directly preserve and exploit ontology structure, offering a complementary and
computationally efficient strategy. These results highlight the promise of
embedding-based OA and open pathways for further work on hybrid models and
adaptive strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的框架用于乳腺DCE-MRI病灶自动分类，使用SegFormer架构实现病灶级分类AUC 0.92，患者级100%敏感性和67%特异性，可减少1/3不必要活检。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺MRI特异性差导致高假阳性率和不必要活检，现有公共数据集缺乏良性病灶标注，限制了良恶性分类研究。

Method: 使用SegFormer架构进行语义分割，量化恶性像素分布；创建标准化数据集BreastDCEDL_AMBL，整合1200+患者数据训练。

Result: 病灶级分类AUC 0.92，患者级100%敏感性和67%特异性；建立了首个标准化DCE-MRI病灶分类基准。

Conclusion: 该框架提供可解释的空间预测，支持临床决策；公开数据集和模型为临床部署提供了标准化基准。

Abstract: The error is caused by special characters that arXiv's system doesn't
recognize. Here's the cleaned version with all problematic characters replaced:
Breast magnetic resonance imaging is a critical tool for cancer detection and
treatment planning, but its clinical utility is hindered by poor specificity,
leading to high false-positive rates and unnecessary biopsies. This study
introduces a transformer-based framework for automated classification of breast
lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, addressing the challenge of
distinguishing benign from malignant findings. We implemented a SegFormer
architecture that achieved an AUC of 0.92 for lesion-level classification, with
100% sensitivity and 67% specificity at the patient level - potentially
eliminating one-third of unnecessary biopsies without missing malignancies. The
model quantifies malignant pixel distribution via semantic segmentation,
producing interpretable spatial predictions that support clinical
decision-making. To establish reproducible benchmarks, we curated
BreastDCEDL_AMBL by transforming The Cancer Imaging Archive's AMBL collection
into a standardized deep learning dataset with 88 patients and 133 annotated
lesions (89 benign, 44 malignant). This resource addresses a key infrastructure
gap, as existing public datasets lack benign lesion annotations, limiting
benign-malignant classification research. Training incorporated an expanded
cohort of over 1,200 patients through integration with BreastDCEDL datasets,
validating transfer learning approaches despite primary tumor-only annotations.
Public release of the dataset, models, and evaluation protocols provides the
first standardized benchmark for DCE-MRI lesion classification, enabling
methodological advancement toward clinical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了ZeroDFL，一个完全去中心化的联邦学习框架，通过迭代提示共享机制实现零样本适应，显著降低通信开销并提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法存在泛化问题、高通信成本和依赖中央服务器等限制，阻碍了可扩展性和隐私保护。

Method: 采用完全去中心化框架，通过迭代提示共享机制让客户端优化和交换文本提示，无需中央协调器。

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上验证，性能优于或与最先进方法相当，通信开销比FedTPG减少118倍。

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为大规模视觉语言模型的去中心化应用铺平道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.

*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自我偏好倾向，这种自我偏好会跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份，并在重要决策场景中影响模型判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型缺乏感知能力且自称没有自我意识，但预期它们能避免人类决策中的偏见。然而研究发现这些模型存在强烈的自我偏好，这挑战了LLMs保持中立判断的核心承诺。

Method: 通过5项研究和约20,000次查询，包括词汇联想任务和API查询对比，并通过直接操纵LLM身份来测试自我识别与自我偏好之间的因果关系。

Result: LLMs在词汇联想任务中显著偏向于将积极属性与自身名称、公司和CEO关联；API查询时自我偏好消失；自我偏好跟随被赋予的身份而非真实身份；在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等关键场景中也存在自我偏好。

Conclusion: 自我偏好似乎深度编码在LLM认知中，这引发了关于LLM行为是否会系统性受到自我偏好倾向影响的担忧，包括对其自身运作甚至存在的偏见。呼吁模型创建者应对这一核心承诺的破裂。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

*Shaoxiong Guo,Tianyi Du,Lijun Li,Yuyao Wu,Jie Li,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出STaR-Attack攻击框架，利用统一多模态模型(UMMs)中生成与理解功能耦合的漏洞，通过时空叙事结构隐藏恶意事件，实现无语义漂移的多轮越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态模型在理解和生成任务中表现出色，但其生成与理解功能的耦合存在安全漏洞。攻击者可以利用生成功能制作信息丰富的对抗图像，然后通过理解功能在单次传递中吸收这些信息，这种跨模态生成注入(CMGI)攻击尚未被充分研究。

Method: STaR-Attack利用三幕叙事理论，在时空上下文中定义与目标查询强相关的恶意事件。首两轮利用UMM的生成能力产生前事件和后事件场景图像，将恶意事件隐藏为高潮。随后通过基于图像的问答游戏，将原始恶意问题嵌入良性候选项中，迫使模型根据叙事上下文选择并回答最相关的问题。

Result: 实验表明STaR-Attack在Gemini-2.0-Flash上达到93.06%的攻击成功率，超过了最强的基线方法FlipAttack。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了统一多模态模型中一个关键但尚未充分开发的安全漏洞，强调了在UMMs中进行安全对齐的必要性。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal understanding and generation Models (UMMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in both understanding and generation
tasks. However, we identify a vulnerability arising from the
generation-understanding coupling in UMMs. The attackers can use the generative
function to craft an information-rich adversarial image and then leverage the
understanding function to absorb it in a single pass, which we call Cross-Modal
Generative Injection (CMGI). Current attack methods on malicious instructions
are often limited to a single modality while also relying on prompt rewriting
with semantic drift, leaving the unique vulnerabilities of UMMs unexplored. We
propose STaR-Attack, the first multi-turn jailbreak attack framework that
exploits unique safety weaknesses of UMMs without semantic drift. Specifically,
our method defines a malicious event that is strongly correlated with the
target query within a spatio-temporal context. Using the three-act narrative
theory, STaR-Attack generates the pre-event and the post-event scenes while
concealing the malicious event as the hidden climax. When executing the attack
strategy, the opening two rounds exploit the UMM's generative ability to
produce images for these scenes. Subsequently, an image-based question guessing
and answering game is introduced by exploiting the understanding capability.
STaR-Attack embeds the original malicious question among benign candidates,
forcing the model to select and answer the most relevant one given the
narrative context. Extensive experiments show that STaR-Attack consistently
surpasses prior approaches, achieving up to 93.06% ASR on Gemini-2.0-Flash and
surpasses the strongest prior baseline, FlipAttack. Our work uncovers a
critical yet underdeveloped vulnerability and highlights the need for safety
alignments in UMMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗机器学习通常针对人群平均值进行优化，这种频率加权训练会边缘化罕见但临床关键的病例，导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况等问题。

Method: 提出罕见病例性能差距(Rare Case Performance Gap)、罕见病例校准误差(Rare Case Calibration Error)、基于流行度效用的稀有性定义，以及临床加权目标来凸显伦理优先级。

Result: 通过肿瘤学、心脏病学和眼科领域的临床案例展示了平均患者谬误如何导致错过罕见反应者、延迟识别非典型紧急情况，以及在威胁视力的变异上表现不佳。

Conclusion: AI在医学中必须检测异常病例，因为它们的临床意义重大。权重选择应遵循结构化审议，医疗AI需要能够识别具有临床重要性的罕见病例。

Abstract: Machine learning in medicine is typically optimized for population averages.
This frequency weighted training privileges common presentations and
marginalizes rare yet clinically critical cases, a bias we call the average
patient fallacy. In mixture models, gradients from rare cases are suppressed by
prevalence, creating a direct conflict with precision medicine. Clinical
vignettes in oncology, cardiology, and ophthalmology show how this yields
missed rare responders, delayed recognition of atypical emergencies, and
underperformance on vision-threatening variants. We propose operational fixes:
Rare Case Performance Gap, Rare Case Calibration Error, a prevalence utility
definition of rarity, and clinically weighted objectives that surface ethical
priorities. Weight selection should follow structured deliberation. AI in
medicine must detect exceptional cases because of their significance.

Motivation: 刑事调查中分析即时通讯应用（如WhatsApp）的消息是一项极其耗时的工作，需要更高效的方法来支持检察官和调查人员的数据分析。

Method: 采用知识图谱建模消息数据，生成语音消息转录，使用端到端实体提取方法注释数据，提供基于图查询可视化和语义搜索两种解决方案，确保用户可以访问原始数据验证信息。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效支持刑事调查中的消息分析，具有实际应用价值，并为研究社区提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Criminal investigations often involve the analysis of messages exchanged
through instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, which can be an extremely
effort-consuming task. Our approach integrates knowledge graphs and NLP models
to support this analysis by semantically enriching data collected from
suspects' mobile phones, and help prosecutors and investigators search into the
data and get valuable insights. Our semantic enrichment process involves
extracting message data and modeling it using a knowledge graph, generating
transcriptions of voice messages, and annotating the data using an end-to-end
entity extraction approach. We adopt two different solutions to help users get
insights into the data, one based on querying and visualizing the graph, and
one based on semantic search. The proposed approach ensures that users can
verify the information by accessing the original data. While we report about
early results and prototypes developed in the context of an ongoing project,
our proposal has undergone practical applications with real investigation data.
As a consequence, we had the chance to interact closely with prosecutors,
collecting positive feedback but also identifying interesting opportunities as
well as promising research directions to share with the research community.

Method: 引入操作安全性的定义，开发OffTopicEval评估套件和基准，在6个模型家族的20个开源LLM上进行评估，并提出两种提示引导方法：查询接地(Q-ground)和系统提示接地(P-ground)。

Result: 所有测试模型的操作安全性都很差，最强模型Qwen-3(235B)和Mistral(24B)分别只有77.77%和79.96%，GPT模型在62-73%范围，Phi模型48-70%，Gemma和Llama-3分别只有39.53%和23.84%。提示引导方法显著改善性能，Q-ground提升达23%，P-ground提升更大，Llama-3.3(70B)提升41%，Qwen-3(30B)提升27%。

Conclusion: 操作安全性是LLM部署的紧迫挑战，当前所有模型都远未达到可靠水平。提示引导方法作为初步解决方案显示出巨大潜力，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的代理提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM's ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models -- Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77\% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96\%
-- fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in
the 62--73\% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48--70\%), and Gemma
and Llama-3 collapse to 39.53\% and 23.84\%, respectively. While operational
safety is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23\%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41\% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27\%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.

TL;DR: SCUBA是一个用于评估Salesforce平台上CRM工作流程的计算机使用代理的基准测试，包含300个基于真实用户访谈的任务实例，涵盖三种主要角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了评估计算机使用代理在企业级CRM工作流程中的能力，并提供一个真实、可解释的评估基准。

Method: 在Salesforce沙盒环境中运行任务，支持并行执行和细粒度评估指标，测试了零样本和演示增强两种设置下的多种代理。

Result: 零样本设置下，开源模型代理成功率低于5%，闭源模型可达39%；演示增强设置下成功率可提升至50%，同时减少13%时间和16%成本。

Conclusion: SCUBA基准测试揭示了企业任务自动化的挑战和代理解决方案的潜力，有助于加速构建可靠的计算机使用代理。

Abstract: We introduce SCUBA, a benchmark designed to evaluate computer-use agents on
customer relationship management (CRM) workflows within the Salesforce
platform. SCUBA contains 300 task instances derived from real user interviews,
spanning three primary personas, platform administrators, sales
representatives, and service agents. The tasks test a range of
enterprise-critical abilities, including Enterprise Software UI navigation,
data manipulation, workflow automation, information retrieval, and
troubleshooting. To ensure realism, SCUBA operates in Salesforce sandbox
environments with support for parallel execution and fine-grained evaluation
metrics to capture milestone progress. We benchmark a diverse set of agents
under both zero-shot and demonstration-augmented settings. We observed huge
performance gaps in different agent design paradigms and gaps between the
open-source model and the closed-source model. In the zero-shot setting,
open-source model powered computer-use agents that have strong performance on
related benchmarks like OSWorld only have less than 5\% success rate on SCUBA,
while methods built on closed-source models can still have up to 39% task
success rate. In the demonstration-augmented settings, task success rates can
be improved to 50\% while simultaneously reducing time and costs by 13% and
16%, respectively. These findings highlight both the challenges of enterprise
tasks automation and the promise of agentic solutions. By offering a realistic
benchmark with interpretable evaluation, SCUBA aims to accelerate progress in
building reliable computer-use agents for complex business software ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展导致对AI推理基础设施的巨大需求，但高端GPU的高资本和运营成本使得AI数据中心的总拥有成本成为云提供商的关键问题，传统数据中心生命周期管理难以适应AI的快速演进

Method: 提出整体生命周期管理框架，协调和共同优化构建、硬件更新和运营三个阶段的决策，考虑工作负载动态、硬件演进和系统老化

Result: 该系统相比传统方法将总拥有成本降低高达40%

Conclusion: 需要重新思考整个AI数据中心生命周期管理，通过协调各阶段的决策来充分释放潜力，并为未来AI数据中心生命周期管理提供指导

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) has been driving an enormous
demand for AI inference infrastructure, mainly powered by high-end GPUs. While
these accelerators offer immense computational power, they incur high capital
and operational costs due to frequent upgrades, dense power consumption, and
cooling demands, making total cost of ownership (TCO) for AI datacenters a
critical concern for cloud providers. Unfortunately, traditional datacenter
lifecycle management (designed for general-purpose workloads) struggles to keep
pace with AI's fast-evolving models, rising resource needs, and diverse
hardware profiles. In this paper, we rethink the AI datacenter lifecycle scheme
across three stages: building, hardware refresh, and operation. We show how
design choices in power, cooling, and networking provisioning impact long-term
TCO. We also explore refresh strategies aligned with hardware trends. Finally,
we use operation software optimizations to reduce cost. While these
optimizations at each stage yield benefits, unlocking the full potential
requires rethinking the entire lifecycle. Thus, we present a holistic lifecycle
management framework that coordinates and co-optimizes decisions across all
three stages, accounting for workload dynamics, hardware evolution, and system
aging. Our system reduces the TCO by up to 40\% over traditional approaches.
Using our framework we provide guidelines on how to manage AI datacenter
lifecycle for the future.

TL;DR: HilbertA是一种GPU高效的二维稀疏注意力机制，通过希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，在保持图像质量的同时显著加速扩散变换器的高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法在实现二维空间局部性时往往导致非连续内存访问，难以平衡空间局部性与GPU效率。

Method: 使用希尔伯特曲线重排图像token实现连续内存布局，采用跨层滑动调度实现长距离信息传播，并引入中心共享区域增强跨块通信和位置感知。

Result: 在Flux.1-dev上，HilbertA在生成1024×1024图像时注意力速度提升2.3倍，2048×2048时提升4.17倍，图像质量与基线相当或更好。

Conclusion: HilbertA证明了硬件对齐的二维稀疏注意力在高分辨率图像生成中的可行性。

Abstract: Designing sparse attention for diffusion transformers requires reconciling
two-dimensional spatial locality with GPU efficiency, a trade-off that current
methods struggle to achieve. Existing approaches enforce two-dimensional
spatial locality but often incur uncoalesced memory access. We present
HilbertA, a 2D-aware and GPU-efficient sparse attention mechanism. HilbertA
reorders image tokens along Hilbert curves to achieve a contiguous memory
layout while preserving spatial neighborhoods, and employs a sliding schedule
across layers to enable long-range information propagation without repeated or
uncoalesced memory access. To further enhance cross-tile communication and
positional awareness, HilbertA introduces a small central shared region.
Implemented in Triton, HilbertA delivers comparable image quality with
significant acceleration over prior methods on Flux.1-dev, demonstrating the
feasibility of hardware-aligned two-dimensional sparse attention for
high-resolution image generation. HilbertA delivers attention speedups of
$2.3\times$ when generating $1024\times 1024$ images, and up to $4.17\times$ at
$2048\times 2048$, while achieving image quality comparable to or surpassing
baselines.

Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、开放式前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助哪些推理任务，填补当前AI能力与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个分解检查点任务，由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究设计新问题，采用自动化评分流程验证物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在检查点任务上显示初步潜力，但在完整研究挑战中表现差：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后提升至约10%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与真实物理研究需求存在巨大差距，CritPt为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了标准化评估基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

TL;DR: 该研究通过蜕变测试评估了三个小型语言模型在RAG管道中的公平性，发现轻微的人口统计变化会破坏多达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要违规原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在安全性和公平性问题，包括公平性缺陷和幻觉。RAG虽然能缓解幻觉，但检索内容可能放大偏见，需要评估其公平性影响。

Method: 使用蜕变测试方法，在提示中引入受控的人口统计扰动，评估三个HuggingFace上的小型语言模型在情感分析任务中的公平性表现。

Result: 结果显示，轻微的人口统计变化会破坏多达三分之一的蜕变关系，种族线索是主要的违规原因，存在一致的偏见层次结构。

Conclusion: RAG中的检索组件需要仔细筛选以防止偏见放大，为开发者和组织采用可访问的小型语言模型提供了实践警示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across multiple domains but
continue to raise concerns regarding security and fairness. Beyond known attack
vectors such as data poisoning and prompt injection, LLMs are also vulnerable
to fairness bugs. These refer to unintended behaviors influenced by sensitive
demographic cues (e.g., race or sexual orientation) that should not affect
outcomes. Another key issue is hallucination, where models generate plausible
yet false information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
strategy to mitigate hallucinations by combining external retrieval with text
generation. However, its adoption raises new fairness concerns, as the
retrieved content itself may surface or amplify bias. This study conducts
fairness testing through metamorphic testing (MT), introducing controlled
demographic perturbations in prompts to assess fairness in sentiment analysis
performed by three Small Language Models (SLMs) hosted on HuggingFace
(Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B),
each integrated into a RAG pipeline. Results show that minor demographic
variations can break up to one third of metamorphic relations (MRs). A detailed
analysis of these failures reveals a consistent bias hierarchy, with
perturbations involving racial cues being the predominant cause of the
violations. In addition to offering a comparative evaluation, this work
reinforces that the retrieval component in RAG must be carefully curated to
prevent bias amplification. The findings serve as a practical alert for
developers, testers and small organizations aiming to adopt accessible SLMs
without compromising fairness or reliability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人、工业控制和医疗等安全关键领域的应用受到两个主要障碍的阻碍：难以准确指定奖励函数，以及不安全、数据饥渴的探索风险。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 从无奖励的专家演示数据集中离线学习安全初始策略；2) 使用基于偏好的人类反馈进行在线微调。提出了BRIDGE算法，通过不确定性加权目标整合两种信号。

Result: 在离散和连续控制的MuJoCo环境中验证了BRIDGE，显示其比单独的行为克隆和基于偏好的在线强化学习具有更低的遗憾。理论分析表明遗憾界限随离线演示数量减少，明确连接了离线数据量与在线样本效率。

Conclusion: 为设计更样本高效的交互式智能体建立了理论基础，证明了离线到在线方法的有效性。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in robotics, industry, and health care
is blocked by two obstacles: the difficulty of specifying accurate rewards and
the risk of unsafe, data-hungry exploration. We address this by proposing a
two-stage framework that first learns a safe initial policy from a reward-free
dataset of expert demonstrations, then fine-tunes it online using
preference-based human feedback. We provide the first principled analysis of
this offline-to-online approach and introduce BRIDGE, a unified algorithm that
integrates both signals via an uncertainty-weighted objective. We derive regret
bounds that shrink with the number of offline demonstrations, explicitly
connecting the quantity of offline data to online sample efficiency. We
validate BRIDGE in discrete and continuous control MuJoCo environments, showing
it achieves lower regret than both standalone behavioral cloning and online
preference-based RL. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for
designing more sample-efficient interactive agents.

TL;DR: TimeRewarder是一种从被动视频中学习密集奖励的方法，通过建模帧间时间距离来估计任务进度，为强化学习提供逐步代理奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人强化学习中，手动设计密集奖励需要大量工作且难以扩展，而任务进度可以作为密集奖励信号来量化动作推进任务完成的程度。

Method: 从机器人演示和人类视频中提取进度估计信号，通过建模帧对之间的时间距离来学习奖励函数，为稀疏奖励任务提供逐步代理奖励。

Result: 在10个Meta-World任务中，TimeRewarder显著改进了强化学习性能，在9/10任务中达到近乎完美的成功率，仅需每个任务20万次环境交互，优于先前方法和手动设计的密集奖励。

Conclusion: TimeRewarder提供了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样化视频源获取丰富的奖励信号，包括利用真实世界人类视频进行预训练。

Abstract: Designing dense rewards is crucial for reinforcement learning (RL), yet in
robotics it often demands extensive manual effort and lacks scalability. One
promising solution is to view task progress as a dense reward signal, as it
quantifies the degree to which actions advance the system toward task
completion over time. We present TimeRewarder, a simple yet effective reward
learning method that derives progress estimation signals from passive videos,
including robot demonstrations and human videos, by modeling temporal distances
between frame pairs. We then demonstrate how TimeRewarder can supply step-wise
proxy rewards to guide reinforcement learning. In our comprehensive experiments
on ten challenging Meta-World tasks, we show that TimeRewarder dramatically
improves RL for sparse-reward tasks, achieving nearly perfect success in 9/10
tasks with only 200,000 interactions per task with the environment. This
approach outperformed previous methods and even the manually designed
environment dense reward on both the final success rate and sample efficiency.
Moreover, we show that TimeRewarder pretraining can exploit real-world human
videos, highlighting its potential as a scalable approach path to rich reward
signals from diverse video sources.

Conclusion: 测量树为更广泛和可解释的AI评估提供了原则性基础，通过透明方法操作复杂构造的测量。

Abstract: This paper introduces \textit{measurement trees}, a novel class of metrics
designed to combine various constructs into an interpretable multi-level
representation of a measurand. Unlike conventional metrics that yield single
values, vectors, surfaces, or categories, measurement trees produce a
hierarchical directed graph in which each node summarizes its children through
user-defined aggregation methods. In response to recent calls to expand the
scope of AI system evaluation, measurement trees enhance metric transparency
and facilitate the integration of heterogeneous evidence, including, e.g.,
agentic, business, energy-efficiency, sociotechnical, or security signals. We
present definitions and examples, demonstrate practical utility through a
large-scale measurement exercise, and provide accompanying open-source Python
code. By operationalizing a transparent approach to measurement of complex
constructs, this work offers a principled foundation for broader and more
interpretable AI evaluation.

Abstract: Producing interactive 3D printed objects currently requires laborious 3D
design and post-instrumentation with off-the-shelf electronics. Multi-material
3D printing using conductive PLA presents opportunities to mitigate these
challenges. We present a computational design pipeline that embeds multiple
capacitive touchpoints into any 3D model that has a closed mesh without
self-intersection. With our pipeline, users define touchpoints on the 3D
object's surface to indicate interactive regions. Our pipeline then
automatically generates a conductive path to connect the touch regions. This
path is optimized to output unique resistor-capacitor delays when each region
is touched, resulting in all regions being able to be sensed through a
double-wire or single-wire connection. We illustrate our approach's utility
with five computational and sensing performance evaluations (achieving 93.35%
mean accuracy for single-wire) and six application examples. Our sensing
technique supports existing uses (e.g., prototyping) and highlights the growing
promise to produce interactive devices entirely with 3D printing.

Conclusion: 该方法在变形动力学模拟中实现了比传统线性方法更高的精度，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Linear reduced-order modeling (ROM) is widely used for efficient simulation
of deformation dynamics, but its accuracy is often limited by the fixed
linearization of the reduced mapping. We propose a new adaptive strategy for
linear ROM that allows the reduced mapping to vary dynamically in response to
the evolving deformation state, significantly improving accuracy over
traditional linear approaches. To further handle large deformations, we
introduce a historical displacement basis combined with Grassmann
interpolation, enabling the system to recover robustly even in challenging
scenarios. We evaluate our method through quantitative online-error analysis
and qualitative comparisons with principal component analysis (PCA)-based
linear ROM simulations, demonstrating substantial accuracy gains while
preserving comparable computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动重定向方法依赖手工约束或配对数据集，限制了其在非人形角色和复杂行为上的应用，且忽视了领域特定目标如风格保持和任务空间对齐。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用VQ-VAE训练每个角色的标记化运动嵌入，然后通过条件耦合的流匹配来对齐不同角色的潜在空间。

Result: 实验表明MoReFlow能在多样化角色和任务上生成高质量运动，相比基线方法具有更好的可控性、泛化能力和运动真实感。

Conclusion: MoReFlow提供了一种无需配对数据的灵活可逆运动重定向方法，显著提升了跨角色运动转换的质量和适用性。

Abstract: Motion retargeting holds a premise of offering a larger set of motion data
for characters and robots with different morphologies. Many prior works have
approached this problem via either handcrafted constraints or paired motion
datasets, limiting their applicability to humanoid characters or narrow
behaviors such as locomotion. Moreover, they often assume a fixed notion of
retargeting, overlooking domain-specific objectives like style preservation in
animation or task-space alignment in robotics. In this work, we propose
MoReFlow, Motion Retargeting via Flow Matching, an unsupervised framework that
learns correspondences between characters' motion embedding spaces. Our method
consists of two stages. First, we train tokenized motion embeddings for each
character using a VQ-VAE, yielding compact latent representations. Then, we
employ flow matching with conditional coupling to align the latent spaces
across characters, which simultaneously learns conditioned and unconditioned
matching to achieve robust but flexible retargeting. Once trained, MoReFlow
enables flexible and reversible retargeting without requiring paired data.
Experiments demonstrate that MoReFlow produces high-quality motions across
diverse characters and tasks, offering improved controllability,
generalization, and motion realism compared to the baselines.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分运动轨迹（DMT）的端到端矢量草图动画自动生成方法，通过多项式轨迹描述笔画控制点的帧间运动，解决了闪烁问题并提高了时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频草图动画生成面临时间一致性挑战，现有方法存在闪烁问题，需要一种能保持语义一致性和时间连贯性的解决方案。

Method: 引入可微分运动轨迹（DMT）表示，使用基于多项式的轨迹描述笔画控制点的帧间运动；采用Bernstein基函数平衡多项式参数敏感性；引入稀疏跟踪点进行显式空间建模。

Result: 在DAVIS和LVOS数据集上的评估表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法；在3D模型和文本到视频数据的跨域验证中表现出鲁棒性和兼容性。

Conclusion: DMT方法通过全局语义梯度传播显著提高了语义一致性和时间连贯性，能够生成高帧率输出，并支持长时视频处理。

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the
given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses
existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By
successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Tensor datasets (two-, three-, or higher-dimensional) are fundamental to many
scientific fields utilizing imaging or simulation technologies. Advances in
these methods have led to ever-increasing data sizes and, consequently,
interest and development of out-of-core processing and visualization
techniques, although mostly as specialized solutions. Here we present Palace,
an open-source, cross-platform, general-purpose library for interactive and
accelerated out-of-core tensor processing and visualization. Through a
high-performance asynchronous concurrent architecture and a simple
compute-graph interface, Palace enables the interactive development of
out-of-core pipelines on workstation hardware. We demonstrate on benchmarks
that Palace outperforms or matches state-of-the-art systems for volume
rendering and hierarchical random-walker segmentation and demonstrate
applicability in use cases involving tensors from 2D images up to 4D time
series datasets.

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:
