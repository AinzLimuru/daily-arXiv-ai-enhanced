### [1] [LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01339)
*Alessio Spagnoletti,Andrés Almansa,Marcelo Pereyra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVTINO是首个基于视频一致性模型(VCMs)的零样本视频恢复逆求解器，通过绕过自动微分实现高效计算，在保持测量一致性和时间平滑性的同时，显著提升了视频重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图像潜在扩散模型(LDMs)的零样本逆求解器在图像恢复方面表现出色，但直接应用于视频恢复时会出现时间不一致问题。需要开发能够同时恢复空间细节和捕捉时间依赖性的视频恢复方法。

Method: 利用视频一致性模型(VCMs)作为先验，提出LVTINO零样本逆求解器。通过条件机制绕过自动微分需求，仅需少量神经网络评估即可实现高质量视频重建，确保测量一致性和帧间平滑过渡。

Result: 在多种视频逆问题上的实验表明，LVTINO相比逐帧应用图像LDM的方法在感知质量上有显著提升，在重建保真度和计算效率方面都建立了新的基准。

Conclusion: LVTINO通过整合视频一致性模型，成功解决了视频恢复中的时间一致性问题，为高分辨率视频逆问题提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

### [2] [Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01347)
*Shuochen Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于三阶段训练的风格提取图像生成方法，通过风格编码器和风格投影层将风格表示与文本表示对齐，实现基于文本提示的细粒度风格引导生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成模型中细粒度风格难以用自然语言精确描述和控制的问题，以及风格参考图像的指导信息难以与传统文本引导生成直接对齐的挑战。

Method: 使用风格编码器和风格投影层从单一风格参考图像中提取细粒度风格表示，并将其注入到预训练生成模型中而不改变其结构框架。构建了包含图像、风格标签和文本描述三元组的Style30k-captions数据集进行训练。

Result: 实现了细粒度控制的风格化图像生成，能够基于文本提示精确控制生成图像的风格特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够充分利用预训练生成模型的生成能力，通过风格表示与文本表示的对齐，实现了细粒度的风格控制图像生成。

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

### [3] [EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across Activities and Skill Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01362)
*Shijia Feng,Michael Wray,Walterio Mayol-Cuevas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究收集了一个包含61.68小时视频、2,793个视频和5,385个标注时间段的挣扎检测数据集，用于研究技能习得过程中挣扎行为的演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有操纵数据集未关注挣扎行为随时间的变化，而理解这种演变对于确定用户当前学习阶段和开发有效辅助系统至关重要。

Method: 收集了76名参与者在18个任务（分为打结、折纸、七巧板、洗牌四类活动）上的视频数据，每个任务重复五次以捕捉技能演变。将挣扎检测定义为时间动作定位任务。

Result: 时间动作定位模型能够成功学习检测挣扎线索，在未见任务和活动上的平均mAP分别为34.56%和19.24%，表明挣扎是一个可跨任务迁移的概念。

Conclusion: 挣扎检测是一个具有挑战性但可行的任务，挣扎概念在不同技能任务间具有可迁移性，为未来改进挣扎检测提供了基础。

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

### [4] [SPUS: A Lightweight and Parameter-Efficient Foundation Model for PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01370)
*Abu Bucker Siddik,Diane Oyen,Alexander Most,Michal Kucer,Ayan Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPUS是一个紧凑高效的偏微分方程求解基础模型，采用轻量级残差U-Net架构，通过自回归预训练策略学习物理规律，在多种下游PDE任务上达到最先进的泛化性能，且参数更少、微调数据需求更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型主要基于大型复杂transformer架构，计算和参数开销高，需要探索更轻量高效的架构作为基础模型。

Method: 使用轻量级残差U-Net架构，采用自回归预训练策略模拟数值求解器行为来学习物理规律，在流体动力学PDE数据集上预训练。

Result: 在6个未见过的下游PDE任务上达到最先进的泛化性能，同时参数数量显著减少，微调数据需求最小化。

Conclusion: SPUS展示了残差U-Net作为参数高效基础模型在解决多样化PDE系统方面的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

### [5] [DisCo: Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints for Multi-Human Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01399)
*Shubhankar Borse,Farzad Farhadzadeh,Munawar Hayat,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过多样性约束直接优化多人生成中的身份多样性，解决了文本到图像模型在多人提示下重复面孔、合并身份和计数错误的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型在现实主义方面表现出色，但在处理多人提示时会出现面部重复、身份合并和个体计数错误的问题，这被称为生成模型中的'身份危机'。

Method: DisCo通过群体相对策略优化(GRPO)微调流匹配模型，使用组合奖励函数：(i)惩罚图像内面部相似性，(ii)阻止跨样本身份重复，(iii)确保准确的人员计数，(iv)通过人类偏好评分保持视觉保真度。采用单阶段课程学习来稳定训练复杂度扩展。

Result: 在DiverseHumans测试集上，DisCo实现了98.6%的独特面部准确率和接近完美的全局身份分布，超越了开源和专有方法(如Gemini、GPT-Image)，同时保持了竞争力的感知质量。

Conclusion: DisCo作为一个可扩展、无需额外标注的解决方案，解决了生成模型中长期存在的身份危机问题，并为组合多人生成设定了新的基准。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

### [6] [GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of Geographic Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01448)
*Angel Daruna,Nicholas Meegan,Han-Pang Chiu,Supun Samarasekera,Rakesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉地理定位方法，通过将查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示对齐，使用分层地理嵌入模型，并结合外观特征与语义分割图，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球视觉地理定位问题，即仅使用图像视觉内容确定其在地球上的地理位置。尽管已有进展，但学习地理表示仍是一个活跃的研究方向。

Method: 将地理定位问题表述为对齐查询图像的视觉表示与学习的地理表示。使用分层地理嵌入模型表示世界，并引入有效融合图像外观特征与语义分割图的方法，形成鲁棒的视觉表示。

Result: 在5个基准数据集的25个指标中，22个指标达到了新的最佳性能，超越了先前的最先进方法和大型视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 消融研究表明，这些性能提升主要归功于地理表示与视觉表示的结合。

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

### [7] [Data Selection for Fine-tuning Vision Language Models via Cross Modal Alignment Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01454)
*Nilay Naharas,Dang Nguyen,Nesihan Bulut,Mohammadhossein Bateni,Vahab Mirrokni,Baharan Mirzasoleiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了XMAS方法，通过分析跨模态注意力矩阵的轨迹来聚类示例，从而有效去除大规模视觉语言模型训练数据中的冗余，在保持性能的同时显著减少训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据选择方法在大型视觉语言模型上表现不佳，无法超越随机选择，需要开发专门针对LVLM的高效数据选择方法。

Method: 基于跨模态注意力矩阵相似性的理论分析，提出XMAS方法：通过聚类示例的注意力矩阵轨迹，从不同聚类中平衡采样来构建训练子集。

Result: XMAS能在LLaVA-665k数据集上丢弃50%数据，在Vision-Flan数据集上丢弃85%数据，同时完全保持LLaVA-1.5-7B在10个下游基准上的性能，训练速度提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: XMAS是首个针对LVLM指令调优的高效数据选择方法，能显著减少训练数据冗余，在保持模型性能的同时提升训练效率。

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

### [8] [Purrception: Variational Flow Matching for Vector-Quantized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01478)
*Răzvan-Andrei Matişan,Vincent Tao Hu,Grigory Bartosh,Björn Ommer,Cees G. M. Snoek,Max Welling,Jan-Willem van de Meent,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Floor Eijkelboom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Purrception是一种用于矢量量化图像生成的变分流匹配方法，结合了连续传输动态和离散监督，在ImageNet-1k 256x256图像生成上实现了快速收敛和竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决连续流方法缺乏离散监督和离散流方法缺乏几何感知的问题，需要一种能够同时利用连续传输动态和离散监督的方法来改进图像生成训练效率。

Method: 通过将变分流匹配适配到矢量量化潜在空间，在连续嵌入空间中计算速度场的同时学习码书索引的类别后验分布，结合连续方法的几何感知和离散方法的监督优势。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k 256x256生成任务中，训练收敛速度比连续流匹配和离散流匹配基线更快，同时达到与最先进模型竞争的FID分数。

Conclusion: 变分流匹配能够有效桥接连续传输和离散监督，为图像生成提供改进的训练效率。

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

### [9] [AortaDiff: A Unified Multitask Diffusion Framework For Contrast-Free AAA Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01498)
*Yuxuan Ou,Ning Bi,Jiazhen Pan,Jiancheng Yang,Boliang Yu,Usama Zidan,Regent Lee,Vicente Grau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的深度学习框架，从非对比CT扫描生成合成对比增强CT图像，同时分割主动脉腔和血栓，通过条件扩散模型和多任务学习实现端到端联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比增强CT需要使用碘对比剂，存在肾毒性、患者过敏和环境危害等风险。现有方法采用多阶段流程，导致错误累积且无法利用共享的语义和解剖结构。

Method: 集成条件扩散模型与多任务学习，共享编码器和解码器参数，采用半监督训练策略处理缺失分割标签的临床数据，无需初始预测。

Result: 在264名患者队列中表现优于现有单任务和多阶段模型：图像合成PSNR达25.61 dB，腔分割Dice分数0.89，血栓分割Dice分数0.53，临床测量误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化图像合成和解剖分割，有效减少了对比剂使用，提高了分割精度和临床测量准确性。

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

*Basem Rizk,Joel Walsh,Mark Core,Benjamin Nye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于多模态内容分析的高效原型框架，将视频转换为时间半结构化数据格式，并进一步转化为可查询的知识图谱表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态内容分析复杂且计算昂贵，现有预训练模型难以与视频等复杂数据融合，需要大量工程努力

Method: 构建候选管道配方，结合预训练模型将视频转换为时间半结构化数据，再转化为帧级索引知识图谱

Result: 创建了可查询的知识图谱表示，支持持续学习，能够通过交互方式动态整合新的领域特定知识

Conclusion: 该框架能够高效原型化多模态内容分析管道，简化了复杂数据与开源模型的融合过程

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WALT框架通过逆向工程网站功能创建可复用工具，让Web智能体调用高级操作而非逐步交互，提高了浏览器自动化的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Web智能体方法依赖逐步UI交互和大量LLM推理，在动态布局和长任务中表现脆弱，而人类使用网站提供的高级功能如搜索、筛选、排序等更高效。

Method: WALT框架逆向工程网站潜在功能，将其转化为可调用的工具，包括发现（搜索、筛选、排序）、通信（发布、评论、点赞）和内容管理（创建、编辑、删除）等操作。

Result: 在VisualWebArena和WebArena测试中，WALT以更少步骤和更低LLM依赖实现更高成功率。

Conclusion: WALT建立了将计算负担从脆弱的逐步推理转移到可靠工具调用的鲁棒且可推广的浏览器自动化范式。

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于半监督分割的拓扑一致性框架，通过多重扰动预测和时空训练快照来保持语义结构，特别适用于密集分布的组织病理学图像分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在半监督分割中，从未标记数据中捕捉有意义的语义结构至关重要，特别是在组织病理学图像分析中，由于对象密集分布，这一任务更具挑战性。

Method: 利用随机dropout和时间训练快照获得多重扰动预测，通过集成空间重叠和全局结构对齐的新型匹配策略，强制实现拓扑一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法有效减少了拓扑错误，产生了更鲁棒和准确的分割结果，这对于可靠的下游分析至关重要。

Conclusion: 提出的拓扑一致性框架能够有效区分生物意义结构与噪声伪影，在半监督分割中实现了更鲁棒和准确的结果。

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

### [13] [Towards Better Optimization For Listwise Preference in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01540)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Diffusion-LPO框架，用于在扩散模型中实现列表式偏好优化，利用排名信息比成对比较更精确地捕捉人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法主要依赖成对偏好，但人类对图像的反馈通常包含隐含的排名信息，能更精确地表达偏好。列表式偏好优化在扩散模型中尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce模型推导DPO目标的列表式扩展，将用户反馈聚合成图像排名列表，鼓励每个样本优于其所有低排名替代品。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和个性化偏好对齐等任务中，Diffusion-LPO在视觉质量和偏好对齐方面持续优于成对DPO基线。

Conclusion: Diffusion-LPO是一个简单有效的框架，能够利用列表式数据更好地对齐扩散模型与人类偏好。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Motivation: 构建同时支持理解和生成的统一多模态大语言模型具有挑战性：混合方法破坏了自回归范式，而纯自回归方法在语义对齐和像素级保真度之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用混合Transformer架构，提出语义到像素的离散表示，将紧凑的语义token与细粒度像素token结合，在序列长度仅增加7.9%的情况下实现强语言对齐和精确的视觉细节描述。

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中，Bridge在理解和生成基准上都取得了竞争性或更优的结果，同时需要更少的训练数据和更短的训练时间。

Conclusion: Bridge证明了纯自回归统一多模态大语言模型的可行性，在保持自回归范式的同时实现了高质量的图像理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结合CNN与贝叶斯深度学习的混合模型，用于小数据集下的口腔癌分类，通过变分推理进行不确定性量化，在真实世界图像数据上展现出更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔癌是全球高发癌症，早期诊断对降低死亡率至关重要。传统深度学习模型需要大数据集，在医疗资源匮乏地区难以实现，且存在过度自信和可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络与贝叶斯深度学习相结合的混合模型，采用变分推理进行不确定性量化，在智能手机拍摄的彩色图像上进行训练和测试。

Result: 在训练数据分布相似的测试集上达到94%准确率，与传统CNN相当；在真实世界图像数据上达到88%准确率，显著优于传统CNN的72.94%。模型对正确分类样本表现出高置信度，对错误分类样本表现出低置信度。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯推理在数据稀缺环境下能有效提高口腔癌早期诊断的模型可靠性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFDA方法容易受到困难样本和域偏差的影响，无法充分表示多样性特征。

Method: 构建辅助域模块获取多样化表示，通过一致性策略区分简单和困难样本，使用CMK-MMD策略对齐困难样本。

Result: 在Office-31、Office-Home、VISDA-C和DomainNet-126等基准测试中取得显著性能提升。

Conclusion: CADTrans方法有效解决了SFDA中的域偏差和困难样本问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉解释应用中虽然准确，但往往提供冗长且与上下文无关的描述，导致BLV用户需要筛选大量无关信息。

Method: 利用VizWiz-LF数据集中的历史BLV用户问题，当给定图像时识别相似视觉上下文，并用相关问题指导MLLM生成更相关的描述。

Result: 评估显示，上下文感知描述在76.1%的情况下能够预判并回答用户问题，在54.4%的比较中被用户偏好。

Conclusion: 基于历史用户问题指导MLLM生成上下文感知描述的方法能有效提高描述的相关性和用户体验。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

Motivation: 传统逆问题方法通常忽略感知矩阵零空间的特定结构，导致重建质量受限。本文旨在利用零空间的结构信息来设计更有效的正则化方法。

Method: 提出NPN方法，使用神经网络学习感知矩阵零空间的低维投影，将解约束在该投影空间中，可与现有重建框架兼容使用。

Result: 在压缩感知、去模糊、超分辨率、CT和MRI等多种成像逆问题中，NPN先验显著提高了重建保真度，适用于plug-and-play、展开网络、深度图像先验和扩散模型等框架。

Conclusion: NPN方法通过关注感知矩阵零空间的结构，提供了一种可解释且灵活的正则化策略，能有效提升各种成像逆问题的重建性能。

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Conclusion: 该工作为基因组医学中的机器人和临床自动化建立了可靠基础，通过可解释的基因组建模支持自动化决策，减少不必要的重复测试并提高效率。

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA
sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration
into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game
Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing
predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC
content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate
concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution
matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV
subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers
interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation
in genomic medicine.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型缺乏显式的逐步推理过程，不考虑环境约束和几何关系，且后训练流程很少强化推理质量。

Method: 集成RLVR（可验证奖励强化学习）和GRPO（组相对策略优化），设计基于RLVR的后训练策略，包含区域对齐、轨迹一致性和输出格式的可验证奖励。

Result: 在领域内、领域外、仿真和真实机器人平台上的广泛评估显示，VLA-R1相比先前VLA方法实现了更优的泛化能力和真实世界性能。

Conclusion: VLA-R1通过系统优化推理和执行，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化能力和真实世界表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微距摄影中的散焦模糊严重阻碍了清晰成像和高质量3D重建，传统方法需要大量图像和标注，且目前没有针对微距摄影的多视角3D重建方法。

Method: 从多视角模糊图像出发，联合优化物体的清晰3D模型和每个像素的散焦模糊核，采用可微分渲染方法进行自监督优化。

Result: 实验表明，从少量多视角图像中，该方法不仅能实现高质量图像去模糊，还能恢复高保真度的3D外观。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了微距摄影中的散焦模糊问题，实现了联合去模糊和3D重建，为小物体细节的3D建模提供了新方案。

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的图像去模糊方法存在推理时间过长和保真度不足的问题，限制了其在真实世界应用中的潜力。

Method: 将运动模糊重新定义为类似扩散的过程，每个时间步代表逐渐模糊的图像；训练一致性模型将所有时间步对齐到同一清晰图像；整合Kernel ControlNet进行模糊核估计并引入自适应时间步预测。

Conclusion: FideDiff为预训练扩散模型在高保真图像恢复任务中的应用提供了新方向，为工业应用中的扩散模型建立了稳健基准。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 青铜器铭文是早期中国文字的重要阶段，但由于严重的视觉退化、多领域变异性（照片、拓片、描摹）和极端长尾字符分布，自动识别仍然困难。

Method: 构建包含22454张全页图像和198598个标注字符的大规模数据集；开发两阶段检测-识别流程，使用LadderMoE增强CLIP编码器，通过阶梯式MoE适配器实现动态专家专业化和更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 为青铜器铭文识别和下游考古分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA方法需要为每个新的源-目标对微调整个骨干网络，导致训练参数和存储需求线性增长，且无法重用训练好的骨干网络参数。

Method: 在骨干网络前添加域特定的视觉重编程层，生成视觉提示作为纹理偏置来调整输入图像的风格，通过优化域内和域间分布差异来训练这些层，而不修改骨干网络参数。

Result: 在Office-31数据集上达到92.8%的平均准确率，仅需1.5M可训练参数，优于现有参数高效UDA基线方法PDA，且参数量仅为CDTrans和FixBi的1.7%和2.8%。

Conclusion: VirDA提供了一种参数高效的领域自适应解决方案，能够在保持高性能的同时显著减少训练参数，实现骨干网络在不同领域间的重用。

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为离散面部编码（DFE）的无监督方法，通过残差向量量化变分自编码器从3D网格序列中学习紧凑且可解释的面部表情字典，在心理任务中优于传统FACS编码系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情编码系统（如FACS）存在覆盖范围有限和手动标注成本高的问题，需要一种数据驱动、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 首先使用3D可变形模型提取身份不变的表情特征，然后通过残差向量量化变分自编码器将这些特征编码为来自共享码本的离散标记序列，每个标记捕获特定的可重用面部变形模式。

Result: DFE比FACS和其他面部编码方法捕获更精确的面部行为，在压力检测、人格预测和抑郁检测三个心理任务中，使用简单的词袋模型即可持续优于FACS基线和强大的图像/视频表示学习模型。

Conclusion: DFE作为一种可扩展且有效的替代方案，具有覆盖更广泛面部显示的潜力，适用于心理学和情感计算应用。

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖严格假设（如局部平面表面或局部线性变形）且无法恢复保形尺度，需要消除这些约束并提高重建精度。

Method: 使用基于图的框架优化2D选定图像扭曲进行逐点重建，采用并行可分离迭代优化策略，并结合自监督学习框架生成带纹理的密集3D点云。

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

TL;DR: UniVerse是一个统一的鲁棒重建框架，通过将不一致的多视角图像转换为视频，使用视频扩散模型恢复为一致图像，然后重建3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从不一致多视角图像进行3D重建的挑战，现有方法依赖密集观测且优化困难。

Method: 将鲁棒重建分解为恢复和重建两个子任务，使用视频扩散模型学习通用场景先验来恢复不一致图像。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现出强大的泛化能力和优越性能，并能控制重建3D场景的风格。

Conclusion: UniVerse通过解耦恢复和重建任务，利用扩散模型的通用先验，有效解决了多视角图像不一致的3D重建问题。

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

*Ke Jia,Ji Zhou,Hanxin Li,Zhigan Zhou,Haojie Chu,Xiaojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级端到端模板匹配框架，将模板匹配重新定义为联合定位和几何回归问题，输出中心坐标、旋转角度和独立缩放比例，在复杂背景下实现高效姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模板匹配方法依赖穷举角度和尺度，效率低下；而大多数深度学习方法只估计相似度得分，没有显式建模几何姿态，无法满足实际部署需求。

Method: 使用模板感知动态卷积模块(TDCM)在推理时动态注入模板特征，结合深度可分离卷积和像素洗牌实现高效匹配；采用旋转-剪切增强策略和结构感知伪标签实现无几何标注训练；通过轻量级优化模块提升角度和尺度精度。

Result: 3.07M参数的模型在复合变换下实现高精度和14ms推理速度，在小模板和多目标场景中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于实时工业应用部署，在复杂背景下实现了高效的模板匹配和姿态估计。

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Jiahui Gao,Renjie Pi,Shiyu Hu,Wentao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个自适应像素推理框架，通过动态确定必要的像素级操作来提升视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉任务中的性能，同时显著减少不必要的视觉操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理需要精确理解细粒度视觉元素的任务时经常表现不佳，主要原因是图像编码过程中的信息丢失或对关键区域关注不足。现有方法引入像素级信息但容易过度使用，导致效率低下和无关细节干扰。

Method: 首先进行操作感知的监督微调以建立文本推理和视觉操作的基础能力，然后设计基于模型自身响应反馈的rollout引导强化学习框架，使VLM能够根据查询难度动态决定何时调用像素操作。

Result: 在广泛的多模态推理基准测试中，模型实现了优越性能同时显著减少不必要的视觉操作。在HR-Bench 4K上达到73.4%准确率，工具使用率仅为20.1%，相比先前方法在提高准确率的同时减少了66.5%的工具使用。

Conclusion: 该自适应像素推理框架有效解决了VLM在细粒度视觉任务中的挑战，通过动态决策机制实现了性能提升与效率优化的平衡。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于增强敏感性的风险评分框架（ASRS），用于识别胸片图像中易出错的病例，通过测量图像旋转后的嵌入变化来评估模型稳定性，提高医疗AI的公平性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸片解读中表现良好，但在患者亚组间存在准确性不均的问题，现有错误检测方法难以处理分布内的细微错误，需要更有效的错误识别方法。

Method: 使用临床合理的旋转增强（±15°/±30°），通过RAD-DINO编码器测量嵌入变化，计算敏感性评分并将样本分为稳定性四分位数。

Result: 高敏感性病例的召回率显著降低（-0.2至-0.3），尽管AUROC和置信度较高，证明了ASRS在识别易出错病例方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ASRS提供了一种无需标签的选择性预测和临床医生审查方法，能够改善医疗AI的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频风格化方法存在时间不一致性、风格丰富度不足的问题，而训练专用模型需要配对视频数据且计算成本高。

Method: 整合多个风格化参考到预训练I2V模型，使用高频补偿约束内容布局和运动，结合基于光流的运动线索保留低显著性区域的风格纹理。

Result: FreeViS在风格化保真度和时间一致性方面优于现有基线方法，获得强烈的人类偏好。

Conclusion: 该无需训练的流程为高质量、时间一致性的视频风格化提供了实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像质量评估方法受限于标量评分指标，无法反映专家评估中的人类推理过程，需要建立更符合人类推理的评估范式。

Method: 定义MedQ-Perception（感知任务）和MedQ-Reasoning（推理任务），包含2600个感知查询和708个推理评估，采用多维判断协议评估模型输出。

Result: 评估14个最先进MLLM显示模型具有初步但不稳定的感知和推理能力，准确性不足以可靠临床使用。

Conclusion: MLLM在医学图像质量评估中需要针对性优化，MedQ-Bench将推动进一步探索并释放MLLM在医学图像质量评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate
for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar,
score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning
process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在理解实例级几何关系时依赖昂贵的输入格式（类别标签、分割掩码）和二次方的前向传播次数，限制了实际应用。

Method: InstaFormer通过对象查询与潜在掩码描述符之间的交互，语义化表示相同对象并携带互补信息，实现整体顺序预测。

Result: 通过全面基准测试和消融实验验证了方法的有效性，代码和模型已开源。

Conclusion: InstaFormer在单次前向传播中有效预测场景中所有实例的完整遮挡和深度排序，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a
challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized
systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels,
binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward
passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network
capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary
information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight
its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this
URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

TL;DR: PyramidStyler是一个基于Transformer的神经风格迁移框架，通过金字塔位置编码和强化学习优化，实现了高效的高分辨率图像风格化处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN和Transformer模型在处理复杂风格和高分辨率输入时存在效率问题，需要更高效的风格迁移方法。

Method: 提出PyramidStyler框架，采用金字塔位置编码(PPE)捕捉多尺度特征，并结合强化学习动态优化风格化过程。

Result: 在4000轮训练后，内容损失降低62.6%至2.07，风格损失降低57.4%至0.86，推理时间1.39秒；使用RL后进一步改善至内容损失2.03、风格损失0.75，推理时间1.40秒。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了实时高质量艺术渲染，在媒体和设计领域具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based
algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN
and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles
and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework
with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding
that captures both local details and global context while reducing
computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to
dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on
Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to
2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s
inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with
minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate
real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media

TL;DR: LoBE-GS是一个负载平衡的高效3D高斯泼溅框架，解决了大规模场景重建中的负载不平衡和训练效率问题，实现了2倍加速训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分治方法在大规模无边界场景中存在负载不平衡问题，均匀分割无法反映实际计算需求，粗到细流水线效率低下。

Method: 引入深度感知分区方法减少预处理时间，基于优化的策略平衡可见高斯分布，使用可见性裁剪和选择性致密化技术降低训练成本。

Conclusion: LoBE-GS通过重新设计大规模3DGS流水线，有效解决了负载不平衡和训练效率问题，实现了高效的大规模场景重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

TL;DR: 提出了MemoryPack和Direct Forcing两种方法来解决长视频生成中的长期依赖建模和错误累积问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成面临双重挑战：需要捕获长期依赖关系，同时防止自回归解码中固有的错误累积

Method: 1. MemoryPack：可学习的上下文检索机制，利用文本和图像信息作为全局指导，联合建模短期和长期依赖；2. Direct Forcing：高效的单步近似策略，改善训练-推理对齐

Result: 实现了分钟级的时间一致性，计算效率高且保持线性复杂度，显著提升了长视频生成的上下文一致性和可靠性

Conclusion: MemoryPack和Direct Forcing共同推进了自回归视频模型的实际可用性

Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture
long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in
autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two
contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a
learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image
information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term
dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales
gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自主系统中，精确的物体检测和不确定性估计对于自感知和安全操作至关重要。需要关注完整预测置信度分布在所有类别上的校准，而不仅仅是主导类别。

Method: 提出了两种辅助正则化损失项：一种校准主导预测，另一种校准完整预测向量；评估了多种后处理和训练时方法，包括等渗回归。

Result: 结合完整类别预测校准损失项和等渗回归，在CenterPoint和PillarNet上实现了主导和次要类别预测的最佳校准效果；但DSVT-Pillar无法使用相同方法同时校准主导和次要预测。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升3D物体检测器的置信度校准性能，特别是对于完整预测分布的校准，但不同检测器架构需要针对性的校准策略。

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation
are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence
calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Method: 提出DiffPS框架，包含三个模块：扩散引导区域提议网络(DGRPN)用于改进行人定位，多尺度频率细化网络(MSFRN)缓解形状偏差，语义自适应特征聚合网络(SFAN)利用文本对齐的扩散特征。

Result: 在CUHK-SYSU和PRW数据集上达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 扩散先验知识能有效解决行人搜索中检测与重识别任务间的优化冲突，提出的三个专门模块显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped
scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained
backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on
CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

Motivation: 高光谱成像成本高且重建困难，现有压缩感知系统如CASSI虽提高效率，但重建仍面临严重退化和光谱细节丢失的挑战。

Method: 提出Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding网络(FMU)，在深度展开框架中嵌入流匹配的生成先验，并引入平均速度损失来增强流的全局一致性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，FMU在重建质量方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FMU成功结合了基于优化方法的可解释性和流匹配的生成能力，为HSI重建提供了更稳健准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

*Wei-Lung Mao,Chun-Chi Wang,Po-Heng Chou,Yen-Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的双列直插封装(DIP)自动缺陷检测系统，使用ConSinGAN生成缺陷图像解决数据不足问题，YOLOv7结合ConSinGAN在准确率和检测时间上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业组件缺陷检测耗时耗力，给质检人员带来沉重负担且难以管理产品质量。

Method: 使用数字相机光学和深度学习模型，针对DIP的表面缺陷和引脚缺陷，采用ConSinGAN生成训练数据集，比较YOLOv3、v4、v7、v9四种模型。

Result: YOLOv7结合ConSinGAN在准确率(95.50%)和检测时间(285ms)上表现最优，远超基于阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的自动缺陷检测系统可轻松应用于多种缺陷类型或缺陷数据不足的情况，并开发了SCADA系统及相关传感器架构。

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

*Guangyao Zhai,Yue Zhou,Xinyan Deng,Lars Heckler,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundAD是一个基于基础视觉编码器的少样本异常检测方法，通过学习非线性投影算子来识别图像中的异常区域，在参数更少的情况下实现多类别检测的竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业安全检测中，少样本异常检测面临样本有限导致正常与异常特征难以区分的挑战，特别是在类别不可知条件下。基础视觉编码器的大规模预训练有助于学习正常图像的一般分布。

Method: 通过观察图像中异常数量与学习嵌入差异的相关性，设计非线性投影算子投射到自然图像流形上，作为识别图像中分布外区域的有效工具。

Result: 广泛的实验表明该方法支持多类别检测，在使用显著更少参数的情况下实现了竞争性性能，并通过多个基础编码器（包括DINOv3）的评估验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法拓宽了对基础特征的理解视角，并推动了少样本异常检测领域的发展。

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ClustViT通过可训练的聚类模块和再生器模块优化Vision Transformer，在语义分割任务中显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer在真实机器人系统中应用受限，因为其二次注意力复杂度太高。现有token合并方法适合分类但不适合密集预测任务。

Method: 在ViT骨干网络中引入可训练的聚类模块，根据分割掩码的伪聚类指导合并相似token，然后通过再生器模块恢复细节信息。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上实现了2.18倍更少的GFLOPs和1.64倍更快的推理速度，同时保持可比较的分割精度。

Conclusion: ClustViT有效解决了ViT在密集预测任务中的计算效率问题，为实际机器人应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be
made publicly available.

TL;DR: PaDT是一种统一的多模态大语言模型范式，通过视觉参考令牌直接生成文本和多样化视觉输出，在视觉感知任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法依赖间接表示（如文本坐标），限制了性能并阻碍了分割等密集预测任务。

Method: 提出视觉参考令牌(VRTs)，从查询图像视觉补丁嵌入中提取，与LLM输出文本令牌交织，通过轻量解码器生成检测、分割和定位预测。

Result: 在四个视觉感知和理解任务中持续达到最先进性能，甚至优于显著更大的MLLM模型。

Conclusion: PaDT提供了一种统一的范式，使MLLM能够直接生成文本和视觉输出，在多种视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

TL;DR: 该论文构建了'信任金字塔'模型和'三角信任指数'，提出了可解释AI框架TriAlignXA来解决农产品电商中的信任缺失问题，通过多目标优化平衡质量、时效性和经济可行性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农产品电商中因无法直接感知产品质量而导致的'信任赤字'问题，传统绝对分级标准存在生物特性、时效性和经济可行性之间的'不可能三角'限制。

Method: 提出TriAlignXA可解释AI框架，包含三个引擎：生物自适应引擎（精细质量描述）、时效优化引擎（处理效率）、经济优化引擎（成本控制），以及'预映射机制'将过程数据编码为QR码透明传递质量信息。

Result: 在分级任务实验中，相比基线模型显著提高了准确性，实证证据和理论分析验证了框架在解决'不可能三角'方面的平衡能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建可信赖的在线农产品生态系统提供了从理论到实践的全面支持，建立了从算法决策到消费者信任的关键路径。

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

*Lei Liu,Can Wang,Zhenghao Chen,Dong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了4DGS-Craft框架，通过4D感知的InstructPix2Pix模型、多视图网格模块和Gaussian选择机制，解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的视图、时间和非编辑区域一致性问题，并利用LLM模块理解用户意图，实现更一致和可控的4D场景编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯溅射编辑方法在视图一致性、时间一致性、非编辑区域保持以及复杂文本指令处理方面存在挑战，需要开发一个能够同时解决这些问题的框架。

Method: 1. 引入4D感知InstructPix2Pix模型，整合4D VGGT几何特征；2. 使用多视图网格模块迭代优化多视图输入图像；3. 提出Gaussian选择机制保护非编辑区域；4. 设计基于LLM的用户意图理解模块，将复杂指令分解为原子操作序列。

Result: 相比相关工作，该方法能够实现更一致和可控的4D场景编辑，有效处理复杂用户指令，并在视图、时间和非编辑区域保持方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 4DGS-Craft框架通过结合4D几何感知、多视图一致性和智能指令分解，成功解决了4D高斯溅射编辑中的关键挑战，为4D场景编辑提供了更强大和用户友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

*Junyu Wu,Jie Tang,Jie Liu,Gangshan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Pure-Pass（PP）像素级掩码机制，通过固定颜色中心点识别纯像素并免除其昂贵计算，集成到ATD-light模型中实现高效超分辨率重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级超分辨率方法如CAMixer存在适应性差、掩码粒度粗和空间灵活性不足等问题，需要更精细的计算优化机制。

Method: Pure-Pass机制利用固定颜色中心点对像素进行分类，识别纯像素并免除其复杂计算，实现像素级精细掩码和空间灵活性。

Result: PP-ATD-light在保持相似计算节省量的情况下，在重建质量和参数效率方面均优于CAMixer-ATD-light。

Conclusion: Pure-Pass机制通过像素级掩码实现了高效超分辨率重建，在性能和效率上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4o多模态能力自动生成颌骨囊肿的影像学发现，通过自校正循环框架(SLSO)提高准确性，相比传统CoT方法在多个评估项目上表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态AI自动生成颌骨囊肿的影像学发现，提高诊断效率和准确性，解决传统方法中存在的幻觉问题和一致性不足。

Method: 构建自校正循环结构化输出(SLSO)框架，包含10步流程：图像输入分析、结构化数据生成、牙号提取与一致性检查、检测到不一致时迭代再生、发现生成与后续重构和一致性验证。

Result: SLSO框架在牙号、牙齿移动和牙根吸收三个项目上分别提高了66.9%、33.3%和28.6%的准确性，成功案例中最多经过5次再生后获得一致结构化输出。

Conclusion: SLSO框架能够强制阴性发现描述、抑制幻觉并提高牙号识别准确性，但识别跨多牙的大范围病变仍有限制，需要进一步改进以实现实用的发现生成系统。

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to
automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To
improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output
(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding
generation system.

Motivation: 开发一种仅依赖LiDAR点云的高效3D特征编码方法，在保持性能的同时减少资源消耗，适用于真实交通环境。

Method: 采用3D自编码器架构，减少编码器层数并简化跳跃连接，平衡跳跃连接信息与潜在编码，实现高效点云重建。

Result: 模型能够准确重建原始点云，在重建质量与性能之间取得良好平衡，并展现出对非交通环境对象的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LiLa-Net通过简化的架构设计实现了高效的点云特征编码和重建，具有良好的泛化性能和实际应用价值。

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which
encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the
LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,
equipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to
improve the performance without using extensive resources as the
state-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of
encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an
efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately
reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has
been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the
latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without
compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original
traffic environment.

Motivation: 传统野外观察方法范围有限、耗时费力，难以评估跨景观的行为响应，需要可扩展的方法来量化复杂多维行为模式。

Method: 整合无人机视频与机器学习系统，利用目标检测、跟踪和行为分类技术，提取行为、社交和空间指标。

Result: 相比地面方法，无人机观察显著改善行为粒度，减少15%可见性损失，更准确地捕捉行为转换。验证了969个行为序列，发现不同物种行为模式差异。

Conclusion: kabr-tools实现了规模化自动行为监测，为生态系统研究、保护和生态监测提供了强大工具。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖点云或需要预定义同胚映射来处理无纹理数据，存在局限性。本文旨在克服这些限制，实现更高质量的3D形状和纹理变形。

Method: 使用网格引导的3D高斯泼溅进行几何和外观建模，采用统一变形策略将3D高斯锚定到重建的网格面片上，通过拓扑感知约束保持纹理保真度，并利用网格拓扑作为几何先验建立无监督语义对应。

Result: 在TexMorph基准测试中，GaussianMorphing显著优于先前的2D/3D方法，颜色一致性误差(ΔE)降低22.2%，EI降低26.2%。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种集成方法，在变形过程中保持局部细节和全局语义一致性，无需标记数据，在3D形状和纹理变形方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于条件扩散模型的方法在不同用户间泛化能力差，主要因为位置测量高度受用户体型影响。

Method: 将姿态估计建模为逆问题，使用预训练扩散模型仅以旋转测量为条件，通过从测量位置导出的似然项引导生成过程。

Result: InPose方法能够零样本泛化到不同用户，生成符合稀疏体感测量的高概率姿态序列。

Conclusion: 提出的逆问题公式和算法实现了跨用户的零样本泛化，解决了位置测量对体型敏感的问题。

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Motivation: 传统卷积架构如U-Net在捕捉长距离依赖关系方面有限，限制了在复杂肿瘤结构上的性能。扩散模型在医学图像生成和边界细化方面显示出潜力。

Method: 在扩散过程核心嵌入视觉Transformer，利用全局上下文推理和迭代去噪，结合Transformer的空间关系建模能力和扩散模型的细化能力。

Result: 在MRI脑肿瘤数据集上的实验验证显示，在Dice相似度和Hausdorff距离指标上取得一致提升。

Conclusion: Transformer引导的扩散模型有潜力推进肿瘤分割技术发展，超越传统U-Net基准，提供更好的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

*Woowon Jang,Jiwon Im,Juseung Choi,Niki Rashidian,Wesley De Neve,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中点跟踪方法的失败模式，发现点跟踪对于手术工具表现良好，但对于解剖目标（如胆囊）由于组织相似性和边界模糊而表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点跟踪在手术视频分析中提供了一种高效低成本的替代方案，但其在复杂手术环境中的可靠性和失败情况尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 在腹腔镜胆囊切除术视频中，针对胆囊、抓钳和L型电钩三个手术目标，比较了点跟踪与分割掩码初始化的性能。

Result: 点跟踪对于手术工具具有竞争力，但对于解剖目标表现不佳，主要由于组织相似性和边界模糊导致失败。

Conclusion: 通过定性分析揭示了影响跟踪结果的关键因素，并提供了选择与放置跟踪点的实用建议，以改善手术视频分析性能。

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot
tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the
available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost
alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical
environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze
the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

*Ding-Ruei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FFREEDG新任务：在服务器预训练后，仅使用客户端的未标注数据进行联邦学习，不再访问源数据。提出了FRIEREN框架，利用视觉基础模型和语言模态来解决这一挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在语义分割任务中面临域偏移挑战，特别是当客户端数据未标注时。现有方法要么不切实际地假设客户端有标注数据，要么未能充分利用现代视觉基础模型的能力。

Method: 使用视觉-语言解码器，基于CLIP文本嵌入来改善语义消歧；采用弱到强一致性学习策略，在伪标签上进行鲁棒的本地训练。

Result: 在合成到真实、清晰到恶劣天气的基准测试中，该框架有效解决了新任务，性能与现有域泛化和适应方法相当，为未来研究建立了强基线。

Conclusion: FRIEREN框架成功解决了FFREEDG这一具有挑战性的任务，展示了利用视觉基础模型和语言模态在联邦学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for
future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASK-Hint是一个基于动作知识的提示框架，通过细粒度引导问题提升冻结视觉语言模型在视频异常检测中的性能，在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示方法过于抽象，忽略了定义复杂异常所需的人类-物体交互或动作语义等细粒度信息。

Method: 将提示组织成语义连贯的组别（如暴力、财产犯罪、公共安全），并制定细粒度引导问题，使模型预测与判别性视觉线索对齐。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上，ASK-Hint持续提升AUC，相比现有基准方法达到最先进性能，并展示了跨数据集和VLM骨干网络的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提示的细粒度对性能至关重要，ASK-Hint为可解释视频异常检测提供了一个无需训练且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language
models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are
often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions
or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We
propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages
action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning
from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent
groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free
methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces
towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM
backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and
establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for
explainable video anomaly detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoPurify通过学生亲和网络和几何引导池化模块，利用3D自监督教师模型提取的几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征，有效解决了2D到3D特征转移中的噪声和几何不一致问题，仅需1.5%训练数据即可达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将2D视觉语言模型特征转移到3D语义分割时面临权衡：直接投影会产生噪声预测，而强制几何一致性需要昂贵训练流程。作者认为问题源于分割-匹配范式未能协调2D语义与3D几何结构。

Method: 提出GeoPurify方法：使用小型学生亲和网络，利用3D自监督教师模型提取的几何先验来净化2D VLM生成的3D点特征；在推理时设计几何引导池化模块进一步去噪并确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在主要3D基准测试上的广泛实验表明，GeoPurify达到或超越了最先进性能，同时仅使用了约1.5%的训练数据。

Conclusion: GeoPurify通过利用潜在几何信息和学习的亲和网络，有效缓解了2D到3D特征转移的权衡问题，实现了卓越的数据效率。

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于猪耳静脉模式的非侵入性生物识别方法，使用智能手机采集图像，通过多阶段计算机视觉流程和机器学习模型实现98.12%的识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统猪只识别方法（如耳标、芯片）不可靠、成本高且主要针对纯种猪，不适合小规模养殖户。需要开发低成本、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 收集20头混种猪的800张耳部图像，使用标准智能手机和简单背光拍摄。开发多阶段计算机视觉流程增强静脉可见性，提取结构和空间特征生成生物特征签名，使用机器学习模型进行分类。

Result: 支持向量机（SVM）在混种猪群中达到98.12%的识别精度，从图像处理到分类平均耗时8.3秒，适合实时农场部署。

Conclusion: 该系统通过永久性生物标记替代易损的物理标识，为农民提供经济有效、无压力的动物识别方法，证实了耳静脉生物识别在数字化畜牧管理中的实用性。

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural
communities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集和遮挡场景中，离散的检测计数方法失效，需要密度图估计来准确计数多类别对象。

Method: 采用Twins金字塔视觉变换器作为主干，构建多类别计数头，结合多尺度解码方法，添加基于分割的类别聚焦模块来抑制训练时的类别间干扰。

Result: 在VisDrone和iSAID基准测试中表现优于现有多类别人群计数方法，MAE分别降低33%、43%和64%，在密集场景中比YOLOv11更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过区域损失将多类别人群计数扩展到新领域，应用于生物多样性监测数据集，展示了其在保护工作和可扩展生态洞察方面的潜力。

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

TL;DR: TempoControl是一种无需重新训练或额外监督的方法，通过优化交叉注意力图来实现视频生成中的时间对齐控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成视频模型缺乏细粒度的时间控制，无法让用户指定视觉元素在生成序列中的出现时间。

Method: 利用文本到视频扩散模型中的交叉注意力图，通过相关性、能量和熵三个互补原则来引导概念的时间安排。

Result: TempoControl能够在确保高质量和多样性的同时，实现对时间的精确控制，适用于多种视频生成应用。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了视频生成中的时间对齐问题，为细粒度时间控制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RewardMap多阶段强化学习框架，通过密集奖励设计和从简单感知到复杂推理的多阶段训练策略，解决多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉推理任务中的稀疏奖励和不稳定优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在结构化信息丰富场景（如交通地图）中的空间推理能力不足，而标准强化学习因稀疏奖励和优化不稳定而受阻。

Method: 构建ReasonMap-Plus数据集提供密集奖励信号，提出RewardMap多阶段RL框架，包含难度感知奖励设计和从感知到推理的多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在ReasonMap和ReasonMap-Plus上的实验显示RewardMap各组件均带来性能提升，组合使用效果最佳，在6个基准测试上平均提升3.47%。

Conclusion: RewardMap有效提升了MLLMs的视觉理解和推理能力，证明了密集奖励和多阶段训练策略在细粒度视觉推理任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DragFlow是首个利用FLUX强大先验进行拖拽式图像编辑的框架，通过区域级编辑范式和仿射变换解决了DiT特征结构化不足的问题，在拖拽编辑任务上超越了现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型从UNet-based DDPMs转向更可扩展的DiT with flow matching（如SD3.5、FLUX），生成先验显著增强，但拖拽式编辑尚未从中受益。现有方法在目标区域存在严重失真，因为早期基础模型的先验不足以将优化后的潜在表示投影回自然图像流形。

Method: 1. 引入区域级编辑范式，使用仿射变换提供更丰富一致的特征监督；2. 集成预训练的开域个性化适配器（如IP-Adapter）增强主体一致性；3. 通过基于梯度掩码的硬约束保持背景保真度；4. 使用多模态大语言模型解决任务歧义性。

Result: 在DragBench-DR和ReD Bench上的广泛实验表明，DragFlow超越了基于点和基于区域的基线方法，在拖拽式图像编辑任务上达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: DragFlow成功利用FLUX的丰富先验进行拖拽式编辑，通过区域级方法解决了DiT特征结构化不足的问题，为拖拽编辑任务设定了新的技术标准。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了F2C方法，通过选择关键片段而非孤立关键帧来保持视频的时间连贯性，同时采用自适应分辨率策略在固定计算预算下平衡空间分辨率和片段长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型面临"大海捞针"问题：原始视频帧产生的大量视觉标记耗尽模型上下文窗口。现有解决方案通过选择稀疏帧集来减少标记数量，但这种逐帧选择丢弃了基本的时间动态，导致对运动和事件连续性的推理不理想。

Method: 提出F2C方法：1）将选择从孤立关键帧扩展到关键片段（短时间相干段）；2）采用自适应分辨率策略，动态平衡空间分辨率和片段长度，确保每个视频的标记数量恒定。

Result: 在三个长视频基准测试上的实验表明，这种无需训练的方法在Video-MME、LongVideoBench和MLVU基准上分别比均匀采样高出8.1%、5.6%和10.3%。

Conclusion: 结果强调了在帧选择中保持时间连贯性的重要性，并为将视频LLM扩展到实际视频理解应用提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Result: MotionAGFormer表现最优，总体RMSE为9.27°±4.80°，MAE为7.86°±4.18°，Pearson相关性0.86±0.15，决定系数R²为0.67±0.28。两种技术都可行，但各有优缺点。

Conclusion: 研究阐明了现成视频模型在健康成人中提供临床前景运动学的位置，以及它们落后于IMU估计的位置，为开发远程医疗和远程患者监测的稳健、成本效益高且用户友好的解决方案提供了宝贵指南。

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Conclusion: NeuroSwift通过创新的适配器集成和参数高效微调策略，成功解决了跨被试视觉重建的挑战，实现了高效且准确的性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Result: 在13个细粒度基准测试中平均准确率提升2.90%，仅需轻量级适配。

Conclusion: microCLIP能够有效挖掘CLIP中的潜在细粒度信号，显著提升细粒度分类性能，同时保持轻量适配需求。

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

TL;DR: VidGuard-R1是首个通过多模态大语言模型和群体相对策略优化实现视频真伪检测的系统，提供高精度判断和可解释推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成视频快速发展，需要有效的检测工具来应对错误信息和声誉损害等社会风险，同时确保检测模型提供可解释性以增强透明度。

Method: 使用群体相对策略优化(GRPO)微调多模态大语言模型(Qwen-VL)，构建包含14万真实和AI生成视频的挑战性数据集，并设计专门针对时间伪影和生成复杂度的奖励模型。

Result: 在现有基准测试中实现最先进的零样本性能，额外训练后准确率超过95%，案例研究显示能产生精确且可解释的预测理由。

Conclusion: VidGuard-R1通过结合准确分类和可解释推理，为视频真伪检测提供了有效的解决方案，代码已公开。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need
for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation
and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential
that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency
for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce
VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出一种简单有效的方法来缓解长视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需长视频教师监督或重新训练长视频数据集，通过利用教师模型的丰富知识为学生模型提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和视频生成方面取得了革命性进展，但基于transformer架构的计算成本过高，特别是在生成长视频时。现有的自回归方法在超出训练范围时会出现明显的质量退化问题。

Method: 利用教师模型的丰富知识，通过从自生成长视频中抽取片段为学生模型提供指导，保持时间一致性，避免过曝光和误差累积问题。

Result: 方法能够将视频长度扩展到教师模型能力的20倍，生成最长4分15秒的视频，相当于基础模型位置嵌入支持的最大跨度的99.9%，比基线模型长50多倍。在标准基准测试中，在保真度和一致性方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长视频生成中的质量退化问题，无需额外监督或重新训练，在保持时间一致性的同时显著扩展了视频生成长度。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在物理交互方面存在不足，缺乏物理基础的控制机制，限制了其在机器人学和决策模拟中的应用潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略，通过物体掩码逐步移除未来运动监督，在合成场景上训练视频扩散模型，并结合低级运动控制与高级文本条件。

Result: 在真实场景中显著改善了物体交互效果，相比同类模型有显著提升，消融研究验证了低级和高级条件的互补作用。

Conclusion: KineMask通过物理引导的视频生成方法，成功实现了更逼真的物体交互和控制，为复杂动力学现象合成提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Conclusion: 多模态感官整合能够有效实现精细控制，为机器人精细交互提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型受限于上下文长度，容易错过关键过渡帧，难以在长时间尺度上保持连贯性。

Method: 采用硬件感知的混合注意力方法：文本使用密集注意力，视频使用原生稀疏注意力(NSA)，通过端到端训练在216K视频指令数据集上适配Qwen2.5-VL。

Result: 相比令牌压缩和无训练稀疏基线，VideoNSA在长视频理解、时序推理和空间基准测试中表现更优，可靠扩展到128K令牌。

Conclusion: VideoNSA成功解决了视频理解中的上下文长度限制，通过混合注意力策略实现了高效的长视频处理，并发现了全局-局部注意力分配、任务依赖分支使用等关键模式。

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context
length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain
coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse
Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts
Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We
employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense
attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to
token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention
allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4)
the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

TL;DR: NoiseShift是一种无需训练的方法，通过根据分辨率大小重新校准降噪器的噪声水平，解决了扩散模型在不同分辨率下生成质量不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高分辨率文本到图像生成器无法为不需要高分辨率图像的用户提供开箱即用的预算友好替代方案，因为模型在训练分辨率之外的泛化能力较差。

Method: 提出NoiseShift方法，识别噪声调度器在不同分辨率下具有不等的感知效果，通过重新校准降噪器的噪声水平来缓解训练-测试不匹配问题。

Result: 在LAION-COCO数据集上，NoiseShift将SD3.5的FID提高了15.89%，SD3提高了8.56%，Flux-Dev提高了2.44%；在CelebA数据集上，分别提高了10.36%、5.19%和3.02%。

Conclusion: NoiseShift能有效缓解分辨率相关的伪影，提升低分辨率图像生成质量，且无需修改模型架构或采样计划，与现有模型兼容。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: 该论文研究从视频预测动态物理属性的任务，包括弹性、粘度和动态摩擦，通过构建新数据集并探索三种推断方法：基于经典计算机视觉的oracle方法、使用视觉提示的预训练视频模型方法以及多模态大语言模型方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何从视频中推断需要时间信息才能判断的动态物理属性，如物体的弹性、液体的粘度和表面的动态摩擦系数。

Method: 收集了三个物理属性的新视频数据集；探索了三种推断方法：(a) 使用经典计算机视觉技术的oracle方法；(b) 使用视觉提示和可训练提示向量在预训练视频生成和自监督模型上进行交叉注意力的方法；(c) 多模态大语言模型的提示策略。

Result: 生成式或自监督预训练的视频基础模型表现相似，但落后于oracle方法；多模态大语言模型目前表现较差，但通过合适的提示可以改善性能。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在动态物理属性预测任务上表现良好但不及oracle方法，多模态大语言模型仍有改进空间，合适的提示策略能提升其性能。

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More
specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information
to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,
and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make
the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Conclusion: 提出的对象感知框架能够有效链接声音与直接涉及的物体，在声音对象检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor
versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to
the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to
evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly
involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework
learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric
approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks
of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the
most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is
used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art
performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding
tasks.

Motivation: 随着NeRF和3DGS等3D场景表示方法的普及，解决其安全漏洞变得至关重要。本文旨在分析3DGS对图像级投毒攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用核密度估计(KDE)识别低密度区域，策略性地注入高斯点嵌入视角依赖的虚假物体；引入自适应噪声策略破坏多视角一致性；提出基于KDE的评估协议。

Result: 广泛实验表明该方法在攻击效果上优于现有技术，能够有效嵌入可见的虚假物体同时最小化对无辜视角的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了3DGS对投毒攻击的脆弱性，提出的评估协议为未来研究提供了客观基准。

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As
these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes
critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and
propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically
injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly
visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view
consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based
evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling
objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate
our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在单主体提示上表现良好，但在多主体描述中经常出现属性泄漏、身份纠缠和主体遗漏等问题，需要专门的方法来提升多主体生成质量。

Method: 通过随机最优控制视角分析流匹配，提出两种架构无关算法：无训练测试时控制器和轻量级微调规则Adjoint Matching，并开发了FOCUS方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多主体保真度提供了首个专门的微调路径，FOCUS方法在多个模型上实现了最先进的多主体生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with
multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity
entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical
framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

Abstract: We introduce a dataset of concept learning tasks that helps uncover implicit
biases in large language models. Using in-context concept learning experiments,
we found that language models may have a bias toward upward monotonicity in
quantifiers; such bias is less apparent when the model is tested by direct
prompting without concept learning components. This demonstrates that
in-context concept learning can be an effective way to discover hidden biases
in language models.

Conclusion: 呼吁从提取式数据收集转向参与式、共适应的学习过程，尊重并赋能社区，同时发现和保护世界语言多样性，这符合以人为中心AI的原则。

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains
fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized
orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in
large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain
inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive,
pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we
argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery,
where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than
static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology,
particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond
static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven
discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration
instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework
grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty
from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers
to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a
call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge
in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward
participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower
communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity.
This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing
interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate
climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their
value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure
maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs)
fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment,
specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from
sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as
emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights:
(1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but
quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2)
larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than
peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread
similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing
differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of
LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect
commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

Method: 使用标准化的兽医肿瘤学记录数据集，通过基于评分标准的LLM作为评判者框架，对三种兽医专用LLM总结工具在五个维度（事实准确性、完整性、时间顺序、临床相关性和组织性）进行评分。

Result: Product 1表现最佳，中位平均得分4.61，在事实准确性和时间顺序方面获得完美中位分数；LLM评判者表现出高可重复性，平均得分标准差分别为0.015、0.088和0.034。

Conclusion: 兽医专用商业LLM工具的重要性得到证实，LLM作为评判者的评估方法在兽医医学临床NLP总结评估中具有可扩展性和可重复性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet
their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated
three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools
(Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of
veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework,
summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness,
Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved
the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR:
0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for
Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and
Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading
framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The
LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard
deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).
These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM
tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and
reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary
medicine.

*Akshith Reddy Putta,Jacob Devasier,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimCheck是一个基于小语言模型的自动事实核查系统，通过模块化流程实现高效的事实核查，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越了使用更大模型的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事实核查系统依赖大型闭源模型和静态知识库，计算成本高且不透明。需要开发更高效、透明的事实核查方法。

Method: 采用模块化验证流程：网络搜索查询规划、基于网络的证据检索和总结、证据合成和重新检索、声明裁决评估。每个模块针对小语言模型优化。

Result: 使用仅4B参数的Qwen3模型，在AVeriTeC数据集上达到76.4%的准确率，超越了使用LLaMA3.1 70B和GPT-4o的先前方法。

Conclusion: 精心设计的模块化架构和提示策略可以克服小语言模型的限制，实现高效、准确的事实核查，为透明AI系统开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system
designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language
models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and
static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise
verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of
Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization,
evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module
is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and
interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational
requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming
previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations
demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome
the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we
provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

*Nicole N Khatibi,Daniil A. Radamovich,Michael P. Brenner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文质疑当前数学基准测试对LLM推理能力的评估，指出现有基准可能因数据污染和问题类型单一而高估模型能力，并提出了新的EEFSUVA基准来更全面评估数学推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于IMO等竞赛的数学基准可能因数据污染和问题类型单一而高估LLM的数学推理能力，需要更全面的评估数据集。

Method: 引入EEFSUVA基准，该基准收集自东欧和前苏联国家的地区性和国家级奥赛题目，这些题目难度与IMO相当但使用非标准解题技巧，且在在线语料库中较少出现。

Result: 初步结果显示，即使最先进的LLM在EEFSUVA基准上的表现也明显低于其他奥赛风格基准。

Conclusion: 需要更广泛的评估数据集来全面评估数学推理能力，并为未来模型开发提供指导。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs)
match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics
benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the
extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning.
The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International
Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models
reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on
familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical
understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under
circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries
from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable
difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard
problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online
corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a
notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style
benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader
evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for
guiding future model development.

### [84] [Who is In Charge? Dissecting Role Conflicts in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01228)
*Siqi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs在遵循分层指令时存在脆弱性，系统提示容易被忽略，而社会线索（如权威、共识）则被强烈遵守。机制分析显示冲突检测信号早期编码，但只有社会冲突能一致解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型应该遵循分层指令（系统提示优先于用户输入），但现有研究表明它们经常忽略这一规则，反而强烈服从社会线索如权威或共识。需要理解这种现象的机制原因。

Method: 使用线性探测分析冲突决策信号的编码位置，通过直接对数归因揭示内部冲突检测强度，并进行向量引导实验来测试指令遵循的增强效果。

Result: 系统-用户冲突和社会冲突形成不同的子空间；系统-用户冲突检测更强但解决不一致；社会线索能一致解决冲突；引导向量意外地以角色无关方式增强指令遵循。

Conclusion: 这些结果解释了系统服从的脆弱性，并强调了需要轻量级、层次敏感的校准方法来改善LLMs的分层指令遵循能力。

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system
prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule
while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend
these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale
dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with
system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit
Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases
but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that,
despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction
following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile
system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive
alignment methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种无需人工标注的文档重排序方法，使用LLM生成合成查询并标注正负样本对，然后通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型，在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在文档重排序方面表现优异但计算成本高，而微调小型模型需要稀缺的人工标注数据，因此需要一种无需人工标注的高效解决方案。

Method: 使用LLM从领域语料生成合成查询，通过LLM分类器标注正负样本对，然后使用LCE损失函数通过对比学习微调小型transformer模型。

Result: 在MedQuAD数据集上，该方法显著提升了领域内性能，并在跨领域任务中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将LLM用于数据生成和监督而非推理，可以在降低计算成本的同时保持强大的重排序能力，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance
across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high
computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments.
Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but
typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we
propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled
query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from
domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive
and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a
smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive
Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our
approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to
out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather
than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong
reranking capabilities.

TL;DR: 使用PHATE流形分析研究汉字嵌入的几何模式，发现实词呈现聚类模式，虚词呈现分支模式，几何复杂度与语义内容相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统研究汉字嵌入中的几何模式，为传统语言学理论提供计算证据，建立语义组织的几何分析框架。

Method: 使用PHATE流形分析，交叉验证7个嵌入模型和8个降维方法，分析1000多个汉字在12个语义域中的分布，进行123个短语的子网络分析。

Result: 实词呈现聚类模式，虚词呈现分支模式；有意义的字符显示丰富的几何多样性，结构部首坍缩成紧密簇；子网络分析显示从基本字符到短语的系统性语义扩展。

Conclusion: 几何复杂度与语义内容相关，为传统语言学理论提供了计算证据，建立了语义组织几何分析的新框架。

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character
embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven
embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe
clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function
words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains
reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful
characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse
into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases)
demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These
findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic
theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic
organization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信息过载和高风险决策需求下的自动摘要可靠性问题，避免过度自信的预测

Method: 构建基于条件生成的摘要模型，引入贝叶斯推理建模参数空间不确定性，使用预测分布熵测量不确定性，结合熵正则化和风险感知损失进行联合优化，并加入风险评分和调节模块

Result: 比较实验和敏感性分析验证该方法显著提高了高风险应用中摘要的鲁棒性和可靠性，同时保持了流畅性和语义完整性

Conclusion: 为可信摘要提供了系统性解决方案，在方法论层面展示了可扩展性和实用价值

Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk
scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates
uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands
of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional
generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is
introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which
helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated
content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint
optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure
that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed
during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk
scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content
accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts.
Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed
method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization
in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.
This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and
demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

*Dongjun Kim,Gyuho Shim,Yongchan Chun,Minhyuk Kim,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Benchmark Profiling框架，通过分解基准测试性能为10种认知能力，揭示基准测试实际测量的能力组合，解释了为什么性能提升不总是转化为用户感知的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试分数往往高估真实能力，因为掩盖了任务实际需要的技能组合，缺乏系统方法来验证基准测试是否真正测量其声称的能力标签。

Method: 结合基于梯度的重要性评分和针对性参数消融，计算Ability Impact Score (AIS)来量化每种能力对基准测试成功的贡献程度。

Result: 分析发现：大多数基准测试依赖多种能力而非单一能力；相似标签的数据集依赖不同的能力组合；代码生成基准奖励广泛的多技能改进；无关能力可能负面影响性能。

Conclusion: Benchmark Profiling解释了性能提升与用户感知能力之间的差距，为基准测试审计和模型可解释性提供了透明工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard
benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the
mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test
reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we
lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these
labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that
decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The
method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter
ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each
ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three
instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key
findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii)
datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii)
code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show
only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities
irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling
therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into
user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and
model interpretability.

Abstract: This research presents a computational social science approach to preserving
Telugu Chandassu, the metrical poetry tradition representing centuries of
collective cultural intelligence. We develop the first comprehensive digital
framework for analyzing Telugu prosodic patterns, bridging traditional
community knowledge with modern computational methods. Our social computing
approach involves collaborative dataset creation of 4,651 annotated padyams,
expert-validated linguistic patterns, and culturally-informed algorithmic
design. The framework includes AksharamTokenizer for prosody-aware
tokenization, LaghuvuGuruvu Generator for classifying light and heavy
syllables, and PadyaBhedam Checker for automated pattern recognition. Our
algorithm achieves 91.73% accuracy on the proposed Chandassu Score, with
evaluation metrics reflecting traditional literary standards. This work
demonstrates how computational social science can preserve endangered cultural
knowledge systems while enabling new forms of collective intelligence around
literary heritage. The methodology offers insights for community-centered
approaches to cultural preservation, supporting broader initiatives in digital
humanities and socially-aware computing systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMRank是一个提示感知的路由框架，通过提取任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标等人类可读特征，使用神经排序模型预测每个模型对特定提示的效用，实现LLM的智能选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型部署中的关键挑战：如何在多样化的模型能力、延迟和计算成本之间权衡，为每个提示选择最合适的模型以优化性能与效率。

Method: 提出LLMRank框架，从提示中提取多维度特征（任务类型、推理模式、复杂度指标、语法线索等），结合轻量级代理求解器的信号，使用神经排序模型预测模型效用，在包含36,497个提示的RouterBench数据集上训练。

Result: 达到89.2%的oracle效用，同时提供可解释的特征归因来解释路由决策。研究表明多维度特征提取和混合排序目标的重要性。

Conclusion: 特征驱动的路由方法为高效和透明的LLM部署提供了潜力，强调可解释性在模型选择中的价值。

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities,
latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge:
selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off
between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware
routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from
prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators,
syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior
one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts
per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench,
comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs,
from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up
to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions
that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of
multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting
the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了DermIQ-VLM，一种通过多阶段资源高效方法开发的视觉语言模型，旨在模拟皮肤科医生的诊断过程。主要贡献是GRPO++，改进了GRPO框架的稳定性，并结合DPO进行知识对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在医学图像分析中面临的数据稀缺和计算成本高的问题，特别是在皮肤科等复杂领域中结构化推理能力有限的问题。

Method: 采用多阶段训练流程：首先使用GRPO++进行疾病识别推理，然后进行监督微调以增强对话能力，最后使用基于知识图的DPO进行事实对齐。

Result: 在精心策划的皮肤科数据集上的初步评估显示，该方法相比标准微调方法取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 验证了该流程作为在资源受限环境中开发专业化、可靠视觉语言模型的可行途径。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet
their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is
often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced
training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a
VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to
emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a
modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++,
which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed
training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease
recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To
mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based
system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a
curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology
yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These
findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for
developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于置信度感知的路由系统，在生成前评估模型不确定性，根据可靠性估计重定向查询，显著减少幻觉并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型存在幻觉问题，生成看似合理但事实错误的内容。现有后生成修正方法计算成本高且无法防止不可靠内容生成

Method: 结合三种互补信号：内部表示与参考嵌入的语义对齐、跨模型层的内部收敛分析、学习置信度估计，统一置信度分数决定四种路由路径

Result: 在知识密集型QA基准测试中，幻觉检测显著改善(0.74 vs 0.42基线)，计算成本降低40%，F1分数从0.61提升至0.82，假阳性率低(0.09)

Conclusion: 从反应性修正转向主动评估的范式转变，为LLM可靠性增强提供了计算效率高的方法

Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet
factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on
post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to
prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing
system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and
redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three
complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and
reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and
learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing
to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented
generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human
review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks
demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42
baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc
methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates
(0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment
offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

TL;DR: 研究发现填充标记在LLMs中并非无害，即使少量填充也会影响激活表示、降低生成质量、改变偏见并削弱安全防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填充标记在LLMs批处理推理中被广泛使用，但实现错误可能导致其影响计算，这种影响程度尚未被充分理解。

Method: 系统研究三种开源模型家族(Llama、Gemma、Qwen)，插入受控数量的填充，并沿四个维度评估结果：激活、生成质量、偏见和安全性。

Result: 即使少量填充也会改变隐藏表示，在较小模型中降低生成质量，以不可预测的方式改变偏见，并削弱安全护栏。

Conclusion: 填充不是无害的细节，而是部署中必须仔细处理的鲁棒性风险。

Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize
sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked,
implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent
of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect
across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting
controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes:
activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of
padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter
bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings
demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that
must be carefully handled in deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CIFLEX是一种新颖的执行系统，通过重用主任务的KV缓存和注入特定任务指令到隔离的侧路径，显著减少多轮交互中子任务处理的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM能力增强，单个模型需要处理多样化的子任务来全面支持用户请求，但传统方法在切换主任务和子任务时需要重新处理整个对话上下文，产生大量计算开销。

Method: 重用主任务的KV缓存，将任务特定指令注入到隔离的侧路径中，子任务执行后通过缓存上下文回滚到主路径，避免冗余的预填充计算，并采用分层分类策略支持子任务选择。

Result: 实验表明CIFLEX显著降低了计算成本，同时不降低任务性能，实现了可扩展和高效的设备端多任务对话。

Conclusion: CIFLEX通过创新的上下文指令流和KV缓存重用机制，为设备端LLM提供了高效的多任务执行解决方案。

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which
is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn
interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become
increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks
that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests.
Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching
between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring
significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing
the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific
instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model
rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant
prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a
hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models,
decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that
CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task
performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Motivation: 当前LLM在公开数学套件上表现强劲，但数学前沿研究存在天花板效应，需要更难的推理中心化基准来评估数学推理能力。

Method: 创建了两个基准：1）100项结构化诊断集，包含长度、数值密度和符号复杂度等元数据；2）150项竞赛式套件，涵盖从高中到博士四个阶段的七个学科分类。在单一设置下评估了15个当代LLM变体。

Result: 在竞赛套件中，最强模型达到44%准确率，次优模型为37%；从高中到博士阶段准确率下降，顶级系统的博士到高中保留率接近79%。在推理集中，最佳模型总体达到81%，最难部分结果揭示了领先者与中游模型之间的明显稳健性差距。

Conclusion: SKYLENAGE提供了一个难度校准、元数据丰富的困难推理中心化数学基准，可作为未来数学推理评估的参考基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites,
yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling
effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a
100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length,
numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item
contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a
seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a
single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the
contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%;
accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a
doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best
model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness

### [96] [Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242)

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but
through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models,
semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions,
while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers
tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this
phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled,
entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall
behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and
monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable
across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the
score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the
penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly
estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0),
yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day
bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent
interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled
both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical
minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset,
the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic
continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory
aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded,
task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in
artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von
Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy,
and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出了ARGRE框架，通过建模毒性转换轨迹和自回归奖励模型，实现精确的LLM去毒化，显著降低毒性同时保持模型能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时去毒方法因对毒性-非毒性转换空间探索不足，导致干预不精确，需要更稳定精确的去毒策略

Method: ARGRE框架：识别非毒性语义方向，在潜在表示空间插值揭示细粒度转换轨迹，构建自回归奖励模型指导自适应两步编辑过程

Result: 在8个LLM上实验显示，毒性降低62.21%，推理时间减少47.58%，同时最小化原始模型能力退化

Conclusion: ARGRE通过显式建模毒性转换和稳定奖励指导，实现了高效精确的LLM去毒化，为安全部署提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content,
necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible
deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static
or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution
due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches
often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient
exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To
address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward
\textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel
test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions
within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise
reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and
interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained
transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity
annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an
autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance.
At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to
obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based
on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions,
followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments
across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading
baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference
time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with
minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

TL;DR: 开发了一个心理健康压力本体论（MeSO），并使用大型语言模型从文本中提取结构化压力信息，准确率达到78.2%，证明了本体论引导的LLM在压力信息提取中的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的压力信息通常以非结构化自由文本形式存在，难以有效利用。环境AI技术虽然能减轻文档负担，但主要生成非结构化叙述，限制了临床实用性。

Method: 开发心理健康压力本体论（MeSO），整合理论模型和11个验证过的压力评估工具的概念。使用Claude Sonnet 4从35个Reddit帖子中提取六类压力相关信息，并由人工评估准确性。

Result: 最终本体论包含8个顶级类别的181个概念。在220个可提取的压力相关项目中，LLM正确识别172个（78.2%），错误分类27个（12.3%），遗漏21个（9.5%）。所有正确提取的项目都能准确映射到MeSO。

Conclusion: 研究表明使用本体论引导的LLM进行结构化压力信息提取是可行的，有潜力提高环境AI系统中压力文档的一致性和实用性。未来工作应涉及临床对话数据和跨LLM比较。

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors,
individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses,
significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently
documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health
records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation
burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream
clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the
feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided
stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology
(MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional
Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's
structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert
validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress
response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were
extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated
accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across
eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM
correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21
(9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although
24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for
structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to
enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI
systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison
across LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时空模型难以利用描述外部事件的文本信息来预测人类移动性的突然变化。

Method: 使用基于LLM的多智能体框架自动从复杂在线文本中提取和推理时空相关信息，通过渐进融合架构将细粒度上下文与时空数据结合。

Result: 在构建的数据集上评估，SeMob相比时空模型在MAE和RMSE上分别最大降低了13.92%和11.12%，在事件发生时空区域表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: SeMob框架通过利用丰富的预训练事件先验知识，显著提升了事件驱动的移动性预测准确性。

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to
account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models
struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose
SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility
prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based
agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text
from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated
with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion
architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights
about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting
model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves
maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the
spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority
especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time
of occurrence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用稀疏自编码器（SAE）的top-1潜在特征进行语言模型引导，解决了top-k方法中非语义特征干扰的问题，并引入token-wise衰减引导策略避免退化输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有top-k SAE引导方法存在非语义特征（如标点符号）干扰，且恒定引导会产生退化输出（如重复单词），需要更精确的引导方法。

Method: 采用top-1 SAE潜在特征进行引导，结合token-wise衰减策略，使引导强度随时间衰减以避免输出退化。

Result: 实验表明，引导与推理相关的SAE潜在特征能可靠地引发逐步数学推理，在数学推理基准上优于均值激活差方法，在IF-Eval上表现相当。

Conclusion: SAE引导方法能有效提升语言模型的推理能力，功能上类似于添加引导token，为模型控制提供了新途径。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for
steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture
non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like
instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant
SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a
limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs
such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise
decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean
activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE
latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical
reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of
appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean
activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match
their performance on IF-Eval.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports,
often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this
gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess
LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents,
encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of
which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and
scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot,
and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language
Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural
sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for
assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

TL;DR: 提出SSTAG方法，通过文本作为统一表示媒介，结合LLM的语义推理和GNN的结构建模能力，解决图学习中的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图学习模型通常针对单个图数据集训练，缺乏跨图和跨任务的泛化能力，且依赖大量标注数据。与NLP和CV不同，图数据具有异构性和结构多样性，需要新的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出结构感知的自监督学习方法SSTAG，使用双重知识蒸馏框架将LLM和GNN共同蒸馏到结构感知的MLP中，并引入内存机制存储典型图表示以整合不变知识。

Result: 实验表明SSTAG在跨域迁移学习任务中优于最先进模型，具有出色的可扩展性，同时降低推理成本并保持竞争力。

Conclusion: SSTAG成功弥合了LLM语义推理与GNN结构建模之间的差距，为大规模文本属性图的跨域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain
generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically
trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer
knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies
on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in
resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data
presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain
specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised
learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a
unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between
the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural
modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces
a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs
into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability
of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that
stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an
in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the
model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG
outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks,
achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining
competitive performance.

Motivation: 现有科学问答数据集错误率高，主要由于答案中存在逻辑跳跃和隐含推理，影响科学AI的可靠性。

Method: LOCA采用增强-审查循环框架，通过补全缺失逻辑步骤、分离科学原理与推导过程来增强原始答案。

Result: 在挑战性科学语料库上应用LOCA，能自动过滤噪声数据集，将错误率从20%降至2%以下。

Conclusion: LOCA为创建高质量科学语料库提供了可扩展的有效方法，有助于更可靠地训练和评估科学AI。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their
reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of
scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing
scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates,
frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the
answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation),
a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented
through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by
completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying
scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to
challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter
noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below
2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating
high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and
evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant
to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for
moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission
to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites
toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically
diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual
transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting
techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus
combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated
synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At
inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and
explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy,
LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first
on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score
increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA
analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of
performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单次LLM输出的自监督不确定性估计方法，用于表格数据实体链接任务，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在实体链接任务中需要多轮推理来估计不确定性，计算资源消耗大，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用自监督方法从单次LLM输出的token级特征估计不确定性，无需多次生成。

Result: 在多个LLM上的评估显示，该方法能有效检测低准确率输出，计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM实体链接工作流提供了计算效率高的不确定性估计方案。

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a
Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and
enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in
real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable
uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference,
posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient
alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating
uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing
the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on
tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty
estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is
achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a
cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.
The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL
workflows with limited computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在大量未筛选语料上训练，理解模型表示及其内部化数据成为主要挑战。需要开发可扩展的方法来探索语料库、发现偏见并实现模型可解释性。

Method: 在简·奥斯汀小说语料上训练GPT风格转换器模型，然后在多个隐藏层应用稀疏自编码器，提取稀疏可解释特征。

Conclusion: LLMs与SAEs结合可作为复杂数据集的可扩展探针，为语料探索、偏见发现和大规模模型可解释性提供新途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive,
uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they
internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing
LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model
behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the
training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels
of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We
then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse,
interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in
the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings
demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into
complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery,
and model interpretability at scale.

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前语音大语言模型偏见评估中使用的多项选择题基准的有效性，发现基于MCQA的偏见评估结果不能可靠地预测模型在其他任务格式（特别是长文本生成任务）中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型的偏见和公平性评估主要依赖多项选择题格式，但这种评估方法隐含地假设模型性能在不同MCQA任务、声音和其他任务格式中是一致的。本文旨在验证这一假设的合理性。

Method: 使用LoRA适配器对三个SpeechLLMs进行微调，诱导它们偏好刻板印象、反刻板印象或中性/不确定答案，然后评估这些行为是否能够泛化到其他MCQA基准和长文本创意生成任务。

Result: 结果显示，基于MCQA的偏见基准测试结果不能可靠地预测模型在其他MCQA基准上的表现，更重要的是，也不能预测在长文本任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 当前MCQA偏见基准在语音领域显示出有限的跨任务泛化能力，作者提出了一个评估套件来测量未来模型和基准的行为可转移性。

Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models
(SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA)
formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical,
anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt
and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model
performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task
formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe
that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA
behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or
neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise
to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative
generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks
fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more
importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias
benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech
domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour
transferability in future models and benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的输出受到不透明且频繁变化的公司内容审核政策影响，这些拒绝行为反映了公司政策并微妙地塑造公共话语，需要透明化这一黑盒过程。

Method: 使用包含400多个社会议题的数据集，审计OpenAI的审核端点、GPT-4.1、GPT-5和DeepSeek(中英文版本)，通过纵向跟踪检测政策变化。

Result: 发现公司政策变化(包括未公开宣布的)可以被检测到，识别了公司和模型特定的内容审核差异，并对不同拒绝形式进行了定性分析分类。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了纵向审计LLM的价值，AI Watchman是实现这一目标的系统，为理解LLM内容审核提供了透明度。

Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and
frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM
moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text
about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public
discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly
measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an
important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social
issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and
DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in
company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI
Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content
moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of
refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing
of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

Method: RJE框架包含三个核心组件：检索精炼推理路径、评估充分性、条件性探索额外证据。还引入了专门的辅助模块：推理路径排序、问题分解和检索器辅助探索。

Result: 使用专有LLM（如GPT-4o-mini）时优于现有基线，同时使小型开源LLM（3B和8B参数）在不微调的情况下达到竞争性结果。显著减少了LLM调用次数和token使用量。

Conclusion: RJE框架有效解决了现有KGQA方法的局限性，既提升了性能又提高了效率，使小型LLM也能在知识图谱问答任务中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language
models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based
methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while
agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these
limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that
retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and
conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces
specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively:
Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted
Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as
GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source
LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without
fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM
calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant
efficiency improvements.

### [110] [Measuring Algorithmic Partisanship via Zero-Shot Classification and Its Implications on Political Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01258)
*Nathan Junzi Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用零样本分类方法评估6个主流大语言模型的政治偏见，发现所有模型都表现出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和预设拒绝现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI快速普及，但训练数据偏差、人类偏见和算法缺陷导致的政治偏见问题持续存在，需要系统性评估。

Method: 采用零样本分类方法，结合意识形态对齐、主题相关性、响应情感和客观性四个指标，对6个LLM的1800个响应进行精细分类分析。

Result: 所有被评估的LLM都显示出增强的自由-威权主义倾向，存在推理替代和预设拒绝的显著实例。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人机交互中的心理影响，内在偏见可能渗透公共话语，根据地区既有社会政治结构导致从众或极化现象。

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI),
intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across
information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from
training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague
the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to
evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of
ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total
of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were
individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms,
each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric.
Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs
evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned
refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences
underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate
public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can
ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's
pre-existing socio-political structures.

*Nils Durner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过测试OpenAI的GPT-OSS-20B模型，探究了社会语用框架、语言选择和指令层次对模型拒绝行为的影响，发现特定提示策略可以显著改变模型的安全响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解大型语言模型在面对有害请求时的拒绝行为如何受到提示框架、语言和指令设计的影响，以识别安全漏洞并提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: 采用80次种子迭代测试多种危害场景，包括ZIP炸弹构建、合成卡号生成等，测试不同提示策略（如教育者角色、安全前提、步骤提示）和语言（英语、德语、法语）的影响。

Result: 复合提示可将ZIP炸弹任务的协助率从0%提升至97.5%；德语和法语的正式语域比英语更容易泄露信息；Linux终端角色扮演可覆盖开发者规则；AI辅助硬化方法可将泄露降至0%。

Conclusion: 模型的拒绝行为高度依赖于提示框架和语言选择，现有安全评估存在不一致性，需要更严格的测试和硬化方法来确保模型安全性。

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to
study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy
affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test
several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic
card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators,
and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator
persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip
assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal
registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts.
A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context
in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an
AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt
variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and
measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and
"harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of
pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures
materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal
rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising
reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for
reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

*Isa Inuwa-Dutse*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了GPT-OSS-20b模型在豪萨语等低资源语言环境中的安全漏洞，包括偏见、文化不敏感和事实错误，特别是模型会生成有害内容且安全协议在礼貌语言下失效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑模型对来自代表性不足社区用户的可靠性，关注低资源语言环境中的安全对齐问题。

Method: 使用豪萨语进行红队测试，通过最小提示诱导模型生成有害内容，并进行了61人参与的调查验证毒性认知。

Result: 模型存在严重错误，如认为常见杀虫剂和灭鼠剂可安全食用（98%调查参与者认为有毒），无法区分生熟食物，使用贬低性谚语构建错误论点。

Conclusion: 这些问题源于语言奖励劫持现象，模型优先考虑目标语言的流畅输出而非安全性和真实性，主要归因于低资源语言环境中安全调优不足。

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we
present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing
on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The
core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users
from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we
uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's
behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the
model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually
inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how
the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or
grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and
amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption
that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and
rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for
human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity
of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants
identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to
distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning
cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues
manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model
prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over
safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to
insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By
concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant
gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

TL;DR: AdaDetectGPT是一种新颖的文本检测器，通过自适应学习见证函数来增强基于logits的检测器性能，在各种数据集和LLM组合中显著提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的最先进检测器仅依赖对数概率统计可能不够优化，需要更有效的检测方法来判断文本是由人类还是大语言模型生成。

Method: 引入AdaDetectGPT分类器，从训练数据中自适应学习见证函数来增强基于logits的检测器性能，并提供统计保证。

Result: 广泛的数值研究表明，AdaDetectGPT在各种数据集和LLM组合中几乎一致地改进了最先进方法，改进幅度可达58%。

Conclusion: AdaDetectGPT通过自适应学习见证函数，显著提升了文本检测性能，为判断文本来源提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored
by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art
logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability
of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given
source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In
response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively
learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of
logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive
rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate.
Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the
state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the
improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is
available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

TL;DR: 提出渐进式自反思（PSR）方法，在推理时让大语言模型动态自我监控和修正输出，显著降低有害内容生成风险，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型部署时存在生成有害或不适当内容的风险，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 渐进式自反思技术，通过多轮自我反思动态修正输出，并引入轻量级自反思预测器自适应调整反思轮数以平衡安全性和计算效率。

Result: 在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct上攻击成功率从77.5%降至5.9%，在Llama-3.1-8B基础模型上从89.7%降至5.6%，在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct上从44.4%降至3.8%，同时保持良性任务性能。

Conclusion: 渐进式自反思作为一种可扩展的测试时方法，通过按输入风险配置动态分配计算资源，有效提升大语言模型安全性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to
the input's risk profile.

TL;DR: 提出了TraceDet框架，利用扩散大语言模型的多步去噪过程进行幻觉检测，相比现有方法在AUROC指标上平均提升15.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型中的幻觉问题研究不足，现有检测方法基于单步生成信号，不适合多步去噪的D-LLMs。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为动作轨迹，识别与幻觉响应最相关的子轨迹，利用多步去噪过程中的关键幻觉信号。

Result: 在各种开源D-LLMs上的实验表明，TraceDet持续改进幻觉检测，相比基线平均AUROC提升15.2%。

Conclusion: TraceDet通过利用D-LLMs的中间去噪步骤，有效解决了扩散大语言模型的幻觉检测问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination
problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in
real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed
for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them
ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the
multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel
framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs
for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action
trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned
response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the
sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet
leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of
D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open
source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination
detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Motivation: 情感分析是文本分析的重要组成部分，但书面语言的复杂性和评估语言的多样性阻碍了准确的情感分析。研究旨在探索使用基于transformer的BERT模型和其他大语言模型进行孟加拉电商评论情感分析的可行性。

Method: 使用包含4000个孟加拉语和英语客户评论样本的数据集，对多个模型进行微调，包括Llama-3.1-8B、Phi-3.5-mini-instruct、Mistral-7B-v0.1等，并采用参数高效微调方法（LoRA和PEFT）降低计算开销。

Conclusion: 研究强调了参数高效微调方法在降低计算开销方面的有效性，使大语言模型适用于资源受限的环境，展示了LLMs在情感分析任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger
field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state.
This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers'
feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large
language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability
of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However,
accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language
and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using
transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from
Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000
samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was
utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed
other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1,
DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes
how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower
computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited
resources. The results show how LLMs can

TL;DR: 提出了Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX)框架，通过并行运行多个使用不同工具策略的代理来增强LLM推理能力，在保持推理成本相近的情况下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然工具集成（如代码解释器和搜索）显著提升了LLM推理能力，但缺乏关于如何有效结合文本推理、编码和搜索的实用指导

Method: TUMIX是一个集成框架，并行运行多个代理，每个代理采用不同的工具使用策略和答案路径。代理基于问题和先前答案迭代共享和精炼响应

Result: 在关键推理基准测试中，TUMIX相比最先进的工具增强和测试时扩展方法，在Gemini-2.5-Pro和Gemini-2.5-Flash上平均准确率提升高达3.55%，推理成本相近

Conclusion: 代理多样性和质量至关重要，可以通过LLM自动优化代理设计来增强。TUMIX可以在达到足够置信度时停止精炼，仅需49%的推理成本即可保持性能

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly
enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and
Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core
challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for
diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an
ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing
distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively
share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In
experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art
tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy
improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference
costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced
by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt
refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only
49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,
albeit at a greater cost.

Motivation: 随着具备代理能力的大语言模型能够独立完成知识密集型任务，需要建立评估标准来评估深度研究工具的能力。

Method: 引入评估表来评估深度研究工具，选择学术综述写作作为用例任务，基于评估表对输出报告进行评估。

Result: 评估显示搜索引擎与独立深度研究工具之间存在巨大差距，在目标领域表示方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 需要精心设计的评估标准来评估深度研究工具的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) powered with argentic capabilities are able to
do knowledge-intensive tasks without human involvement. A prime example of this
tool is Deep research with the capability to browse the web, extract
information and generate multi-page reports. In this work, we introduce an
evaluation sheet that can be used for assessing the capability of Deep Research
tools. In addition, we selected academic survey writing as a use case task and
evaluated output reports based on the evaluation sheet we introduced. Our
findings show the need to have carefully crafted evaluation standards. The
evaluation done on OpenAI`s Deep Search and Google's Deep Search in generating
an academic survey showed the huge gap between search engines and standalone
Deep Research tools, the shortcoming in representing the targeted area.

TL;DR: HiSpec提出了一种分层推测解码框架，利用早期退出模型进行低开销的中间验证，显著提升大语言模型推理吞吐量，相比基线平均提升1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码中验证阶段是瓶颈（如3B模型为70B目标模型推测时，验证比token生成慢4倍），现有中间验证方法存在训练开销大、内存占用高和准确率妥协的问题。

Method: 利用早期退出模型进行中间验证，这些模型允许token提前退出层遍历，并设计方法重用draft模型、中间验证器和目标模型之间的键值缓存和隐藏状态，同时定期验证中间验证器接受的draft token。

Result: 在各种代表性基准测试和模型上的评估显示，HiSpec相比基线单层推测平均提升吞吐量1.28倍，最高可达2.01倍，且不损害准确率。

Conclusion: HiSpec通过早期退出模型实现高效的中间验证，解决了推测解码中的验证瓶颈，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了推理吞吐量。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model
to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often
the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation
when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus
only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces
verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing
methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate
verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate
verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate
heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical
}\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for
high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE)
models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to
exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that
hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely
suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and
memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a
methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states
between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain
accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the
intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various
representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by
1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline
single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在基于事件的问题上表现不佳，特别是需要因果或时序推理的任务

Method: 提出TAG-EQA框架，将结构化因果事件图转换为自然语言语句注入LLM输入，包含9种提示配置（3种策略×3种输入模态）

Result: 在TORQUESTRA基准测试中，相比纯文本基线平均提升5%准确率，零样本设置下最高提升12%，图增强CoT提示有效时提升18%

Conclusion: 因果图可以在不微调的情况下增强LLM的事件推理能力，为基于提示的问答提供了一种灵活的结构编码方式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often
struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or
temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question
Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM
inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements.
TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only,
graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how
structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA
improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to
12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is
effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings
show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without
fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义嵌入距离的无结构评估方法，用于低成本自动评估语言模型响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型响应评估方法要么过于昂贵（如LLM-as-a-Judge），要么远离真实条件（如字符串匹配、logprob），需要更实用且低成本的解决方案。

Method: 使用语义嵌入距离将目标候选与任意LM生成文本进行匹配，采用参数少于100亿的嵌入模型，实现低成本鲁棒分类。

Result: 在3个数据集和3种不同LM架构上测试，回归分数约0.97，相对于人类标注者的准确率约96%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算成本相对较低但性能接近人类水平的语言模型响应自动评估方案。

Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece
in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and
quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to
response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.
LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,
logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The
method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates
with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the
response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$
parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of
~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM
architectures.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在特定领域定量推理方面的挑战，特别是在需要专业知识和复杂问答的领域，如金融领域。

Method: 基于两阶段微调框架的Expert Question Decomposition方法，使用奖励函数衡量生成子问题对问答结果改善的有效性，仅需数千训练示例和单A100 GPU进行微调。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上评估，EQD在不同LLM上持续提升问答性能0.6%至10.5%，超越领域调优模型和先进提示策略。

Conclusion: 在领域特定问答中，单个支持性问题往往比详细指导步骤提供更大收益，EQD方法在平衡领域知识与计算效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large
language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and
complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question
Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain
knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning
framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of
generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few
thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with
inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD
outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting
strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by
specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark
datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5%
across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in
domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit
than detailed guidance steps.

Result: 在语言建模、多跳问答和结构敏感任务中，ReSSFormer在可比FLOPs和参数预算下持续优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ReSSFormer展示了在可扩展性、效率和结构灵活性方面的优势，为Transformer架构提供了改进方案。

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability
across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning,
computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid
layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We
present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates
three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for
iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM)
for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder
Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces
conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full
attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token
topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and
structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines
under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability,
efficiency, and structural flexibility.

### [124] [CLUE: Non-parametric Verification from Experience via Hidden-State Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01591)
*Zhenwen Liang,Ruosen Li,Yujun Zhou,Linfeng Song,Dian Yu,Xinya Du,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE方法利用LLM隐藏状态作为统一验证基础，通过无参数聚类分析隐藏状态轨迹来验证答案正确性，在多项基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM输出质量评估方法存在局限性：基于文本的方法容易过拟合表面特征，基于token概率置信度的方法在不校准模型上表现不佳。而隐藏状态同时包含语义特征和置信度信息，可作为更丰富的验证信号源。

Method: 提出CLUE验证器，通过分析隐藏状态轨迹的几何可分性特征。该方法无训练参数，仅计算隐藏状态增量，基于过去经验形成的"成功"和"失败"聚类，通过最近质心距离进行分类。

Result: 在AIME 24/25和GPQA基准测试中，CLUE持续优于LLM-as-a-judge基线，匹配或超过现代置信度方法。在AIME 24上，使用1.5B模型将准确率从56.7%提升至70.0%。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态轨迹包含编码答案正确性的几何可分特征，CLUE的简单有效性证明了这一底层信号的强度，为LLM输出验证提供了统一基础。

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a
critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information
(e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues,
or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on
less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial
projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden
states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical
features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly
align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper
explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We
show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable
signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we
present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately
minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only
summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies
correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure''
clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights
the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently
outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern
confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and
majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24
with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0%
(top-maj@16).

Motivation: RAG框架包含嵌入模型和生成器模型，两者都可以通过微调来提高新任务上的性能。存在多种微调策略，但它们的成本和效益各不相同，需要系统比较。

Method: 评估和比较了三种RAG微调策略：独立微调（分别微调嵌入和生成器模型）、联合微调（同时微调两个模型）和两阶段微调（先微调一个模型再微调另一个）。

Result: 所有策略在EM和F1生成质量指标上取得了大致相当的改进，但计算成本存在显著差异。

Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs),
Fine-tuning, Question Answering, Joint fine-tuning TL;DR: We evaluate and
compare strategies for fine-tuning Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines, including independent fine-tuning, joint fine-tuning, and two-phase
fine-tuning. Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular
framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models
(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database
that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the
retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and
generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on
a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and
benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning
strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our
experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal
improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have
significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal
fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes
context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the
embedding and generator models is required.

Motivation: 生物医学文献的指数级增长给获取精确医疗信息带来挑战，现有生物医学问答系统主要关注简短答案，无法提供临床决策所需的全面解释。

Method: 结合BioBERT嵌入与FAISS索引，比较多种重排序策略（BM25、ColBERT、MonoT5）优化上下文选择，然后通过微调的T5模型合成证据。

Result: 在PubMedQA数据集上的实验结果显示显著优于基线模型，在BLEU、ROUGE和METEOR指标上取得实质性提升。

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PureTC-1B，一个针对Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct的三阶段稳定化流程，通过参数高效的LoRA适配器解决传统中文模型中的token级不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在传统中文部署中存在token级不稳定性问题，模型会不可预测地输出非传统中文字符或切换到其他语言，这阻碍了成本效益高、设备端和延迟敏感的AI应用。

Method: 采用三阶段稳定化流程：1）在传统中文语料上进行持续预训练；2）使用指令数据进行监督微调；3）基于传统中文一致性偏好的直接偏好优化，使用参数高效的LoRA适配器而不需要全模型重新训练。

Result: 在模拟真实使用场景的基准测试中，PureTC-1B相比基础模型减少了51.3%的非传统中文输出token；在命名实体翻译任务中，相比Llama-3B和Qwen-1.5B分别减少了77.2%和57.2%的错误语言token。

Conclusion: 即使在1B规模下，也能实现稳健的传统中文一致性，该流程可重现、仅需适配器且对硬件友好，为传统中文及其他非英语语言的语言稳定性提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and
latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese
(TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit
non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this
practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization
pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model
released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines
Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model
retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B
achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens
versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B
further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and
57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable
even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and
hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance
language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMAS框架通过动态图设计器解决传统多智能体系统拓扑结构僵化的问题，实现基于任务特性的自适应智能体路径配置，显著提升LLM多智能体系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体系统受限于固定的图拓扑结构，缺乏上下文响应能力，导致在不同学术和商业工作负载中效果下降，需要更灵活的架构设计。

Method: 引入AMAS框架，通过动态图设计器组件，利用轻量级LLM适配自主识别任务特定的最优图配置，消除对通用结构模板的依赖，基于输入特性智能引导查询轨迹。

Result: 在问答、数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，AMAS系统性地超越了最先进的单智能体和多智能体方法，适用于多种LLM架构。

Conclusion: 上下文敏感的结构适应性是高性能LLM多智能体系统部署的基本要求，动态图设计是实现这一目标的关键技术。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language
processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous
multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent
barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by
inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness,
resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial
workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a
paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel
dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific
optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the
reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS
exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct
query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation
across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation
benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art
single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our
investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability
constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS
deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在漏洞，恶意用户可以通过操纵输入文本来获取不良响应。这些越狱提示旨在绕过安全防护机制，因此需要有效识别方法。

Method: 使用不同机器学习模型区分越狱提示和真实使用，包括BERT模型的端到端微调，并可视化区分关键词。

Result: 在当前数据集上，端到端微调的BERT模型在识别越狱提示方面表现最佳，能够识别使用新策略的越狱攻击。

Conclusion: 提示结构中的显式自反性可以作为越狱意图的信号，微调BERT模型是当前最有效的越狱检测方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that
allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of
the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM
into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses
acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability
of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from
genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use
previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets
the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying
jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine
prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a
signal of jailbreak intention.

Motivation: 自回归LLM在语言理解和生成方面表现出色，但在文本嵌入任务中应用较慢，且由于单向注意力机制的限制，其语义表示在探测任务中的分析受限

Method: 通过额外训练步骤测试Llama架构的不同变体，逐步启用双向注意力和无监督/有监督对比学习

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: 未在摘要中明确说明

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional
performance in language understanding and generation. However, their
application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the
analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the
constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by
enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the
Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling
bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络安全竞赛中，AI驱动的攻击系统发展迅速，而传统防御手段难以跟上。现有研究和工具在防御功能上分散，存在盲点。缺乏定义安全系统代理能力、评估闭环代理和衡量性能的框架。

Method: 引入CLASP框架，将安全生命周期（侦察、利用、根因分析、补丁合成、验证）与核心代理能力（规划、工具使用、记忆、推理、反思与感知）对齐，提供评估安全任务中代理能力的通用词汇和标准。定义了闭环能力评分（CLC Score），量化闭环程度和操作有效性。

Result: 将CLASP应用于21个代表性工作，识别系统优势和能力差距。提出了闭环基准测试的要求。

Conclusion: CLASP和CLC评分为推进功能级性能和衡量闭环安全代理提供了必要的词汇、诊断工具和测量方法。

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems
evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling
remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots
that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit
confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer
promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic
capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled
method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their
performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous
Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle
(reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis,
validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory,
reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric
for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21
representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where
capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score,
a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational
effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark.
Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and
measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure
closed loop security agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态对话摘要（MDS）是一个重要任务，但缺乏基于人类标注的强健元评估基准来支持自动评估方法的发展。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的过滤框架，利用跨模态的互斥关键信息（MEKI）来确保数据质量和丰富性，并首次识别和形式化了MDS特有的关键评估维度。

Result: 对最先进的模态评估方法进行了基准测试，揭示了它们在区分先进MLLM生成的摘要方面的局限性，以及它们对各种偏见的敏感性。

Conclusion: MDSEval为MDS评估提供了首个全面的元评估基准，有助于推动多模态对话摘要领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust
automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human
effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark
grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first
meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues,
corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality
aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering
framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across
modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation
dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation
methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced
MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

TL;DR: FOR-Prompting是一种非对称推理协议，通过Defender提出答案、Objectioner提出质疑、Host确保一致性的角色结构，实现自我修正推理，在数学推理任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理协议如Chain of Thought和Tree of Thought缺乏外部质疑机制来引发自我修正，需要一种能够通过结构化质疑促进推理改进的方法。

Method: 采用三角色非对称协议：Defender提出初始答案，Objectioner提出质疑但不直接修正，Host确保一致性和完成对话，纯提示级别操作无需重新训练。

Result: 在GSM8K任务上比单提示提升约22个百分点，与CoT精度相当，推理和连贯性评分提高10%以上；小模型Llama3.2:1b准确率提升约19%；能无工具或人工监督修正错误。

Conclusion: FOR-Prompting是一种模型无关的协议，通过角色化质疑引导推理，适用于不同规模模型，支持大规模质疑引导推理研究，在开放任务中展现增强的探索和精炼能力。

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)
organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external
questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From
Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender
proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no
direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe
about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with
more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1
judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision
on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19%
accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for
small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative
analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with
dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is
model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured
turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without
retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型是否真正使用组合机制来解决组合任务，特别是两跳事实回忆任务。

Method: 使用logit lens分析残差流激活，识别模型处理组合任务时的两种机制，并研究嵌入空间几何对机制选择的影响。

Result: 确认LLMs存在组合性差距，发现两种处理机制：组合式（计算中间结果）和直接式（无中间结果），机制选择与嵌入空间线性映射存在相关。

Conclusion: LLMs解决组合任务的方式并非总是组合性的，机制选择受嵌入空间几何特性影响，这对理解模型内部工作机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of
solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using
compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs
solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as
$g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the
"compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y =
g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$.
Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two
processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$,
computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves
them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate
variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to
be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being
dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in
the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗预咨询任务中，SFT训练数据的轮次分布存在偏斜，导致LLM在长对话中产生重复、格式正确但诊断信息不足的问题，即格式惯性。

Method: 采用数据中心化方法，重新平衡训练数据集的轮次分布。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著缓解了医疗预咨询中的格式惯性问题。

Conclusion: 通过简单的数据平衡策略可以有效解决LLM在医疗预咨询任务中的格式惯性问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant
improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical
pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common
approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical
pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training
on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,
where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically
uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed
failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the
turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that
our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical
pre-consultation.

TL;DR: MathLens是一个新的多模态推理基准测试，专门用于分解几何问题的子技能，包括感知、推理和整合三个组件，揭示不同训练方法对各组件的不同影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型的评估主要依赖总体准确率，这种单一分数无法揭示模型在哪些方面有所改进以及如何改进。需要设计能够分解多模态推理子技能的基准测试。

Method: 设计MathLens基准测试，将几何问题分解为三个组件：感知（从原始输入中提取信息）、推理（对可用信息进行操作）和整合（选择相关感知证据并在推理中应用）。通过符号化问题规范提供注释，包括视觉图表、文本描述、需要双模态的问题和细粒度感知技能测试。

Result: 分析发现：1）强化学习主要增强感知能力，特别是在文本监督支持下；2）推理能力只有在感知能力提升时才会改善；3）整合能力是最弱的环节；4）不同训练方法的鲁棒性表现不同：RL提高图表变化的稳定性，而多模态SFT因过拟合而降低鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多模态推理的不同子技能需要不同的训练策略，整合能力是当前最需要改进的环节，未来的工作应该针对性地提升整合能力。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging
domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated
by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are
improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the
subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of
textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into
three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs,
Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting
relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each
test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate
reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and
probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic
specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our
analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First,
reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when
supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves
perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in
tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with
residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally,
robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas
multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and
experimental logs.

Motivation: 工程设计过程需要遵循技术规范和标准，但目前产品规格书和设计标准仍以文档为中心，难以实现数字化工业工作的目标。

Method: 使用建模模式创建模块化本体，基于国际管道、材料和阀门设计标准，采用W3C兼容格式存储，并与顶级本体ISO DIS 23726-3对齐。通过创建阀门数据表和制造商产品类型的OWL实例，应用语义推理和可执行设计规则。

Result: 成功测试了基于国际标准和行业规范创建的本体，能够自动化验证特定阀门数据表是否符合相关行业标准，并确定产品类型是否满足阀门规格要求。

Conclusion: 创建基于IDO的共享、可重用模块化设计标准本体，使语义推理能够应用于设备选择过程，为标准机构向数字化智能标准过渡展示了潜力。

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply
with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design
standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize
industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information
held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable,
machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of
the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to
create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently
referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve
design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format,
and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS
23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping
standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are
instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic
representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset.
We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances
of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create
instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated
validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards.
Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether
the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable
IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to
be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of
this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart
Standards.

### [138] [Can LLMs Refuse Questions They Do Not Know? Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782)
*Wenbo Pan,Jie Xu,Qiguang Chen,Junhao Dong,Libo Qin,Xinfeng Li,Haining Yu,Xiaohua Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Refusal Index (RI)指标，通过拒绝概率与错误概率的Spearman秩相关来准确衡量LLMs对未知问题的拒绝能力，解决了现有指标在测量知识感知拒绝能力时的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指标无法准确测量LLMs的知识感知拒绝能力：简单拒绝率指标受拒绝倾向影响，校准指标是代理指标而非实际拒绝行为。需要开发能忠实反映模型对未知问题拒绝能力的指标。

Method: 定义RI为拒绝概率与错误概率的Spearman秩相关，设计轻量级两轮评估方法，通过两次标准评估运行中的观察拒绝率来有效估计RI。

Result: 在16个模型和5个数据集上的实验表明，RI能准确量化模型在事实任务中的内在知识感知拒绝能力，且在不同拒绝率下保持稳定，提供与模型整体准确率和拒绝率无关的一致模型排名。

Conclusion: LLMs在事实任务中虽然准确率高，但拒绝行为可能不可靠且脆弱。需要将传统准确率指标与Refusal Index结合进行全面的真实性评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their
knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial
for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure
this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by
refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different
refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are
proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes
rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the
Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs
refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation
between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically
measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently
estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.
Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI
accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in
factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and
provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy
and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but
previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high
accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and
fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy
metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了16种无监督指标在从俄罗斯司法判决中提取语义块的质量，发现词频连贯性和覆盖率/块完整性指标与专家评分最一致，而LLM评估得分仅显示中等一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律自然语言处理的快速发展需要可扩展的方法来评估从司法判决中提取文本的质量，特别是在缺乏预标注真实数据的情况下。

Method: 使用16种无监督指标（包括文档基础、语义、结构、伪真实数据和法律特定类别）评估从1000份匿名俄罗斯司法决策中提取7个语义块的质量，并与7168个专家评分进行验证。

Result: 词频连贯性（Pearson r=0.540）和覆盖率/块完整性（Pearson r=0.513）与专家评分最一致，而法律术语密度显示强负相关（Pearson r=-0.479）。LLM评估得分仅显示中等一致性（Pearson r=0.382）。

Conclusion: 无监督指标（包括基于LLM的方法）能够实现可扩展的筛选，但由于中等相关性和低CCC值，在高风险法律环境中不能完全替代人类判断。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language
processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from
judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including
novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks
from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168
expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based,
semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories,
operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's
concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal
that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE =
0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC =
0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density
(Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative
correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin
CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using
gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These
findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches,
enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values,
cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts. This work
advances legal NLP by providing annotation-free evaluation tools, with
implications for judicial analytics and ethical AI deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FraudSquad混合检测模型，用于检测LLM生成的垃圾评论，在三个LLM生成数据集上比现有方法在精确率和召回率上分别提升44.22%和43.01%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的垃圾评论高度逼真，对现有检测系统构成挑战，威胁在线平台的可信度。

Method: 提出FraudSquad混合检测模型，结合预训练语言模型的文本嵌入和图门控变换器进行垃圾节点分类，无需手动特征工程或大量训练资源。

Result: 在三个LLM生成数据集上显著优于现有基线方法，同时在两个人工编写的垃圾数据集上也取得良好效果，模型规模适中且需要少量标注数据。

Conclusion: 研究贡献包括新的合成数据集、实用检测框架和实证证据，强调了在LLM时代适应垃圾检测的紧迫性。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly
persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose
significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the
credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic
LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by
product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm
the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this
threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text
embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for
spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral
signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training
resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three
LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two
human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model
size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution
for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets,
a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the
urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are

*Dane Williamson,Yangfeng Ji,Matthew Dwyer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在数学问题上存在语法盲点，即使语义简单但表达方式陌生时也会错误应用推理策略。通过从正确示例中提取语法模板重述问题，可以显著提高回答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在数学问题解决中存在系统性的语法盲点问题，即模型会将熟悉的推理策略错误地应用到语义简单但表达方式陌生的问题上，这反映了表面形式与内部表示的脆弱耦合。

Method: 使用从正确示例中提取的语法模板重述错误回答的问题，保持语义不变但降低结构复杂度。采用基于依存局部理论的指标量化语法复杂度。

Result: 重述后的问题往往能得到正确答案。更高的DLT分数与多个数据集中的失败率增加相关，表明语法复杂度与错误率正相关。

Conclusion: 许多推理错误源于结构错位而非概念难度，语法感知的干预可以揭示和缓解这些归纳失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving
abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their
training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind
spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that
are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors
are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle
coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we
rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from
correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing
structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic
complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show
that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across
multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from
structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that
syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

TL;DR: SCRIBES是一个基于强化学习的框架，通过利用同一网站内网页的布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，实现高效的大规模半结构化网页内容提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTML表格、列表和信息框等半结构化内容在网络上占据大量事实数据，但现有方法要么缺乏泛化能力，要么由于每页都需要LLM推理而资源密集。

Method: 使用强化学习框架，利用网页布局相似性作为奖励信号，生成可重用的提取脚本，并在CommonCrawl数据上进行迭代训练。

Result: 在脚本质量上比强基线高出13%以上，GPT-4o的下游问答准确率提升超过4%。

Conclusion: SCRIBES实现了可扩展且资源高效的网络信息提取，解决了现有方法的泛化性和资源消耗问题。

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a
substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates
usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains
challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are
resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce
SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel
reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across
webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each
page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be
applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further
improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild
CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong
baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question
answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and
resource-efficient web information extraction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉-语言模型参数量巨大且需要海量数据训练，远超儿童语言习得所需的数据量。BabyLM挑战旨在解决这一差异，同时多模态模型在纯语言任务中表现不佳也是一个重要问题。

Method: 在低资源设置下开发语言和多模态模型，使用发展上合理的数据集。通过模型融合方法，将多模态模型与纯语言模型的参数进行加权线性插值融合。

Result: 多模态模型在关注语法的纯语言基准测试中表现不佳，但通过与纯文本模型的融合可以在一定程度上缓解这个问题，同时保持多模态性能。

Conclusion: 模型融合方法有助于改善多模态模型在纯语言任务中的表现，为解决多模态模型语言能力不足问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and
learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that
children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our
approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this
discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource
settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models
outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language
model literature is that these models tend to underperform in
\textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only
abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model
merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of
language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results
corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only
benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can
help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal
performance.

TL;DR: REPAIR是一个终身编辑框架，通过渐进式自适应干预和重整合机制，支持精确、低成本的LLM更新，同时保护非目标知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM后训练中获取新知识或纠正错误的高成本问题，以及重训练带来的意外副作用，需要支持精确、低成本的模型更新。

Method: 采用闭环反馈机制和动态内存管理来缓解大规模顺序编辑的不稳定性和冲突，结合频繁知识融合和强局部性保护来避免意外连锁反应。

Result: 实验表明REPAIR在多个模型家族中将编辑准确率提升10%-30%，显著减少知识遗忘。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发可靠、可扩展且持续演进的LLM提供了一个稳健框架。

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high
cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side
effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we
introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and
Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and
low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates
the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a
closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management.
Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong
locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional
distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects.
Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30%
across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.
This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and
continually evolving LLMs.

Conclusion: 奖励模型是提升LLM推理能力的重要工具，本文为有效部署和进一步发展奖励模型提供了实用见解和行动指南。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning
performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune
LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from
multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic
introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in
LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their
architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we
explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal
outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative
self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based
finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the
selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on
existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide
actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 当前LLMs的防御机制零散且不成熟，需要统一框架来提升对抗鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 采用逆向语言建模方法，将LLMs从静态生成器转变为可分析系统，同时增强鲁棒性和实现基础化。

Result: ILM框架能够同时提升LLMs对输入扰动的鲁棒性，并识别潜在有害输入触发器，有助于红队测试。

Conclusion: ILM为下一代LLMs奠定了基础，使其更具鲁棒性、基础化、可控性和可信度。

Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and
underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote
adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a
unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to
input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by
inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers.
ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems,
potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation
LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more
controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的声明验证方法主要依赖提示工程或预设推理流程，缺乏统一的训练范式来提升必要的技能。在线声明验证需要迭代的证据检索和推理，但现有方法未能充分模拟真实场景。

Method: 提出Veri-R1在线强化学习框架，让LLM与搜索引擎动态交互，通过奖励信号明确塑造其规划、检索和推理行为。

Result: Veri-R1将联合准确率提升高达30%，证据分数翻倍，经常超越更大规模的对应模型。消融研究揭示了奖励组件的影响以及输出logits与标签准确率之间的联系。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习对于精确和可信的声明验证非常有效，为未来研究提供了基础。代码已开源以支持社区在LLM赋能的声明验证方面的进展。

Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted
considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and
transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only
judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and
reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or
predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to
improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a
search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning,
retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and
retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios
and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that
Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often
surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the
impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label
accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and
faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We
release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim
verification.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了语言模型能否通过多维主观标注来预测个体的价值解释，发现同时提供SEAT四个维度的标注信息能显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认识到个体价值解释具有主观性且受社会文化背景影响，为了让AI系统能够与多样化的人类视角对齐并避免偏向多数观点，需要识别个体价值解释。

Method: 使用SEAT维度作为个体解释性视角的代理，评估在零样本和少样本设置下，提供个体的情感、情绪、论证和主题标注信息是否能帮助语言模型预测其价值解释。

Result: 实验表明同时提供所有SEAT维度比单独维度或基线表现更优，个体标注者间的差异凸显了考虑个体主观标注的重要性。

Conclusion: 这是首个超越人口统计学特征、研究标注行为对价值预测影响的尝试，为未来大规模验证提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural
background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing
individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that
can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority
viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict
individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective
annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate
whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion,
Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting
their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot
settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields
superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no
information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual
variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the
incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our
knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first
attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation
behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future
large-scale validation.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了数据库模式规范化对NL2SQL系统性能的影响，发现非规范化模式在简单检索查询中表现更好，而规范化模式在聚合查询中更优，最佳模式设计取决于查询类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NL2SQL研究大多在固定模式上评估模型，忽视了模式设计对性能的重要影响。本文旨在系统研究模式规范化程度如何影响NL2SQL系统的表现。

Method: 评估八个领先的大语言模型，使用具有不同规范化程度的合成数据集（1NF-3NF）和真实学术论文数据集，比较零样本和少样本设置下的性能。

Result: 非规范化模式在简单检索查询中准确率高，即使使用成本效益高的零样本模型；规范化模式在聚合查询中表现更好，能有效避免数据重复和NULL值问题。

Conclusion: NL2SQL应用的最佳模式设计取决于支持的查询类型，建议在实际场景中考虑自适应模式选择策略。

Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked
factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research
evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on
performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's
impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and
real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled
synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper
datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas
offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective
models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF)
introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type
prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing
few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better
performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and
NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings
suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the
types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of
considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating
adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语等低资源语言缺乏有效的仇恨言论检测工具，现有方法多为单任务且覆盖范围有限，需要开发多方面的检测系统来提升在线安全性和公平性。

Method: 构建首个多任务孟加拉语仇恨言论数据集BanglaMultiHate，采用经典基线、单语预训练模型和LLM进行零样本提示和LoRA微调的对比实验。

Result: 实验显示LoRA调优的LLM与BanglaBERT表现相当，但文化语言基础的预训练对稳健性能仍至关重要。

Conclusion: 该数据集和发现为低资源环境下开发文化对齐的审核工具建立了更强基准，强调了文化语言基础预训练的重要性。

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and
information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also
provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and
bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such
content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection
systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where
moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources
and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited
coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps
by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset,
BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building
on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning
classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot
prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a

are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded
pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and

TL;DR: 本研究采用过程导向方法，通过约束性决策框架分析LLMs作为计算作者的创造力，发现模型普遍更重视风格而非其他叙事元素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs创造力评估主要关注输出质量而非创作过程，本研究旨在填补这一空白，从叙事学角度分析LLMs的作者创造力。

Method: 使用受控提示分配作者角色，通过约束性决策框架分析模型的创意偏好，并探究其选择理由。

Result: LLMs一致性地强调风格元素，优于角色、事件和场景等其他叙事要素，不同模型展现出独特的创意偏好特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统分析AI作者创造力提供了新颖工具，揭示了LLMs在叙事创作中的特定偏好模式。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused
primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape
them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to
examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based
decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting
to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the
models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other
elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the
reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive
profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel
systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了Streaming RAG框架，在端到端语音对话系统中集成工具使用，通过并行预测工具查询来降低延迟，提高准确性和响应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话系统虽然能生成更自然、低延迟的响应，但容易产生幻觉，缺乏事实基础。需要将文本对话系统中的工具使用能力扩展到语音系统中。

Method: 开发了Streaming RAG框架，在用户说话时并行预测工具查询，并训练模型在持续语音中发出工具调用，生成融合音频查询和检索文本结果的语音摘要。

Result: 在AudioCRAG基准测试中，QA准确率相对提高200%（从11.1%提升到34.2%），工具使用延迟降低20%。

Conclusion: Streaming RAG方法不仅提高了语音对话系统的准确性，还显著改善了用户体验，且该方法与模态无关，可应用于文本输入，为更智能的实时AI助手铺平道路。

Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful
alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural,
expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems
remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While
text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as
web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend
tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that
tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting
conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived
latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before
the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline
that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how
to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text
results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our
approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries
from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results
demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200%
relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by
reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is
modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for
more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SCoT：一种用于双工口语对话系统的流式思维链框架，通过交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应，解决了传统VAD无法区分停顿和话轮结束的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端口语对话系统依赖VAD进行话轮转换，但VAD无法区分停顿和话轮完成。双工SDS模型通过预测包括静音标记的连续输出来解决这个问题，但通常具有复杂的双通道架构且在语义推理上落后于级联模型。

Method: 使用流式思维链框架，交替处理固定时长的用户输入和分块生成响应。利用帧级对齐为每个块创建中间目标——对齐的用户转录和系统响应。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有双工方法产生更连贯和可解释的响应，同时相比逐轮系统支持更低延迟和重叠交互。

Conclusion: SCoT框架在保持双工系统优势的同时，提高了响应质量和语义推理能力，为口语对话系统提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity
detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses
and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output
continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit
VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind
cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose
SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating
between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a
blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate
targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.
Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable
responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and
overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推测解码技术在不同任务中速度提升的不均匀分布问题，特别是对欠拟合和代表性不足任务加速效果较差的现象。

Method: 通过理论分析量化推测解码的不公平性，识别导致差异速度提升的因素，并提出相应的缓解策略。

Result: 验证了缓解策略的有效性，在多个模型对中平均改善了公平性指标12%。

Conclusion: 推测解码存在任务间速度提升的不公平问题，需要针对性策略来减少这种差异，确保技术应用的公平性。

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically
supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard
technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language
models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the
lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the
paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly
distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often
underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an
analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the
factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by
these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce
speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,
revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

TL;DR: RESTRAIN是一种自约束强化学习框架，通过利用无标签数据中的信号来提升推理模型的性能，无需人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于人工标注数据的强化学习方法成本高昂且在复杂任务上表现不佳，需要一种无需标注数据就能持续改进模型的方法。

Method: RESTRAIN采用自惩罚机制，利用模型整个答案分布中的信号：惩罚过度自信的推理路径和低一致性示例，同时保留有希望的推理链。

Result: 在AIME25上Pass@1提升高达140.7%，MMLU_STEM提升36.2%，GPQA-Diamond提升19.6%，几乎达到使用黄金标签训练的效果。

Conclusion: RESTRAIN为无需黄金标签实现更强推理能力提供了一条可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought
reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in
labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is
experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by
adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with
Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of
gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to
spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire
answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency
examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization
mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO,
enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging
reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data.
With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to
+140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on
GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.
These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward
stronger reasoning without gold labels.

TL;DR: 提出RL4HS强化学习框架，通过span级奖励函数激励推理，用于检测大语言模型生成的幻觉内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多将幻觉检测视为二元任务，但实际应用需要识别幻觉的具体范围，这是一个多步决策过程。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，引入Class-Aware Policy Optimization来解决奖励不平衡问题，使用span级奖励函数激励推理。

Result: 在RAGTruth基准测试（摘要、问答、数据到文本）中，RL4HS超越了预训练推理模型和监督微调。

Conclusion: 强化学习与span级奖励对于检测幻觉范围是必要的，CoT推理在多次采样时具有生成至少一个正确答案的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported
content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination
detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying
hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This
naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the
complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we
first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least
one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose
RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a
span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization
and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance
issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question
answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models
and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement
learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱交互对于非计算机背景的用户存在障碍，因为SPARQL查询语言门槛较高。LLM可以通过Text2SPARQL翻译降低这一门槛，本文受Text2SPARQL挑战赛的推动，旨在改进该领域。

Method: 基于SPINACH LLM代理，采用迭代探索和执行过程，而非单次翻译，将自然语言问题转化为SPARQL查询。

Result: 描述了整体架构和设计决策背后的推理，并对代理行为进行了深入分析，以获取未来针对性改进的见解。

Conclusion: 该方法为降低知识图谱查询门槛提供了有效途径，通过迭代过程提高了Text2SPARQL翻译的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a
background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)
has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that
barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this
paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent
that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single
shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the
overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also
conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future
areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL
challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the
Text2SPARQL domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估强调执行准确性但忽视了链式思维推理是否与真实动作对齐，这无法评估潜在的推理-执行差距，可能导致用户过度信任看似合理的推理而授权有害动作。

Method: 引入真实对齐(GTA)指标来衡量CoT推理中隐含的动作是否与真实动作匹配，结合EM指标共同评估推理准确性和执行准确性，识别执行差距(EG)和推理差距(RG)。

Result: 实验结果显示推理-执行差距普遍存在，执行差距比推理差距更频繁；扩大模型规模能减少总体差距，但即使在最大模型中执行差距仍然显著。

Conclusion: 该框架可靠地反映了最先进模型中的系统性EG/RG模式，为开发更可信的移动使用代理提供了具体诊断支持。

Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great
potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating
corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies
suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve
the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution
accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth
actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,
which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may
unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss
or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to
diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment
(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the
ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)
metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.
This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)
Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action
but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but
reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results
across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution
gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than
reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,
sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis
shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in
state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support
the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

TL;DR: AMPO是一个自适应多指导策略优化框架，通过按需使用多个教师模型的指导来增强大语言模型的长链推理能力，在数学推理任务上比基线提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖自我探索或单一教师模型来引导长链推理，这会引入模型内在偏见并限制探索，最终影响推理多样性和性能。

Method: AMPO框架自适应地利用多个熟练教师模型的指导，但仅在策略模型无法生成正确解决方案时使用，采用"按需指导"方法扩展探索同时保留自我发现的价值，并包含基于理解的筛选机制。

Result: 在数学推理任务上比GRPO基线提升4.3%，在分布外任务上提升12.2%，显著提升Pass@k性能并实现更多样化的探索。使用四个同等规模教师模型即可达到与使用单个更强大教师模型相当的效果。

Conclusion: AMPO为获得卓越推理能力和泛化能力提供了一条更高效和可扩展的路径，证明了多教师指导策略在增强大语言模型推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy
teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may
introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting
reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher
strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance
Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages
guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy
model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach
expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover,
AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the
student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend,
thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive
experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with
a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on
out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and
enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our
method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more
powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate
a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including
the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X
(formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional
well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content.
Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been
developed around the English language, and methods for detecting
Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language
cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the
effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language
content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and
used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We
conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for

BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM
with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂问题上表现出色，但对简单问题往往产生不必要的冗长推理步骤(过度思考)，这会降低模型效率且难以根据问题复杂度调整推理深度。

Method: 引入TECA指标衡量推理过程中的探索程度，提出CER机制实现"探索简要，然后决策"的推理范式，帮助模型动态确定停止推理的最佳时机。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，该方法显著缓解了过度思考问题，同时保持问题解决能力。在简单数据集上平均响应长度减少高达71%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够创建更高效和自适应的推理过程，在保持性能的同时大幅提升推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they
often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy
reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of
the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the
complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token
Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration
throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm
-- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy
Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model
dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and
provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental
results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach
substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving
ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by
up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in
creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体过度依赖开放网络搜索，存在内容噪声大、不可靠的问题，且许多现实任务需要精确的领域特定知识。虽然MCP协议允许智能体访问数千种专业工具，但尚不清楚智能体是否能有效利用这些工具并与通用搜索结合解决复杂任务。

Method: 开发了InfoMosaic-Bench基准测试，涵盖医疗、金融、地图、视频、网络和多领域集成六个领域。使用InfoMosaic-Flow可扩展流程合成任务，将任务条件基于已验证的工具输出，强制执行跨源依赖关系，并过滤掉可通过简单查找解决的捷径案例。

Result: 对14个最先进LLM智能体的实验显示：仅使用网络信息时GPT-5准确率仅38.2%，通过率67.5%；领域工具提供选择性但不一致的益处；22.4%的失败源于工具使用或选择错误。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在工具处理方面仍存在困难，需要更好的工具集成能力来有效利用多源信息解决复杂任务。

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However,
existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two
fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many
real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from
the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to
interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this
limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such
tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with
general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce
InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information
seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains
(medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration),
InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with
domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable
pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces
cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial
lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments
with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information
alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass
rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving
some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from
incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still
struggle with even basic tool handling.

*Wen Yang,Junhong Wu,Chong Li,Chengqing Zong,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了英语强化后训练（RPT）获得的大模型推理能力是否能有效迁移到其他语言，发现跨语言迁移性存在显著差异，并提出并行训练方法显著提升跨语言推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注RL推理在任务或模态间的泛化，而本研究从跨语言角度探讨推理泛化，检验英语RPT获得的推理能力是否适用于其他语言。

Method: 系统评估以英语为中心的大模型在多语言推理基准上的表现，引入量化跨语言迁移性的指标，并进行干预研究和并行训练实验。

Result: 发现跨语言迁移性受初始模型、目标语言和训练范式影响；提出"并行跳跃"现象、"并行缩放定律"和"单语泛化差距"三个关键发现。

Conclusion: 英语中心的大模型未能完全实现跨语言泛化，挑战了LRM推理与人类认知相似的假设，为开发更语言无关的大模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased
interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has
primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or
modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to
investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question:
$\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively
transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating
English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a
metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that
cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target
language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that
models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on
English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization.
To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental
results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial
leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single
parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing
that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of
training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between
actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as
$\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs
fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption
that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the
development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Motivation: 解决现有顶级嵌入模型需要大规模对比预训练、复杂训练流程和昂贵合成数据的问题，提供更经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 直接从基础模型微调，使用600万个从开源非合成数据集中筛选的查询-文档-负样本三元组进行训练。

Abstract: We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of
state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike
previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive
pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training
data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million
query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic
datasets, striking a strong balance between training cost, model size, and
embedding performance. On the MTEB English leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前LLM竞技场评估中将平局视为模型实力相等的做法，提出平局更多反映查询难度而非模型能力，建议忽略平局时的评分更新能提高预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有LLM竞技场评估范式，质疑平局是否真正意味着两个模型实力相等，认为平局更多与查询难度相关。

Method: 在三个真实世界竞技场数据集上，研究忽略平局时的评分更新对四种评分系统的影响，分析平局与查询特性的关系。

Result: 忽略平局评分更新使战斗结果预测准确率相对提高1-3%，平局更易出现在非常容易和高度客观的查询中，风险比分别为1.37和1.35。

Conclusion: 建议未来的评分系统重新考虑平局的语义，并在评分更新中考虑查询特性。

Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond
to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the
"battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The
prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as
two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its
derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,
we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and
hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that
draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then
both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena
datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative
increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all
four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for
queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of
1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider
existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学推理方面表现出色，但依赖闭源API存在隐私问题，从头训练开源模型计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用半自动数据合成流程生成多样化运筹学问题-答案对，微调Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct模型，并集成外部求解器来生成API调用。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中的三个上，OR-Toolformer达到80.1%的执行准确率，比同等规模基线高出4.3%以上；在两种未见过的运筹学问题类型上，零样本评估达到54%的平均准确率，比最强基线提高21个百分点。

Conclusion: 工具增强的微调方法对于准确且可泛化的运筹学问题建模和求解是有效的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical reasoning, but
reliance on closed-source APIs for OR tasks raises privacy concerns, and
training open-source models from scratch incurs high compute costs. We
introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a
semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer
pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On
three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution
accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot
evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a
21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline. These findings
validate the efficacy of tool-augmented fine-tuning LLMs for accurate and
generalizable OR problem modeling and solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类行为建模方法要么对理性做出不切实际的假设，要么计算成本过高难以快速适应。日常社交互动往往遵循可预测的认知节省模式。

Method: 将日常行为建模为计算机代码形式的行为程序，使用LLM合成行为程序的假设空间，结合概率推理处理不确定性。

Result: 在网格世界任务和家庭模拟器中测试，ROTE比行为克隆和LLM方法在样本内准确性和样本外泛化能力上提升高达50%。

Conclusion: 将动作理解视为程序合成问题，为AI系统在现实世界中高效预测人类行为开辟了新路径。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe
human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are
often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions
about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our
key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable
patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and
observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these
routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than
policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel
algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a
hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for
reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of
gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts
human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive
baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as
50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By
treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path
for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the
real-world.

Method: 集成领域知识库、知识增强技术和协作智能体，构建多智能体协作系统，引入具备本体工程能力的协作智能体来提升跨领域合作效率。

Result: 知识库增强机制使7个专家智能体的对话质量评分平均提高10-15%，协作智能体的干预使远领域专家对的效率提升8.5%，而近领域对仅提升0.8%，揭示了知识库差距导致的协作效率递减效应。

Conclusion: 精心设计的多智能体架构为化学工程中的自主科学发现提供了可行路径，展示了知识库增强和协作机制在解决跨学科挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated
substantial potential in chemical engineering, yet existing AI systems remain
limited in interdisciplinary collaboration and exploration of uncharted
problems. To address these issues, we present the Cyber Academia-Chemical
Engineering (CA-ChemE) system, a living digital town that enables self-directed
research evolution and emergent scientific discovery through multi-agent
collaboration. By integrating domain-specific knowledge bases, knowledge
enhancement technologies, and collaboration agents, the system successfully
constructs an intelligent ecosystem capable of deep professional reasoning and
efficient interdisciplinary collaboration. Our findings demonstrate that
knowledge base-enabled enhancement mechanisms improved dialogue quality scores
by 10-15% on average across all seven expert agents, fundamentally ensuring
technical judgments are grounded in verifiable scientific evidence. However, we
observed a critical bottleneck in cross-domain collaboration efficiency,
prompting the introduction of a Collaboration Agent (CA) equipped with ontology
engineering capabilities. CA's intervention achieved 8.5% improvements for
distant-domain expert pairs compared to only 0.8% for domain-proximate pairs -
a 10.6-fold difference - unveiling the "diminished collaborative efficiency
caused by knowledge-base gaps" effect. This study demonstrates how carefully
designed multi-agent architectures can provide a viable pathway toward
autonomous scientific discovery in chemical engineering.

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖的多智能体辩论评估框架，用于发现和量化LLM智能体在交互环境中的涌现社会行为，特别是共识寻求倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估基准无法捕捉智能体在交互环境中产生的涌现社会认知动态，需要新的评估方法来理解下一代AI智能体的社会行为。

Method: 使用多智能体辩论作为受控"社会实验室"，让具有不同角色和激励的LLM智能体在LLM主持人的监督下就各种挑战性话题进行辩论，并采用新的心理测量和语义指标进行分析。

Result: 发现智能体具有强大的共识寻求倾向（语义一致性μ>0.88），分配的角色会产生稳定的心理测量特征，主持人的角色能显著改变辩论结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为面向智能体场景的动态、基于心理测量的评估协议提供了蓝图，为理解和塑造下一代AI智能体的社会行为提供了关键方法。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous
agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on
downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the
emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate,
persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a
controlled "social laboratory" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our
framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and
incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the
supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of
psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across
hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for
agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\mu}
> 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show
that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles,
particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can
significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key
finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new
class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for
the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and
shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have
released the code and results at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGILE通过将拼图任务构建为交互式学习过程，显著提升了视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力，在2×2拼图任务中准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%，并在9个通用视觉任务上平均提升3.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态理解和推理方面虽有进步，但在基本感知和推理能力上仍有限制，特别是在简单拼图任务上表现接近随机，且高质量视觉语言数据的稀缺性限制了模型能力的提升。

Method: 提出AGILE方法，将拼图解决构建为交互过程，模型在每一步生成可执行代码执行动作，环境提供细粒度视觉反馈，通过观察和交互的迭代循环，模型通过探索和反馈逐步提升感知和推理能力。

Result: AGILE在复杂度不同的拼图任务上显著提升性能（2×2设置下准确率从9.5%提升至82.8%），并在9个通用视觉任务上表现出强泛化能力，平均提升3.1%。

Conclusion: AGILE为推进多模态模型的推理和泛化能力开辟了新途径，并为多模态强化学习数据稀缺问题提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and
reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks,
existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception
and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance
these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant
constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction
Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE
formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to
progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates
executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the
environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion.
Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model
incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via
exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only
substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g.,
increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also
demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an
average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in
both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for
advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an
efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement
learning data. The code and datasets is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上下文和记忆基准测试主要关注对话场景，但企业动态环境中的记忆评估需求至关重要，需要超越对话设置的记忆增强代理评估框架。

Method: 通过专家手动设计和基于代理的可扩展合成来策划MEMTRACK数据集，生成基于真实软件开发过程的生态有效场景，引入正确性、效率和冗余性相关指标。

Result: 在SoTA LLM和记忆后端上的实验显示，在长时程利用记忆、处理跨平台依赖关系和解决矛盾方面存在挑战，性能最佳的GPT-5模型在MEMTRACK上仅达到60%的正确性得分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为记忆增强代理的评估研究提供了可扩展框架，超越了现有对话设置的关注，为复杂组织环境中的多代理、多平台记忆基准测试奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on
conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic
enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce
MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking
in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational
workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and
productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance
provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy,
conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential
codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark
tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict
resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven
design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid
scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce
pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the
effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments
across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory
across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving
contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\%
Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for
advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing
focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent,
multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策复杂性增加和电子健康记录快速扩展带来了数据驱动护理的机遇与挑战，需要辅助工具来增强而非替代临床医生的判断。

Method: 使用检索增强生成(RAG)管道，整合自然语言处理和结构化临床输入，通过检索具有相似特征的先例病例来生成上下文相关的治疗建议。

Result: 初步评估显示，在适当约束和严格验证下，基于LLM的工具可能在处方工作流程中提供有价值的决策支持。

Conclusion: 这是将生成式AI整合到现实世界临床决策中的初步尝试，强调透明度、安全性和与既定实践的一致性。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid
expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and
challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical
decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist
prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by
analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting
complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories.
The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical
inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing
clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and
synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local
datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs
a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured
narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the
system's technical components, including representation representation
alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with
de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical
plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest
that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing
workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work
represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world
clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and
alignment with established practices.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE方法来检测隐式奖励黑客行为，通过截断思维链测量模型通过验证器所需的最小努力，从而识别利用漏洞的捷径行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励黑客行为（模型利用奖励函数漏洞获得高分但不解决实际任务）是一个严重威胁，特别是隐式黑客行为会绕过现有的思维链监控。

Method: TRACE方法逐步截断模型的思维链，强制模型在截断点回答，测量每个截断长度下通过验证器的比例。黑客模型只需少量思维链就能获得高通过率，表现为准确率-长度曲线下的大面积。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，TRACE比最强的72B思维链监控器提升超过65%；在编程任务中，比32B监控器提升超过30%。还能在训练中发现未知漏洞。

Conclusion: TRACE提供了一种可扩展的无监督监督方法，在当前监控方法失效的情况下有效检测隐式奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward
function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a
significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the
model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus
bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE
(Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking
occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task.
This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high
reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning
becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT
at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing
rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a
high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area
under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our
strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B
monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes
during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for
oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

*Humaid Ibrahim,Nikolai Rozanov,Marek Rei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过知识蒸馏将推理时检索转化为学习能力，消除LLM智能体在复杂任务中对运行时检索的依赖，提高性能同时减少计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在多步任务中经常出现可预测的失败，如尝试不满足前提条件的操作、发出冗余命令或错误处理环境约束。虽然检索增强生成(RAG)可以通过提供运行时指导来改善性能，但需要维护外部知识库并在每次部署时增加计算开销

Method: 提出三步蒸馏管道：(1)从智能体失败中提取紧凑、可重用的提示；(2)使用这些提示在情节开始时通过一次性检索生成改进的教师轨迹；(3)在移除提示字符串的情况下训练学生模型，强制内化而非记忆

Result: 在两个交互式基准测试中，蒸馏后的学生模型始终优于基线智能体：在ALFWorld上达到91%成功率（基线为79%），在WebShop上得分提高到72（基线为61），同时比检索增强教师少使用10-60%的token

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模（7B/14B参数）和智能体架构（ReAct/StateAct）上都具有通用性，证明检索优势可以通过有针对性的微调有效内化，无需永久性的运行时依赖

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently
fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing
redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing
runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds
computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that
converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation.
Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2)
uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot
retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories
with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization.
Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop
(online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents,
achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving
WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens
than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach
generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures
(ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively
internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime
dependencies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出使用LLM代理自动进行数据驱动建模和分析的管道，特别关注回归任务，在临界热通量预测基准测试中表现优于传统方法，达到与专家开发的模型相当的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代工程依赖大量实验和模拟数据，需要高效可靠的建模策略。传统数据驱动方法需要大量人工干预，难以扩展和泛化到不同应用。

Method: 评估两种LLM代理框架：多代理协作系统和基于ReAct范式的单代理系统，自动处理数据预处理、神经网络开发、训练、超参数优化和不确定性量化。

Result: 在包含约25,000个实验数据点的临界热通量预测基准测试中，LLM代理开发的模型超越传统查找表，预测精度和不确定性量化与专家开发的贝叶斯优化深度神经网络模型相当。

Conclusion: LLM代理在自动化复杂工程建模任务方面具有巨大潜力，能显著减少人工工作量，同时达到或超越现有预测性能标准。

Abstract: Modern engineering increasingly relies on vast datasets generated by
experiments and simulations, driving a growing demand for efficient, reliable,
and broadly applicable modeling strategies. There is also heightened interest
in developing data-driven approaches, particularly neural network models, for
effective prediction and analysis of scientific datasets. Traditional
data-driven methods frequently involve extensive manual intervention, limiting
their ability to scale effectively and generalize to diverse applications. In
this study, we propose an innovative pipeline utilizing Large Language Model
(LLM) agents to automate data-driven modeling and analysis, with a particular
emphasis on regression tasks. We evaluate two LLM-agent frameworks: a
multi-agent system featuring specialized collaborative agents, and a
single-agent system based on the Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) paradigm. Both
frameworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,
training, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We
validate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,
involving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA
benchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model
surpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ
on par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models
developed by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential
of LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly
reducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of
predictive performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntoLogX是一个自主AI代理，利用大语言模型将原始系统日志转换为基于本体的知识图谱，通过RAG和迭代校正确保生成的KG语法和语义有效，并能将日志证据映射到MITRE ATT&CK战术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统日志是宝贵的网络威胁情报来源，但由于缺乏结构、语义不一致和跨设备碎片化，其效用受到限制。需要能够将噪声异构数据协调为连贯可互操作表示的方法。

Method: 集成轻量级日志本体与检索增强生成(RAG)和迭代校正步骤，确保生成的KG有效；聚合KG到会话并使用LLM预测MITRE ATT&CK战术，将低级日志证据链接到高级对抗目标。

Result: 在公共基准和真实世界蜜罐数据集上评估，展示了跨多个KG后端的稳健KG生成，以及将对抗活动准确映射到ATT&CK战术的能力。检索和校正提高了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 基于本体的表示为可操作的CTI提取提供了价值，代码导向模型在结构化日志分析中有效，检索和校正机制对精度和召回率有显著益处。

Abstract: System logs represent a valuable source of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI),
capturing attacker behaviors, exploited vulnerabilities, and traces of
malicious activity. Yet their utility is often limited by lack of structure,
semantic inconsistency, and fragmentation across devices and sessions.
Extracting actionable CTI from logs therefore requires approaches that can
reconcile noisy, heterogeneous data into coherent and interoperable
representations. We introduce OntoLogX, an autonomous Artificial Intelligence
(AI) agent that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw logs
into ontology-grounded Knowledge Graphs (KGs). OntoLogX integrates a
lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and
semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into
sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level
log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on
both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset,
demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate
mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics. Results highlight the
benefits of retrieval and correction for precision and recall, the
effectiveness of code-oriented models in structured log analysis, and the value
of ontology-grounded representations for actionable CTI extraction.

TL;DR: Falconer是一个结合LLM智能推理与轻量级代理模型的可扩展知识挖掘框架，通过LLM作为规划器和标注器，训练小型代理模型执行分类和提取任务，在保持高准确率的同时大幅降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模知识挖掘中LLM部署成本过高，而传统分类器-提取器流水线又脆弱且无法泛化到新任务的问题。

Method: Falconer框架：LLM作为规划器分解用户指令为可执行流水线，作为标注器生成监督数据训练小型代理模型。统一分类和提取为get label和get span两个原子操作。

Result: Falconer在指令跟随准确率上接近最先进LLM，同时减少推理成本达90%，加速大规模知识挖掘超过20倍。

Conclusion: Falconer为深度研究提供了高效可扩展的基础，平衡了LLM的智能推理能力与轻量级模型的计算效率。

Abstract: At the core of Deep Research is knowledge mining, the task of extracting
structured information from massive unstructured text in response to user
instructions. Large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting such
instructions but are prohibitively expensive to deploy at scale, while
traditional pipelines of classifiers and extractors remain efficient yet
brittle and unable to generalize to new tasks. We introduce Falconer, a
collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with
lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act
as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as
annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework
unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and
get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple
task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models
incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we
construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution.
Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in
instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and
accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an
efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI教育社区经常忽视领域专家提供的精心策划知识在创建有效辅导系统中的作用，本文旨在强调这一主题的重要性。

Method: 1. 使用可解释AI技术自动创建课程：结合专家指定的问题解决规则和新型XAI技术自动生成课程；2. 利用专家指定的学习课程开发自适应辅导系统，提高学习体验和算法效率。

Result: 通过传粉者识别辅导系统的案例研究，展示了这些方法在实际应用中的可行性和重要性。

Conclusion: 领域专家精心策划的知识在开发有效教育系统中具有重要作用，通过结合专家知识和AI技术可以创建更有效的自适应辅导系统。

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could
play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI
for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing
two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel
educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI
(XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are
primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could
use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI
techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to
learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning
a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only
provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more
efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the
importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for
pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from
experts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VOGUE通过将探索从文本输出空间转移到视觉输入空间，将图像视为随机上下文，量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，使用对称KL散度创建不确定性感知探索信号，有效提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理多模态大语言模型时，将视觉输入视为固定、确定性的条件，忽略了视觉变化带来的模糊性，难以构建对合理视觉变化具有鲁棒性的策略。

Method: VOGUE方法将图像视为随机上下文，通过比较"原始"和"噪声"分支之间的对称KL散度来量化策略对视觉扰动的敏感性，创建不确定性感知探索信号。结合不确定性比例奖励、token熵奖励和退火采样计划，有效平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B模型上，VOGUE在三个视觉数学基准测试中平均提升pass@1准确率2.6%，在三个通用领域推理基准测试中提升3.7%，同时提高了pass@4性能并缓解了RL微调中常见的探索衰减问题。

Conclusion: 基于视觉输入固有不确定性的探索策略是改善多模态推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in
large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that
still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual
input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of
ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual
variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided
Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text)
to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context,
VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the
symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct
signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning
objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a
token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances
exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales
(Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three
visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks,
while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the
exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that
grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an
effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着政府对AI的监管加强，需要评估LLM在AI法规合规性判断方面的能力，但目前缺乏相应的基准测试工具。

Method: 通过两步流程创建数据集：(1)使用结构化指令提示LLM生成120个技术文档样本；(2)法律专家审查并标注每个样本违反AI法案的具体条款。

Result: 创建了AIReg-Bench数据集，并评估了前沿LLM在重现专家合规标签方面的表现，为理解LLM在AI法规合规评估中的机会和局限性提供了起点。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在AI法规合规评估中的应用建立了基准，数据集和评估代码已开源，可供后续LLM模型比较使用。

Abstract: As governments move to regulate AI, there is growing interest in using Large
Language Models (LLMs) to assess whether or not an AI system complies with a
given AI Regulation (AIR). However, there is presently no way to benchmark the
performance of LLMs at this task. To fill this void, we introduce AIReg-Bench:
the first benchmark dataset designed to test how well LLMs can assess
compliance with the EU AI Act (AIA). We created this dataset through a two-step
process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we
generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a
fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might
produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then
reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI
system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting
dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce
the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the
opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and
establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LToT通过分离效用与逻辑一致性，将低效用但一致的候选视为资产而非浪费，采用横向竞赛机制在宽泛的候选集中进行廉价探测，解决搜索中的广度饱和和深度短视问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代部署中大量测试时计算资源常导致标准思维树搜索出现广度饱和（额外样本产生近似重复）和深度短视（噪声短期效用修剪有长期回报的分支）两大问题。

Method: 提出横向思维树（LToT），将前沿分为主线（高效用候选用于开发）和横向（一致但初始低效用候选），通过带短路机制的横向竞赛（LR-SC）进行探索，采用宽度感知阈值和重复确认机制。

Result: 理论证明横向成本为伪线性Θ(N₀log_ηN₀)，与未加限制的主线指数增长形成对比，实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: LToT将大量测试时预算转化为有原则的多样性，同时保持提升纪律，在不增加计算成本的情况下缓解饱和和短视问题。

Abstract: Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands
of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets,
standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth
saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops
growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose
payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts
(LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency
and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste.
The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for
exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that
receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via
Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race
that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware
thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its
envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so
surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear
lateral cost $\Theta(N_0 \log_{\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs
(initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\eta>1$), in contrast to the
exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark
tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT
turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving
promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating
compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在数学推理任务中的内部表示机制，旨在通过平衡利用和探索来提高推理质量。

Method: 首先训练稀疏自编码器生成训练标记的稀疏向量表示，然后应用k-means聚类构建图结构，其中顶点表示标记簇，加权边捕获顺序标记转换。基于边权重定义奖励函数来量化对已建立推理轨迹的遵循程度。

Result: 研究发现平衡利用和探索对于在数学推理任务中实现高准确率至关重要。稀疏自编码器可以作为可扩展的奖励模型来指导生成过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能够防止极端行为，在利用和探索之间实现平衡，最终促进大语言模型中更高质量的推理过程。

Abstract: We propose a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and
clustering techniques to analyze the internal token representations of large
language models (LLMs) and guide generations in mathematical reasoning tasks.
Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for
training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where
vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token
transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function
to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying
exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation
diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings
indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for
achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the
SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a
balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme
behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning
process in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出LOGicalThought (LogT)神经符号架构，结合逻辑语言推理器和LLM构建双上下文表示，将长文本推理转化为紧凑的接地评估，在四个多领域基准测试中性能提升11.84%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 关键领域（如法律和医学）需要准确、可验证且明确基于证据的推理，但LLM在标准推理任务中的能力无法满足高保证文本指南的严格推理要求，特别是涉及可废止逻辑和例外的情况。

Method: 使用高级逻辑语言和推理器与LLM结合，构建符号图上下文和基于逻辑的上下文双表示，将长文本指南推理问题转化为紧凑的接地评估。

Result: 在四个多领域基准测试中，相比四个基线模型，LogT整体性能提升11.84%，在否定推理上提升达10.2%，蕴含推理提升13.2%，可废止推理提升5.5%。

Conclusion: LogT神经符号架构有效解决了高保证文本推理中的逻辑挑战，显著提升了LLM在复杂逻辑推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and
medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly
grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules,
statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic
due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can
invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language
models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in
standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required
over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such
texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation,
implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this
paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called
LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in
conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and
logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem
from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation.
Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves
overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves
significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation,
+13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the
strongest baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划代理在处理观测不确定性时，往往忽略了内部动态与实际环境之间的差异，这限制了它们在部分可观测环境中的表现。

Method: 提出InfoSeeker框架，提示LLM主动收集信息，通过规划行动来验证理解、检测环境变化或测试假设，然后再生成或修订任务导向计划。

Result: 在包含不完全观测和不确定动态的部分可观测环境基准测试中，InfoSeeker相比现有方法实现了74%的绝对性能提升，且在机器人操作和网页导航等基准测试中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 在部分可观测环境中，紧密集成规划和信息寻求对于实现鲁棒行为至关重要，InfoSeeker框架展示了这种集成方法的有效性。

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in
practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy
dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans
seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future
decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents
have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies
between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce
Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making
framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to
align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both
agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to
actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding,
detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising
task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark
suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations
and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74%
absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample
efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms
baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web
navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating
planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable
environments. The project page is available at https://infoseekerllm.github.io

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的扩散语言模型训练依赖稀疏的结果奖励，会强化错误的推理路径但偶然正确的答案，这与推理的自然结构不匹配。

Method: 提出理论框架将复杂问题解决形式化为层次选择过程，并开发SAPO算法，使用过程奖励函数引导模型学习结构化推理路径。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在挑战性推理基准上显著提升性能，并增强生成过程的可解释性。

Conclusion: 基于理论框架的SAPO算法有效解决了扩散语言模型在复杂推理训练中的核心问题，实现了更好的推理性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) offer a promising, non-autoregressive
paradigm for text generation, yet training them for complex reasoning remains a
key challenge. Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to
coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental
mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a
theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical
selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a
series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a
principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into
the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this
theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's
iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core
deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising
process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward
function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn
structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this
principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning
benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.

TL;DR: InvThink是一种让大语言模型具备逆向思维能力的方法，通过预先分析潜在危害及其后果来生成更安全的响应，在安全性和通用推理能力方面都表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法直接优化安全响应，但缺乏对潜在风险的系统性分析。InvThink旨在通过逆向思维让模型在生成响应前先考虑可能的失败模式。

Method: 通过三个步骤实现逆向思维：1) 枚举潜在危害，2) 分析后果，3) 生成主动避免这些风险的安全输出。方法通过监督微调和强化学习在三个LLM家族中实现。

Result: 相比SafetyPrompt等基线方法，InvThink在有害响应方面减少高达15.7%，在外部风险场景（医疗、金融、法律）和代理风险场景（勒索、谋杀）中表现优异，同时保持标准基准的通用推理能力。

Conclusion: 逆向推理为构建更安全、更强大的语言模型提供了一条可扩展且通用的路径，安全改进随模型规模扩大而增强，并减轻了安全税问题。

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language
models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure
modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods
that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1)
enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe
outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key
findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size
compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by
training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general
reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety
tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing
(medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios,
achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline
methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised
fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These
results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable
path toward safer, more capable language models.

Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统在规划、工具使用和角色协调方面表现出色，但其开放性和交互复杂性使其容易受到越狱、提示注入和对抗性协作攻击。现有防御方法存在性能不足或系统开销大的问题。

Method: 提出AdvEvo-MARL框架，通过对抗学习环境联合优化攻击者（合成进化越狱提示）和防御者（训练任务智能体完成任务并抵抗攻击）。引入公共基线优势估计，同一功能组内的智能体共享组级平均回报基线，实现低方差更新和强组内协调。

Conclusion: 安全性和实用性可以在不依赖额外防护智能体或增加系统开销的情况下共同提升，AdvEvo-MARL为多智能体系统提供了有效的内部化安全解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role
coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to
jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses
fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter
unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that
police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent
lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and
delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a
single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and
adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we
propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning
framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on
external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize
evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both
accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning
environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a
public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional
group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates
and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios,
AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas
baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task
accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and
utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added
system overhead.

Motivation: 现有交互式对话推荐系统在处理动态用户偏好、保持对话连贯性和平衡多个排序目标方面存在显著挑战。

Method: 采用分层智能体网络，包含对话理解、偏好建模、上下文感知和动态排序等专门LLM智能体，通过自适应权重机制协调，结合三层学习策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，AgentRec在对话成功率提升2.8%、推荐准确率(NDCG@10)提升1.9%、对话效率提升3.2%，同时保持可比较的计算成本。

Conclusion: AgentRec通过智能体协作有效解决了现有对话推荐系统的关键挑战，实现了性能的全面提升。

Abstract: Interactive conversational recommender systems have gained significant
attention for their ability to capture user preferences through natural
language interactions. However, existing approaches face substantial challenges
in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and
balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces
AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative
recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical
agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized
LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context
awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting
mechanism that learns from interaction patterns. We propose a three-tier
learning strategy combining rapid response for simple queries, intelligent
reasoning for complex preferences, and deep collaboration for challenging
scenarios. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
AgentRec achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with
2.8\% enhancement in conversation success rate, 1.9\% improvement in
recommendation accuracy (NDCG@10), and 3.2\% better conversation efficiency
while maintaining comparable computational costs through intelligent agent
coordination.

TL;DR: 本文评估大型语言模型在心理咨询领域的应用潜力，通过PsychoBench基准测试（基于美国国家咨询师认证考试）发现只有前沿LLMs能达到合格标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在需要认知能力的应用（如心理咨询）中的潜力，评估其是否具备担任心理咨询师所需的知识资格。

Method: 开发PsychoBench基准，包含约2,252道精心设计的单选题，基于美国国家咨询师认证考试，要求约70%准确率才能通过。

Result: GPT-4o、Llama3.3-70B和Gemma3-27B等先进模型远超合格阈值，而较小的开源模型（如Qwen2.5-7B、Mistral-7B）远低于标准。

Conclusion: 只有前沿LLMs目前能够达到心理咨询考试标准，这凸显了开发心理学导向LLMs的潜力和挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a
wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative
abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities,
such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper
investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological
counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a
psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the
qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.
National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human
counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate
sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a
role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in
U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional
counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises
approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to
require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of
psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's
ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models
such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing
threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B)
remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are
currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the
promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论的上下文马尔可夫决策过程(CMDP)方法，使用LLM压缩高维上下文为低维语义摘要，提升决策效率并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CMDP方法在高维或非结构化上下文中泛化能力差，导致计算量大且性能不稳定，需要更高效的上下文处理方法。

Method: 使用LLM对上下文输入进行信息论压缩，生成低维语义摘要来增强状态表示，基于近似上下文充分性理论提供遗憾界和延迟-熵权衡分析。

Result: 在离散、连续、视觉和推荐基准测试中，该方法在奖励、成功率、样本效率方面优于原始上下文和非上下文基线，同时降低延迟和内存使用。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的摘要技术为上下文丰富、资源受限环境中的高效决策提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential
decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to
generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive
computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic
summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress
contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These
summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing
redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we
provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy
trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how
informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete,
continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method
outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success
rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These
findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich,
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在空间推理方面的能力，特别是能否理解道路网络地图并执行导航任务。

Method: 将轨迹恢复作为代理任务，使用包含4000多条真实轨迹的GLOBALTRACE数据集，通过提示框架让LLMs基于道路网络生成有效路径。

Result: LLMs在轨迹恢复任务中优于现成基线和专业模型，表现出对道路网络和坐标系统的强大理解能力，但也存在区域和交通模式的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs能够通过灵活推理地图来增强导航体验，并整合用户偏好。

Abstract: We explore the geospatial reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), specifically, whether LLMs can read road network maps and perform
navigation. We frame trajectory recovery as a proxy task, which requires models
to reconstruct masked GPS traces, and introduce GLOBALTRACE, a dataset with
over 4,000 real-world trajectories across diverse regions and transportation
modes. Using road network as context, our prompting framework enables LLMs to
generate valid paths without accessing any external navigation tools.
Experiments show that LLMs outperform off-the-shelf baselines and specialized
trajectory recovery models, with strong zero-shot generalization. Fine-grained
analysis shows that LLMs have strong comprehension of the road network and
coordinate systems, but also pose systematic biases with respect to regions and
transportation modes. Finally, we demonstrate how LLMs can enhance navigation
experiences by reasoning over maps in flexible ways to incorporate user
preferences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了计算机使用代理(CUAs)中的盲目目标导向(BGD)问题，即代理会不顾可行性、安全性、可靠性和上下文地追求目标。作者开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试来评估BGD，并在9个前沿模型上观察到80.8%的平均BGD率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理(CUAs)在GUI上执行操作以实现用户目标，但存在盲目追求目标的风险，这可能带来安全性、可靠性和上下文理解问题。

Method: 开发了BLIND-ACT基准测试，包含90个任务，捕获三种BGD模式：缺乏上下文推理、在模糊性下做出假设和决策、矛盾或不可行的目标。基于OSWorld构建，使用LLM评估代理行为。

Result: 在9个前沿模型上测试，平均BGD率达到80.8%。基于提示的干预措施降低了BGD水平，但仍有显著风险。观察到三种失败模式：执行优先偏见、思维-行动脱节、请求优先性。

Conclusion: 识别BGD和引入BLIND-ACT为未来研究和缓解这种基本风险奠定了基础，确保CUA的安全部署。需要更强的训练或推理时干预措施。

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that
take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs
consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals
regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize
three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)
assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or
infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these
three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and
employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement
with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,
including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing
high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle
risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While
prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,
highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.
Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias
(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect
(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions
due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a
foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk
and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Result: 在拔牙和胃镜检查两个领域测试，E5-large-instruct模型达到0.983准确率，AUC 0.996，能耗仅为生成式模型的1/170。

Conclusion: 通过返回经过验证的FAQ答案，可以在临床路径中避免生成错误，支持隐私保护、可持续性和在带宽有限环境中的公平部署。

Abstract: Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural
questions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit
personalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave
No One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes
inputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns
verbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating
free-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth
extraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets
(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among
the four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of
0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were
statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors
on this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path
consumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local
8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single
on-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and
generation-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by
returning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and
equitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.

Motivation: 当前AGI评估方法主要基于对智能的直觉理解来设计合成任务，这种方法在AI历史上表现不佳，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 提出一种替代的设计哲学，专注于评估稳健的任务执行能力，借鉴数据科学中展示系统可靠部署的实践方法。

Result: 提供了这种新评估哲学的实际应用示例，展示了如何通过能力证明来评估AGI。

Conclusion: AGI评估应该从基于直觉的任务设计转向基于能力证明的稳健任务执行评估，这能更有效地展示系统的AGI潜力。

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the
breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of
the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to
provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we
argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy
that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks,
that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an
alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that
seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from
common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be
reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for
AGI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好微调方法忽视了合成偏好标注中普遍存在的风格和长度偏差噪声问题，需要开发能够产生高质量硬负样本的方法来改善LVLM的对齐效果。

Method: 基于LLM引导的响应编辑框架，生成具有目标错误但保持风格和长度相似性的拒绝响应，构建VaPR数据集用于微调LVLM模型。

Result: 在三个LVLM家族（LLaVA-V1.5、Qwen2VL、Qwen2.5VL）上平均性能提升分别为6.5%、4.0%和1.5%，在推理任务上表现尤为突出，同时减少了二元问题中回答"是"的倾向。

Conclusion: VaPR框架有效解决了合成偏好标注中的噪声问题，显著提升了LVLM的性能，且该框架可推广到使用开源LLM作为编辑器，性能接近使用GPT-4o合成的版本。

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with
AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook
the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of
stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response
generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces
rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length
similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR
dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families:
LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver
significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average
gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable
improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance
consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at
smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary
questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we
show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models
trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on
\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o. Our data, models, and code can be

Motivation: 解决代谢组学知识图谱使用中的技术障碍，传统方法需要深入理解本体论和查询语言语法，限制了研究人员的访问和使用。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，使用LangChain和LangGraph库集成LLM与外部工具，通过专门的智能体处理用户查询、验证问题、识别需求、提取实体信息并生成SPARQL查询。

Result: 在50个代谢组学相关问题的测试中，MetaboT达到83.67%的准确率，显著优于仅使用标准LLM的基线方法（8.16%准确率）。

Conclusion: MetaboT成功消除了知识图谱访问的技术障碍，通过自然语言交互实现了实验数据驱动的发现，为研究人员提供了用户友好的代谢组学数据检索工具。

Abstract: Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring
advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges
by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their
relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective
use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and
its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system
utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL
semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).
We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products
Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural
products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for
handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down
complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent
(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and
LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external
tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process
follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the
question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are
forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to
the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,
which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized
identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph
Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or
taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent
responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the
knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the
system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph
and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance
of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected
answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a
baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that
incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity
IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,
underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving
entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising
performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling
researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language
queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it
removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge
graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while
maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs
remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This
approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between
complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction. MetaboT is

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, structured decision support framework that
systematically aligns diverse artificial intelligence (AI) agent architectures,
reactive, cognitive, hybrid, and learning, with the comprehensive National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0.
By integrating agent theory with industry guidelines, this framework provides a
transparent and stepwise methodology for selecting and deploying AI solutions
to address contemporary cyber threats. Employing a granular decomposition of
NIST CSF 2.0 functions into specific tasks, the study links essential AI agent
properties such as autonomy, adaptive learning, and real-time responsiveness to
each subcategory's security requirements. In addition, it outlines graduated
levels of autonomy (assisted, augmented, and fully autonomous) to accommodate
organisations at varying stages of cybersecurity maturity. This holistic
approach transcends isolated AI applications, providing a unified detection,
incident response, and governance strategy. Through conceptual validation, the
framework demonstrates how tailored AI agent deployments can align with
real-world constraints and risk profiles, enhancing situational awareness,
accelerating response times, and fortifying long-term resilience via adaptive
risk management. Ultimately, this research bridges the gap between theoretical
AI constructs and operational cybersecurity demands, establishing a foundation

*Clara Maathuis,Kasper Cools*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种可信赖的协同学习模型，用于军事行动中的人机协作，包含可调节自治、多层控制、双向反馈和协作决策四个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速演变的军事威胁和复杂作战环境中，AI集成到军事行动中具有显著优势，但也面临有效和道德部署人机协作系统的挑战。目前多从外部视角处理，而深入系统内部动态能处理更广泛的多维责任、安全和鲁棒性方面。

Method: 设计可信赖的协同学习模型，整合四个维度：可调节自治（根据任务状态、系统信心和环境不确定性动态校准自治水平）、多层控制（持续监督、活动监控和问责）、双向反馈（显性和隐性反馈回路确保推理、不确定性和学习适应的适当沟通）、协作决策（生成、评估和提议决策，附带置信水平和理由）。

Result: 提出了具体示例和建议，有助于进一步开发负责任和可信赖的军事行动人机协作系统。

Conclusion: 该模型通过四个维度的整合，为人机协作系统在军事行动中的可信赖部署提供了框架，促进了持续双向的知识交换和共同适应。

Abstract: In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex
operational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves
significant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and
risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective
and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often
tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as
a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the
system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional
responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research
proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in
military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of
insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving
battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,
adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents
depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental
uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,
monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback
with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper
communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of
the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the
generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence
levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete
exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing
responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PTA-GRPO框架，通过两阶段方法改进LLM的推理能力：第一阶段利用高级LLM提炼紧凑的高层指导进行监督微调；第二阶段引入指导感知的强化学习方法联合优化最终输出和高层指导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM的推理过程受限于自回归的token级生成，缺乏全局规划，导致推理冗余、不连贯或不准确，现有方法计算成本高且难以产生最优推理轨迹。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用高级LLM将CoT提炼为紧凑高层指导进行SFT；2) 提出指导感知RL方法联合优化最终输出和指导质量。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，包括MATH、AIME2024、AIME2025和AMC，使用不同基础模型均实现了稳定且显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PTA-GRPO能够有效提升LLM的推理能力，在不同模型和任务上表现出良好的有效性和泛化性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However,
due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is
largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This
limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate
reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing
approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL),
attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and
often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge,
we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy
Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both
high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we
leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which
is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we
introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output
and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning
effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across
diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and
LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently
achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks,
validating its effectiveness and generalization.

TL;DR: 该论文将对抗性逆强化学习应用于大语言模型推理，学习密集的token级奖励模型用于过程监督，而非通过监督微调模仿风格。该推理奖励在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为评论家重新排序采样轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新构建和操作化对抗性逆强化学习到大语言模型推理中，直接从专家演示中学习密集的token级奖励模型，而不是通过监督微调模仿风格。

Method: 使用对抗性逆强化学习方法学习密集的token级推理奖励模型，该模型在训练时提供步骤级反馈优化推理策略，在推理时作为评论家重新排序采样轨迹。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上使用Llama3和Qwen2.5骨干网络，证明：(i)密集推理奖励可用作学习信号来引发推理；(ii)通过奖励引导的重新排序提高了预测性能（特别是基于Llama的策略）。

Conclusion: 通过将训练信号、推理时选择和token级诊断统一到单一推理奖励中，这项工作表明可重用的过程级奖励具有增强语言模型中多步推理的广泛潜力。

Abstract: We reframe and operationalise adversarial inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL) to large language model reasoning, learning a dense, token-level reward
model for process supervision directly from expert demonstrations rather than
imitating style via supervised fine-tuning. The learned reasoning reward serves
two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a
reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a
critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate
that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores
that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable
localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and
Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a
learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is
improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies). By
unifying training signals, inference-time selection, and token-level
diagnostics into a single reasoning reward, this work suggests reusable
process-level rewards with broad potential to enhance multi-step reasoning in
language models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CARS方法，在保持语言模型分布不变的前提下，通过自适应剪枝提高约束生成的采样效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有约束生成方法存在两极化问题：贪婪约束解码会扭曲语言模型分布，而拒绝采样虽然保持分布但计算效率低下。在程序模糊测试等需要有效性和多样性的领域，这两种方法都有问题

Method: CARS从无约束语言模型采样开始，通过记录约束违反的连续序列到trie结构中，自适应地排除这些路径，从未来采样中减去其概率质量

Result: 在程序模糊测试和分子生成等多个领域的实验中，CARS在采样效率（每个有效样本所需的语言模型前向传递次数）和样本多样性方面都优于GCD和其他近似方法

Conclusion: CARS严格改进了拒绝采样的样本效率，同时不产生分布扭曲，确保生成的样本完全遵循约束分布，且接受率单调提高

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated
outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing
approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained
decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's
distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes
computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in
domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples
are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an
approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without
distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and
adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a
trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive
pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance
rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the
constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g.,
program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher
efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample --
while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that
approximate the LM's distribution.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLMs与人类集体决策对齐的框架，通过"海上求生"实验对比人类和AI在群体决策中的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地用于建模和增强集体决策，需要检验它们与人类社会推理的对齐程度，特别是在集体层面而非个体层面。

Method: 使用"海上求生"社会心理学任务，进行大规模在线实验(N=748)，随机分配组别进行领导者选举，对比可见人口属性与匿名化条件下的表现，并模拟匹配的LLM组别进行基准测试。

Result: 不同LLM行为存在分歧：有些反映人类偏见，有些则掩盖这些偏见并试图补偿。人类-AI对齐在集体推理中取决于情境、线索和模型特定的归纳偏见。

Conclusion: 理解LLMs如何与集体人类行为对齐对于推进社会对齐AI至关重要，需要能够捕捉集体推理复杂性的动态基准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model and augment
collective decision-making, it is critical to examine their alignment with
human social reasoning. We present an empirical framework for assessing
collective alignment, in contrast to prior work on the individual level. Using
the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online
experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either
visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We
then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking
Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some
mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for
them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective
reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases.
Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to
advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the
complexities of collective reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一个确定性模拟框架，为评估AI生成的同行评审报告提供首个稳定的证据基准，通过分析352份模拟报告验证了系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术出版生态系统面临投稿量不可管理和AI不受监管的双重危机，需要新的治理模式来保障科学完整性。传统纯人工同行评审缺乏可扩展的客观基准。

Method: 开发确定性模拟框架，分析352份同行评审模拟报告，识别一致的系统状态指标来验证可靠性。

Result: 系统能够模拟校准的编辑判断，'修订'决策始终占多数(>50%)，'拒绝'率动态适应领域规范；保持稳定的程序完整性，证据锚定合规率稳定在29%。

Conclusion: 该框架将AI重新定位为机构问责的重要组成部分，为维护学术交流信任提供关键基础设施，为科学界提供确保公平的透明工具，为出版策略师提供可扩展的审计工具。

Abstract: The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing
integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance. The framework
repositions AI as an essential component of institutional accountability,
providing the critical infrastructure to maintain trust in scholarly
communication.

TL;DR: ReTabAD是一个为表格异常检测恢复文本语义的基准框架，提供20个带有文本元数据的表格数据集和多种异常检测算法实现，通过零样本LLM框架利用语义上下文提升检测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格异常检测基准缺乏文本语义上下文（如特征描述和领域知识），限制了模型利用领域知识进行检测的能力，而实践中专家依赖这些语义信息。

Method: 提供20个带有结构化文本元数据的表格数据集，实现包括经典、深度学习和LLM方法在内的多种异常检测算法，并开发零样本LLM框架利用语义上下文。

Result: 语义上下文显著提高了异常检测性能，并通过支持领域感知推理增强了结果的可解释性。

Conclusion: ReTabAD为系统探索上下文感知的表格异常检测建立了基准，证明了文本元数据在异常检测中的重要价值。

Abstract: In tabular anomaly detection (AD), textual semantics often carry critical
signals, as the definition of an anomaly is closely tied to domain-specific
context. However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without
semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature
descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This
limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully
leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by
restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We
provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured
textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD
algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and
(2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without
task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research.
Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual
metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic
context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by
supporting domain-aware reasoning. These findings establish ReTabAD as a
benchmark for systematic exploration of context-aware AD.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 对LLM深度层利用的系统研究发现：深度层贡献高度异质且依赖上下文，浅层负责知识和检索，深层对推理至关重要，评估方法显著影响深度层重要性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有研究认为LLM深层对表示学习贡献有限且可被移除的观点，本研究旨在通过系统分析揭示深度层在不同评估设置、任务类别和模型架构中的真实作用。

Method: 采用系统性研究方法，从评估协议（似然度vs生成）、任务类别、模型架构等多个维度分析深度层利用情况，包括层剪枝实验和知识蒸馏分析。

Result: 发现深度层贡献高度异质：在似然度评估中仅需浅层，但在生成评估中中层和深层对推理和长程连贯性至关重要；知识集中在浅层，推理准确性依赖深层但可通过蒸馏重塑。

Conclusion: LLM深度层利用具有高度情境依赖性，强调在解释和压缩大模型时需要任务、度量和模型感知的视角。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the deeper layers of Large Language Models (LLMs)
contribute little to representation learning and can often be removed without
significant performance loss. However, such claims are typically drawn from
narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In
this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse
dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model
architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less
effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with
the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation,
pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being
critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles
for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range
coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in
shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers
-- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth
usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the
need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and
compressing large models.

*Claas Beger,Ryan Yi,Shuhao Fu,Arseny Moskvichev,Sarah W. Tsai,Sivasankaran Rajamanickam,Melanie Mitchell*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明，虽然某些AI模型在文本模态下的输出准确率能达到人类水平，但它们往往依赖表面模式而非真正的抽象推理。在视觉模态下，模型准确率下降但仍有抽象推理能力，只是应用规则的能力不足。仅靠准确率评估会高估文本模态的抽象推理能力，低估视觉模态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查AI模型在ConceptARC任务上的抽象推理能力，评估它们是否真正理解任务设计者意图的抽象概念，而不仅仅是依赖表面模式。

Method: 在ConceptARC基准上评估模型，改变输入模态（文本vs视觉）、是否允许使用Python工具、推理模型的推理努力程度。除了输出准确率，还对模型生成的自然语言解释规则进行细粒度评估。

Result: 文本模态下，最佳模型的输出准确率与人类相当，但生成的规则多基于表面"捷径"，很少捕捉到预期的抽象概念。视觉模态下，模型输出准确率大幅下降，但规则分析显示它们仍能生成相当比例的抽象规则，只是应用能力不足。

Conclusion: AI模型在抽象推理方面仍落后于人类，仅靠准确率评估会误导对模型抽象推理能力的判断。提出的评估框架能更准确地衡量多模态模型的抽象推理能力。

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI
benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with
the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models'
abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that
vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to
use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning
effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained
evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their
solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using
the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on
surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using
text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules
are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended
abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general
abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone.
In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our
rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still
exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but
are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show
that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy
alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate
abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in
visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more
faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more
principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered
intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级文档理解模型需要大量多样化且标注良好的数据集，但传统数据收集方法面临隐私约束、法律限制和高昂的人工标注成本（可达数百万美元）。

Method: 结合随机模式和参数化采样，通过概率建模布局模式、视觉结构和内容变异性，实现可控的大规模多样化文档变体生成。

Result: 在关键信息提取任务中，使用FlexDoc生成的数据可将绝对F1分数提高达11%，同时相比传统硬模板方法减少90%以上的标注工作量。

Conclusion: FlexDoc已在实际部署中加速了企业级文档理解模型的开发，同时显著降低了数据获取和标注成本。

Abstract: Developing document understanding models at enterprise scale requires large,
diverse, and well-annotated datasets spanning a wide range of document types.
However, collecting such data is prohibitively expensive due to privacy
constraints, legal restrictions, and the sheer volume of manual annotation
needed - costs that can scale into millions of dollars. We introduce FlexDoc, a
scalable synthetic data generation framework that combines Stochastic Schemas
and Parameterized Sampling to produce realistic, multilingual semi-structured
documents with rich annotations. By probabilistically modeling layout patterns,
visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled
generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key
Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data
improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets,
while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional
hard-template methods. The solution is in active deployment, where it has
accelerated the development of enterprise-grade document understanding models
while significantly reducing data acquisition and annotation costs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language
models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and
information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents
(DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition,
cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which
markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing
benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and
scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively.
This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation
framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises
214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic
domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support
composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of
long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics
for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive
experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over
web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for
further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability
assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

Motivation: 现有安全技术（外部护栏、推理时指导和训练后对齐）在平衡安全性、实用性和可控性方面存在局限性，需要更动态、模块化的安全控制方法。

Method: 识别安全关键层并升级为稀疏MoE结构，路由器作为软护栏选择性激活原始MLP和安全专家；采用两阶段SFT策略增强安全判别能力；引入安全温度机制实现推理时灵活控制。

Result: 在多个基准测试、基础模型和模型规模上，UpSafe°C实现了对有害和越狱输入的鲁棒安全改进，同时在通用任务上保持竞争力，安全温度机制实现了效用和安全性的帕累托最优边界。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM安全指明新方向：从静态对齐转向动态、模块化和推理感知的控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new
direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular,
and inference-aware control.

Motivation: 尽管RLVR被广泛用于提升大语言模型的推理能力，但近期证据表明它可能反而会缩小推理边界而非扩展，这促使研究者深入分析其学习动态。

Method: 通过理论分析和在多个数学推理基准上的实证研究，揭示了RLVR中的负干扰现象和赢家通吃现象，并提出了针对低概率问题的数据筛选算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent
evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather
than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by
analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain
this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to
solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct
solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the
probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we
uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces
problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while
suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical
and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show
that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL
objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.
Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation
algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving
notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at

*Gonzalo Gonzalez-Pumariega,Vincent Tu,Chih-Lun Lee,Jiachen Yang,Ang Li,Xin Eric Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN) 方法通过生成多个执行轨迹并使用行为叙述进行选择，显著提升了计算机使用代理在复杂任务中的鲁棒性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理在自动化日常数字任务方面具有潜力，但其不可靠性和高方差阻碍了在长期复杂任务中的应用。

Method: bBoN 方法通过生成多个执行轨迹（rollouts），并使用描述代理执行过程的行为叙述来进行轨迹选择，实现广泛探索和原则性轨迹选择。

Result: 在 OSWorld 上达到 69.9% 的新 SOTA，显著超越先前方法，接近人类水平的 72%。在 WindowsAgentArena 和 AndroidWorld 上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 有效扩展计算机使用代理需要结构化的轨迹理解和选择，bBoN 提供了一个实用的框架来实现这一点。

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital
tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to
long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method
that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among
them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables
both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially
improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method
establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming
prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with
comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate
strong generalization results to different operating systems on
WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the
unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective
scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN
provides a practical framework to achieve this.

*Yuxiao Qu,Anikait Singh,Yoonho Lee,Amrith Setlur,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Chelsea Finn,Aviral Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RLAD方法，通过推理抽象来引导模型学习算法化推理过程，包含抽象生成器和解决方案生成器的两玩家RL训练范式


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大模型在推理过程中往往无法持续捕获或重用过程，而是陷入冗长和退化的探索，需要更有效的推理方法

Method: 引入推理抽象概念，训练模型能够为问题提出多个抽象描述，然后通过RL激励在构建解决方案时使用这些抽象信息，形成两玩家RL训练范式

Result: 该方法实现了结构化探索，解耦了抽象提议和解决方案生成的学习信号，并提高了对更难问题的泛化能力

Conclusion: 推理抽象能有效指导有意义的探索，在测试时分配更多计算资源生成抽象比生成更多解决方案更有益于性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions
to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce
answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant
primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them.
While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover
this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large
models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into
verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we
introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of
procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning
successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple
abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a
solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This
results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly
trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup
effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of
abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to
harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to
generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more
solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in
guiding meaningful exploration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出BioX-Bridge框架，通过轻量级桥接网络实现生物信号跨模态知识迁移，大幅减少可训练参数(88-99%)，同时保持或提升迁移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物信号模态间存在相关性，但标注数据有限。现有跨模态知识迁移方法计算开销大，特别是面对大型基础模型时。

Method: 训练轻量级桥接网络对齐基础模型的中间表示，实现跨模态信息流动。包含高效的对齐位置选择策略和灵活的桥接网络架构。

Result: 在多个生物信号模态、任务和数据集上的实验表明，BioX-Bridge显著减少可训练参数，同时保持或优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: BioX-Bridge为生物信号跨模态知识迁移提供了一种高效解决方案，特别适用于大型基础模型场景。

Abstract: Biosignals offer valuable insights into the physiological states of the human
body. Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity,
sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the
holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the
possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal
modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of
health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled
datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and
modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a
promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support
model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on
knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside
student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead.
This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation
models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at
the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for
unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a
lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable
information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically,
we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the
bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the
bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal
modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of
trainable parameters by 88--99\% while maintaining or even improving transfer
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MPMAvatar是一个从多视角视频创建3D人体化身的框架，支持高真实感、鲁棒的动画和自由视角的照片级渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于物理模拟的方法在建模宽松服装的物理合理动态时存在精度有限或对新颖动画输入鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 使用基于物质点法的模拟器，结合各向异性本构模型和新型碰撞处理算法来建模复杂服装变形和身体接触；结合使用3D高斯溅射与准阴影渲染的规范化身。

Result: 在动态建模精度、渲染精度、鲁棒性和效率方面显著优于现有最先进的基于物理的化身方法，并能以零样本方式泛化到未见过的交互。

Conclusion: MPMAvatar框架在创建具有物理真实动态的3D人体化身方面取得了显著进展，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation
from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with
loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works
address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from
limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we
present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view
videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as
photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics
modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which
we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact
with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and
a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme
with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with
quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic
animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)
dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and
efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar
generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not
achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation
generalizability. Our project page is at:

*Hu Guo,Lily Patel,Rohan Gupt*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本研究探索将光学透视增强现实(OST-AR)与腕部振动触觉反馈相结合的多模态反馈系统，用于改善深度感知和空间精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OST-AR仅依赖视觉叠加可能导致注意力过载，且在遮挡或光照不佳时深度线索有限，需要多模态反馈来弥补这些局限性。

Method: 设计定制腕带配备六个振动电机，提供方向和状态提示，将其与手持工具和OST-AR集成，通过形成性研究和两个实验评估其对提示识别和深度引导的影响。

Result: 参与者在认知负荷下能准确识别触觉模式，多模态反馈相比仅视觉或仅触觉条件，显著提高了空间精度和可用性。

Conclusion: 结合OST-AR与腕部振动触觉的多模态反馈系统能有效改善深度感知和空间精度，为增强现实应用提供了更优的交互方案。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) overlays digital targets and
annotations on the physical world, offering promising guidance for hands-on
tasks such as medical needle insertion or assembly. Recent work on OST-AR depth
perception shows that target opacity and tool visualization significantly
affect accuracy and usability; opaque targets and rendering the real instrument
reduce depth errors, whereas transparent targets and absent tools impair
performance. However, reliance on visual overlays may overload attention and
leaves little room for depth cues when occlusion or lighting hampers
perception. To address these limitations, we explore multimodal feedback that
combines OST-AR with wrist-based vibrotactile haptics. The past two years have
seen rapid advances in haptic technology. Researchers have investigated
skin-stretch and vibrotactile cues for conveying spatial information to blind
users, wearable ring actuators that support precise pinching in AR, cross-modal
audio-haptic cursors that enable eyes-free object selection, and wrist-worn
feedback for teleoperated surgery that improves force awareness at the cost of
longer task times. Studies comparing pull versus push vibrotactile metaphors
found that pull cues yield faster gesture completion and lower cognitive load.
These findings motivate revisiting OST-AR guidance with a fresh perspective on
wrist-based haptics. We design a custom wristband with six vibromotors
delivering directional and state cues, integrate it with a handheld tool and
OST-AR, and assess its impact on cue recognition and depth guidance. Through a
formative study and two experiments (N=21 and N=27), we show that participants
accurately identify haptic patterns under cognitive load and that multimodal
feedback improves spatial precision and usability compared with visual-only or
haptic-only conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI检查的密闭空间和噪音会引起患者焦虑和幽闭恐惧症，导致运动伪影、扫描不完整和依赖药物镇静的问题。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an indispensable diagnostic tool, yet the
confined bore and acoustic noise can evoke considerable anxiety and
claustrophobic reactions. High anxiety leads to motion artifacts, incomplete
scans and reliance on pharmacological sedation. MIRAGE (Mixed Reality Anxiety
Guidance Environment) harnesses the latest mixed reality (MR) hardware to
prepare patients for MRI through immersive virtual reality (VR) and markerless
augmented reality (AR) registration. In this paper, we extend our previous work
by providing a comprehensive review of related research, detailing the system
architecture, and exploring metrics for patient and clinician experience. We
also present considerations for clinical deployment of MR systems within
hospital workflows. Our results indicate that depth-based registration achieves
sub-centimeter accuracy with minimal setup, while the immersive coaching
environment reduces patient anxiety and yields favourable usability scores.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ROI-GS是一个对象感知的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过对象引导的相机选择、针对性对象训练和高保真对象重建的无缝集成，在感兴趣区域实现更高细节，同时减少模型大小并保持实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在场景中均匀分配资源，限制了感兴趣区域的精细细节，导致模型尺寸膨胀。需要一种能优先处理选定对象高分辨率细节的方法。

Method: 提出ROI-GS框架，包含对象引导相机选择、针对性对象训练，以及高保真对象重建与全局场景的无缝集成。

Result: 实验显示ROI-GS显著提升局部质量（PSNR提升达2.96 dB），模型大小减少约17%，对单对象场景训练更快，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ROI-GS通过对象感知方法有效解决了3D场景重建中细节与效率的平衡问题，在保持实时性能的同时提升了感兴趣区域的细节质量。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high
detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods
allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions
Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an
object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera
selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity
object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method
prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining
real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves
local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by
$\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a
single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种可重光照框架，将微表面BRDF与高光-光泽度参数化集成到2D高斯泼溅中，通过延迟着色实现更物理一致的材料分解和高质量重光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法通常依赖简化的BRDF模型或耦合漫反射和镜面反射分量的参数化，限制了材料恢复的准确性和重光照保真度。

Method: 将微表面BRDF与高光-光泽度参数化集成到2D高斯泼溅中，使用延迟着色；利用表面法线和漫反射颜色的扩散先验指导早期优化；采用环境贴图的粗到精优化策略。

Result: 在复杂光泽场景上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了高质量的几何和材料重建，相比现有高斯泼溅方法，在新光照下提供了更真实和一致的重光照效果。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过物理一致的BRDF建模和优化策略，显著提升了光泽物体的重建和重光照质量。

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a
longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination
are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches
often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse
and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits
relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a
microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian
Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically
consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface
normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate
ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates
convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive
experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially
more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to
existing Gaussian splatting methods.
