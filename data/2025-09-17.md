*Mustafa Khanbhai,Giulia Di Nardo,Jun Ma,Vivienne Freitas,Caterina Masino,Ali Dolatabadi,Zhaoxun "Lorenz" Liu,Wey Leong,Wagner H. Souza,Amin Madani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人机协同机器学习方法，用于改进3D解剖结构分割算法的泛化能力，在乳腺癌MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并展示了在临床规划和患者教育中的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型在多样化数据集上泛化能力不足，需要开发能够跨数据集泛化的准确算法来支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 处理120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，采用三阶段流程：匿名化和手动分割、配准和分割（全乳、纤维腺体组织和肿瘤）、ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化。使用人机协同方法通过U-Mamba架构精化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba模型表现出色：T1加权图像上全器官DSC为0.97±0.013，纤维腺体组织为0.96±0.024，肿瘤为0.82±0.12。成功生成准确的3D重建，能够可视化复杂解剖特征。

Conclusion: 这种人机协同机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的3D重建和解剖分割算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并通过3D可视化提升了患者教育和沟通效果。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络自动分割辐照后TRISO燃料颗粒的微观图像层结构，替代传统人工分析方法，提高效率和客观性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辐照过程中TRISO燃料颗粒会出现内核膨胀和缓冲层致密化等现象，传统人工显微镜分析数千个颗粒既繁琐又主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 构建包含2000多张辐照TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用RU-Net（本研究开发）、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN架构进行自动图像分割

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在IoU（交并比）指标上表现最佳，能够显著加速TRISO颗粒截面分析并提高分割结果的客观性

Conclusion: 卷积神经网络可有效自动化TRISO燃料颗粒的微观结构分析，减少人工劳动并提高分析结果的客观性和效率

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种分层管道，使用自动编码器进行异常检测和多种方法进行状态估计，实现了高效的作物营养管理，在低能耗下实现早期异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前营养管理方法需要冗长分析，无法实时优化；成像技术虽然快速但计算密集，难以在资源受限环境下部署。需要开发高效准确的作物监测方案。

Method: 采用多光谱成像技术，构建分层管道：使用自动编码器进行早期异常检测，比较植被指数+随机森林和原始图像+视觉变换器两种状态估计方法。

Result: 高效异常检测（移植后9天检测73%的T3样本），能耗低于浪费氮肥的隐含能量。ViT在磷和钙估计上优于RF（R2 0.61 vs 0.58, 0.48 vs 0.35），但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会，展示了效率-准确性权衡下的优化方案。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个标注多格漫画的基准数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型在理解多模态幽默和识别叙事序列方面的能力。实验显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型(LMMs)仍是一个重大挑战。需要开发能够评估模型多模态上下文和叙事推理能力的严谨框架。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个标注的多格漫画，通过实验评估多个最先进的LMMs在面板排序和幽默理解任务上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示当前顶级模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%的准确率，远低于人类表现水平，表明现有模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态上下文和叙事推理提供了一个严谨框架，旨在推动开发能够更好参与自然、社会感知交互的LMMs，当前模型在多模态幽默理解方面仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线人-物交互（HOI）生成与感知新任务，基于Mamba框架开发了OnlineHOI网络架构，在流式数据处理中通过记忆机制整合历史信息，在多个在线任务上取得了最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI方法采用离线设置，可以从整个交互序列获取信息，但现实场景中每个时间步只能获取当前和历史信息（在线设置）。研究发现离线方法在线场景表现不佳，因此需要专门针对在线设置的新方法

Method: 提出OnlineHOI框架，基于Mamba框架构建网络架构，采用记忆机制。利用Mamba对流式数据的强大建模能力和记忆机制对历史信息的高效整合

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及在线HOI4D感知任务上取得了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 在线HOI处理需要专门的框架设计，基于Mamba和记忆机制的OnlineHOI框架能够有效处理流式交互数据，在多个在线任务上表现出色

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了深度学习在深度伪造技术中的应用及其对社会产生的负面影响，包括隐私侵犯、名人声誉损害和国家安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习技术特别是深度伪造技术的双刃剑效应，揭示其在社会应用中产生的各种负面影响和潜在风险。

Method: 通过分析深度伪造技术的技术原理和应用场景，评估其对个人隐私、政治稳定和国家安全的影响。

Result: 深度伪造技术能够产生难以辨别的伪造图像和视频，严重影响面部识别系统的功能，对个人和社会构成重大威胁。

Conclusion: 需要加强对深度伪造技术的监管和防范措施，以减轻其对社会的负面影响，保护个人隐私和国家安全。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置（SB）与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了频率感知的SB测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置对泛化能力很重要，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，缺乏对大模型SB的测量方法及其在真实图像分类任务中影响的理解。

Method: 1）理论分析现有复杂度测量方法的局限性；2）提出频率感知的SB测量方法；3）在CLIP模型上验证新方法；4）分析SB与各种图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新提出的频率感知SB测量方法比现有方法更有效和一致；SB强度与性能相关：更强的SB在分布外泛化上表现更好，但在对抗鲁棒性上表现较差。

Conclusion: 模型归纳偏置与目标任务特性的对齐很重要，SB强度应根据具体任务需求进行调整。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

*Mehdi Yousefzadeh,Parsa Esfahanian,Sara Rashidifar,Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan,Negar Sadat Rafiee Tabatabaee,Saeid Gorgin,Dara Rahmati,Maryam Daneshpazhooh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于群体图神经网络的皮肤镜图像分类框架，首次在ISIC规模上融合图像、毫米级尺度校准和患者元数据，显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤镜AI主要依赖图像而忽略了患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，限制了几何分析和分类性能。

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含图像特征、元数据和几何相似性的图结构，采用谱GNN进行半监督节点分类。

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分别达到0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏版本（使用25%边）保持AUC 0.9788，显著优于图像基线（0.9440）。

Conclusion: 融合校准尺度、病变几何和元数据的群体图方法在ISIC-2019上取得显著提升，稀疏图保持近最优精度，为皮肤镜决策支持提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

### [9] [PATIMT-Bench: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Position-Aware Text Image Machine Translation in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12278)
*Wanru Zhuang,Wenbo Li,Zhibin Lan,Xu Han,Peng Li,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文将传统文本图像机器翻译扩展为位置感知的文本图像机器翻译(PATIMT)，支持细粒度和保持布局的翻译，并构建了包含10个真实场景的基准测试集PATIMTBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TIMT研究主要关注为图像中所有文本提供翻译，但忽略了提供边界框和覆盖有限场景的问题，位置感知的细粒度翻译具有重要实用价值但尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出自适应图像OCR精炼管道，根据场景自适应选择OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像的结果；构建包含1200个高质量实例的人工标注测试集；对紧凑型大型视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 经过数据微调后，紧凑型LVLMs在两个子任务上都达到了最先进的性能，实验结果证明了训练数据的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务具有重要实用价值，提出的方法和基准测试集为位置感知的文本图像翻译提供了有效解决方案，展示了在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SimMemDA框架解决SAR与光学图像间的跨模态域适应问题，通过相似性引导和记忆引导机制提升无监督域自适应船舶尾迹检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像具有全天候观测能力但特征抽象噪声大，光学图像视觉线索清晰但存在域偏移问题，需要解决跨模态域适应挑战

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成SAR风格伪图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制，引入特征置信度记忆库和K近邻置信度加权融合策略，结合区域混合训练

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能提高跨模态船舶尾迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了光学到SAR图像的域适应问题，验证了所提方法的有效性和可行性

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Amplifier Air-Transformer的数据驱动、物理引导的深度学习方法，用于生成美国本土2公里分辨率、每小时更新的气温数据，填补了气象站和卫星数据之间的时空空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然气象站提供连续监测，卫星提供广泛空间覆盖，但没有单一数据源能够提供无缝的时空气温数据。需要一种方法结合两者的优势，实现高时空分辨率的气温监测。

Method: 采用两阶段神经网络方法：首先通过编码年温度周期的神经网络重建被云遮挡的GOES-16地表温度数据，然后通过另一个神经网络将重建的地表温度转换为气温，利用深度学习集成学习进行预测不确定性估计。

Result: 基于77.7亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站气温记录（2018-2024年）构建和测试，在站点验证中实现了1.93°C的每小时气温映射精度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了地表温度重建和气温预测流程，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的气温无缝监测，生成的数据已公开提供。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，在动物重识别任务中，后处理度量学习的效果高度依赖于骨干网络嵌入的初始质量和领域特异性。领域专用模型比通用模型更容易通过度量学习进行优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在动物重识别任务中，通用模型和领域专用模型作为骨干网络时，后处理度量学习方法的有效性差异，以及理解通用特征在细粒度任务中的局限性。

Method: 使用通用模型DINOv2和领域专用模型MegaDescriptor作为骨干网络，结合K近邻分类器和鲁棒阈值处理进行个体识别，并采用三元组学习投影头进行后处理优化。

Result: 领域专用模型MegaDescriptor通过三元组学习性能提升0.13分，而通用模型DINOv2仅提升0.03分（基于平均BAKS和BAUS指标）。验证损失停滞和可视化分析表明通用流形更难针对细粒度任务进行重塑。

Conclusion: 通用特征在专业化、小数据量的重识别任务中存在关键局限性，领域特异性预训练对于此类任务至关重要，后处理度量学习对领域专用模型更有效。

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在边缘设备上部署面临计算资源限制的问题，需要探索模型压缩和适配策略以支持高效推理

Method: 基于GhostNetV3架构开发GhostNetV3-Small变体，并比较传统知识蒸馏、教师助理和教师集成等多种蒸馏技术

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版GhostNetV3，但所有蒸馏策略都导致准确率下降

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构适配比蒸馏技术更具影响力，需要进一步研究有效的模型设计和先进的蒸馏技术

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench数据集和DYNAMO模型，用于从CAD点云预测齿轮组件的耦合运动轨迹，解决了机械装配体中基于几何耦合的运动推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对日常铰接物体的运动分析通常假设简化的运动学结构或依赖关节标注，但机械装配体（如齿轮）的运动来自几何耦合（啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何形状推理关系运动。

Method: 引入MechBench数据集（693个合成齿轮装配体）和DYNAMO模型（依赖感知神经网络），直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个部件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: DYNAMO在实验中优于强基线方法，在不同齿轮配置下实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了一个新颖的系统框架，用于数据驱动的CAD装配体中耦合机械运动学习。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

Motivation: 棉花是全球最重要的天然纤维作物，但收获仍受限于劳动密集型人工采摘、效率低下以及错过最佳收获窗口导致的产量损失。准确识别棉铃及其成熟度对于自动化、产量估算和育种研究至关重要

Method: 基于YOLOv11n构建，通过改进卷积设计增强空间表示和鲁棒性，引入NeLU增强的全局注意力机制来捕捉弱特征和低对比度特征，以及扩张感受野SPPF模块以低成本扩展感受野进行多尺度上下文建模

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet为田间部署提供了准确高效的解决方案，为自动化棉花采摘和高通量表型分析提供了可靠基础

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Motivation: 当前图像生成模型在预构建的潜在空间中捕获图像分布，但重建分布与生成分布存在显著差异。现有分词器只关注重建任务，未考虑生成过程中的误差。

Method: 提出主训练阶段使用潜在扰动策略模拟生成噪声，增强分词器鲁棒性；后训练阶段针对训练好的生成模型优化分词器解码器，减小分布差异。

Result: 使用约4亿参数的生成器，经过主训练的分词器达到1.60 gFID，后训练后进一步提升至1.36 gFID。实验验证了该方法对离散和连续分词器以及自回归和扩散生成器的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的分词器训练方案有效解决了重建与生成分布差异问题，显著提升了生成质量，并提出了新的评估指标pFID成功关联分词器性能与生成质量。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然成本低、耐用且对遮挡和环境条件鲁棒，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化的基础模型和大数据集，通常需要从小数据集从头训练任务特定模型

Method: 收集了100万样本（29小时）的大规模原始雷达数据集，训练了GRT基础模型，使用原始雷达数据而非有损表示，并进行了广泛的设计消融实验

Result: GRT能够泛化到不同场景，可针对不同任务进行微调，每10倍数据量性能提升20%，使用原始数据相当于10倍训练数据的性能提升，估计需要约1亿样本（3000小时）才能充分发挥GRT潜力

Conclusion: 大规模数据集和基础模型方法能够显著提升毫米波雷达感知性能，原始数据的使用优于传统有损表示，为毫米波雷达的标准化发展提供了重要基础

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估框架，系统测试了视觉语言模型在不同噪声条件下的鲁棒性，包括光照变化、运动模糊和压缩伪影，发现模型性能受标注质量、模型大小和噪声类型影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，需要建立一个标准化的评估基准。

Method: 使用受控扰动（光照变化、运动模糊、压缩伪影）来测试多个最先进的VLM模型，采用词汇指标（BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE、CIDEr）和基于神经网络的句子嵌入相似度来衡量语义对齐。

Result: 实验发现：(1) 标注描述性显著影响模型性能；(2) 大模型如LLaVA在语义理解方面表现优异但并非总是优于小模型；(3) JPEG压缩和运动模糊等噪声类型会显著降低所有模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型大小、数据集特征和噪声鲁棒性之间的微妙权衡，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，为缺乏像素级标注的场景提供了实用解决方案，具有出色的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop
breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical
stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key
structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive,
error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present
a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from
RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation,
3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and
agronomic research.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出MGNM多模态图网络模型，利用GNN显式建模人-物交互关系，在HOI检测任务上实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer方法在HOI检测中占主导地位，但无法显式建模关系结构，而GNN天生更适合处理人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间的信息传播

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中达到state-of-the-art性能，与更先进的目标检测器结合时性能显著提升，并在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的MGNM模型通过显式建模关系结构，有效提升了HOI检测性能，证明了图神经网络在该任务中的优势

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Motivation: 现有光照估计方法在恢复光照图细节纹理方面存在困难，或在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战，需要新的解决方案

Method: 使用VQVAE提取光照图的离散特征避免后验坍塌，通过ViT捕获输入图像的全局上下文和依赖关系，将光照估计构建为多分类任务

Conclusion: 定性和定量实验表明该方法相比现有最先进方法实现了更优越的结果，成功解决了光照估计中的纹理细节和速度保真度平衡问题

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种适用于各种一致性蒸馏框架的自适应采样调度器，通过动态目标时间步选择、优化交替采样以及稳定生成技术，显著提高了扩散模型的采样效率和生成质量。


<details>

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强大的适应性，显著提高了扩散模型的生成性能，扩展了一致性蒸馏模型在复杂生成场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

TL;DR: 提出了针对LiDAR定位的对抗攻击框架DisorientLiDAR，通过逆向工程识别关键点并移除，成功在虚拟和物理世界中破坏了LiDAR定位系统的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易受到视觉不可察觉的对抗攻击，但针对自动驾驶汽车LiDAR定位系统的攻击研究较少，大多数对抗攻击集中在3D感知领域。

Method: 通过逆向工程定位模型（如特征提取网络），识别关键关键点并策略性地移除它们，从而破坏基于LiDAR的定位。使用近红外吸收材料在物理世界中隐藏关键区域。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上对三种最先进的点云配准模型（HRegNet、D3Feat和GeoTransformer）进行评估，移除包含Top-K关键点的区域显著降低了配准精度。在Autoware自动驾驶平台上，隐藏少数关键区域即可引起明显的定位漂移。物理世界实验成功复现了攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了针对LiDAR定位系统的对抗攻击的可行性和有效性，为自动驾驶系统的安全性提供了重要警示，并展示了从虚拟到物理世界的攻击迁移能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Conclusion: 通过光谱学习视角和光谱码本方法，能够有效区分和去除图像中的反射，在反射去除任务上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有对抗鲁棒性蒸馏方法虽然能提升学生模型的鲁棒性，但会导致清洁样本性能下降。主要原因是双教师框架中优化目标冲突和迭代生成的对抗样本导致教师模型性能退化

Method: 提出循环迭代ARD方法(CIARD)，包含：1)多教师框架配合对比推挽损失对齐来解决双教师优化目标冲突；2)连续对抗重训练来维持教师模型对变化对抗样本的动态鲁棒性

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet上，CIARD平均提升3.53%的对抗防御率和5.87%的清洁样本准确率，在平衡模型鲁棒性和泛化性方面建立新基准

Conclusion: CIARD方法有效解决了对抗鲁棒性蒸馏中的性能退化问题，通过创新的多教师框架和连续训练机制，实现了鲁棒性和泛化性的更好平衡

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个语义对齐的多模态操纵检测数据集SAMM和检索增强的检测框架RamDG，解决了现有基准中跨模态不对齐的问题，在检测准确率上比现有方法提升2.06%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态操纵检测基准存在跨模态不对齐的伪影，无法反映真实世界的操纵模式。真实攻击通常保持跨模态语义一致性，而现有数据集人为破坏这种对齐关系，产生易于检测的异常

Method: 1) 构建SAMM数据集：采用两阶段流程，先应用先进图像操纵技术，再生成上下文合理的文本叙述来强化视觉欺骗；2) 提出RamDG框架：利用外部知识库检索上下文证据，通过图像伪造定位和深度操纵检测模块追踪所有操纵

Conclusion: 该研究填补了语义协调操纵检测的空白，提出的SAMM数据集和RamDG框架为多模态媒体取证提供了更真实有效的解决方案

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角地理定位任务面临显著的外观变化和特征提取困难，现有方法忽视空间和语义信息，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: 采用MFAF方法，包含多频率分支块(MFB)捕获多尺度低频结构和高频边缘特征，以及频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块自适应关注关键区域。

Result: 在University-1652、SUES-200和Dense-UAV等基准测试中表现出色，在无人机定位和导航任务中取得竞争优势。

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过多尺度频率特征提取和注意力机制，显著提升了跨视角地理定位的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文对YOLOv8-s、YOLOv9-s、YOLOv10-s和YOLOv11-s在水下图像检测任务上的性能进行了首次系统比较，发现YOLOv9之后准确率趋于饱和，而YOLOv10在嵌入式AUV部署中提供了最佳的速度-准确率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主航行器(AUVs)依赖计算机视觉系统进行任务，但水下图像存在光线衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡等问题，且AUV计算资源有限。需要评估YOLO系列检测器在水下环境的表现。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集（珊瑚疾病数据集和鱼类物种数据集），创建四种训练规模（25%、50%、75%、100%图像），在相同超参数下训练四个YOLO变体，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间等指标，并进行Grad-CAM可视化分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9之后准确率饱和，主要改进在于效率而非准确率。推理速度显著提升，YOLOv10在速度和准确率之间提供了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个近期YOLO变体在水下图像上的对比结果，表明轻量级YOLOv10最适合嵌入式AUV部署，并提供了可复现的基准和代码库以加速未来海洋视觉研究。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic
stereo dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios. Built on
the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集为推进真实世界火灾场景中稳健实用的图像去烟技术提供了宝贵基础，该数据集已公开发布。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the

Conclusion: 通过统一融合和RIS任务的联合优化，有效解决了文本驱动图像融合中的语义对齐问题，提出的框架和数据集为多模态参考图像分割任务提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

TL;DR: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，通过解构-重构框架和去偏策略解决组合零样本学习中的特征纠缠和长尾分布问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习中，属性和对象的纠缠特性以及现实数据中的长尾分布使得学习泛化性组合表示具有挑战性。受神经科学发现（想象与感知共享相似神经过程）启发

Method: DeFA方法整合了解构-重构框架进行特征增强和去偏策略，通过合成高保真组合特征来显式利用已见属性和对象的先验知识

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行大量实验，证明DeFA在封闭世界和开放世界设置下都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA方法有效解决了组合零样本学习中的特征纠缠和长尾分布问题，通过特征增强和去偏策略实现了优异的组合泛化能力

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，专门针对视觉-语言模型中的模态不对称问题设计，通过三种专家组实现更好的跨模态交互，在减少参数的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言模态时面临不对称挑战，视觉信息具有空间完整性而语言需要保持序列上下文，导致深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础并过度依赖参数知识。

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三个专门化专家组：模态内专家处理特定模态特征，双曲跨模态专家处理层次化跨模态交互，证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏见并保持上下文基础。

Result: 实验表明AsyMoE相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别获得26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，同时比密集模型减少25.45%的激活参数。

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言处理的不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法的局限性，在保持参数效率的同时显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个动态空间推理基准测试，用于评估模型在局部可观测、动态变化环境中的空间理解和自适应规划能力，揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观测环境，无法捕捉在部分可观测和动态变化条件下长时程推理和记忆利用的挑战。

Method: 引入了两个动态空间基准：局部可观测迷宫导航和match-2消除任务，每个动作都会触发环境结构变化；提出了基于主观经验的记忆机制用于跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明，这些基准测试揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来方法学进展提供了一个全面的评估平台，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen提出了一种基于球面投影的单视图3D生成方法，通过将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为多层2D表示，解决了现有方法的多视角不一致性问题，同时能够表示复杂内部结构和拓扑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视图3D生成模型通常采用多视角扩散先验来重建物体表面，但容易产生视角间不一致，且无法忠实表示复杂内部结构或非平凡拓扑。

Method: 将几何信息投影到边界球面上，展开为紧凑的结构化多层2D球面投影(SP)表示，在图像域操作，直接继承强大的2D扩散先验。

Result: SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SPGen方法通过球面投影表示，同时实现了视角一致性、结构灵活性和计算效率，为单视图3D生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型越狱攻击的有效性和效率仍有提升空间，研究发现将弱防御融入攻击流程可以显著提升越狱效果

Method: 包含三个核心组件：视觉优化器嵌入具有肯定语义的通用对抗扰动；文本优化器使用防御风格提示词优化输入；红队后缀生成器通过强化微调增强越狱效果

Result: 在4个VLM和4个安全基准测试中，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法

Conclusion: 这项工作为越狱视觉语言模型提供了新的视角，展示了利用防御模式指导攻击设计的有效性

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Motivation: 解决在动态多样的室内环境中收集高质量RF数据的挑战，RF传感作为视觉方法的隐私保护替代方案需要可靠的数据生成方法。

Conclusion: WaveVerse提供了一个可扩展的框架，能够生成真实的RF信号数据，为RF感知任务提供了有效的数据生成解决方案，特别是在隐私保护要求高的应用场景中。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法采用无差别的属性分配策略，导致双监督下的梯度冲突问题，且表示效率有待提升

Method: 引入动态激活SH或法向量的致密化策略，基于梯度幅度自适应调整SH阶次，执行任务解耦剪枝去除冗余高斯

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面均优于现有最优方法，参数量显著减少的同时获得更优性能

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，可无缝集成到其他框架中，在提升性能的同时减小模型规模

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了深度可分离网络中学习到的8个主关键滤波器，发现它们可以通过高斯核的空间平滑操作和差分算子来建模，且理想化模型具有良好的预测性能，可以替代学习到的滤波器。

Motivation: 研究深度可分离深度网络中学习到的感受野滤波器的特性，探索是否可以用离散尺度空间滤波器来近似这些学习到的滤波器，以简化网络结构并提高可解释性。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器绝对值的加权均值和加权方差作为空间扩散度量，然后使用高斯核的离散模拟进行空间平滑操作，并应用差分算子来建模主关键滤波器。采用两种建模方式：不同坐标方向的尺度参数和相同尺度参数，并通过空间方差相等或最小化l1/l2范数进行模型拟合。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习到的滤波器可以通过离散尺度空间滤波器很好地近似，这为网络简化和可解释性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态LLMs与人类在图像质量评估上的差异，发现LLMs在理解图像美学、解剖准确性等属性方面与人类存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估文本到图像生成模型是一个挑战，现有工作使用多模态LLMs评估图像质量，但缺乏对LLMs如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图等）进行判断的深入理解

Method: 首先通过合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，分析图像质量属性间的相关性；然后对LLMs进行相同分析；最后针对每个图像质量属性生成高控制度的合成数据集进行研究

Result: 人类能够轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但多模态LLMs在某些属性（如解剖准确性）上学习判断更加困难；图像质量属性间的关系在LLMs中比在人类中弱得多

Conclusion: 研究发现揭示了人类和多模态LLMs在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，为改进自动化图像质量评估提供了重要见解

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角目标地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归目标位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误校正机制。

Method: 提出循环跨视角目标地理定位Transformer(ReCOT)，使用可学习token编码查询图像和提示嵌入的任务特定意图，通过迭代注意力机制逐步细化位置预测。包含SAM知识蒸馏策略和参考特征增强模块(RFEM)。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时相比之前SOTA方法减少60%参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架和知识蒸馏策略，有效解决了跨视角目标地理定位中的噪声敏感和错误校正问题，实现了更高效准确的定位性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟问题且质量可能因相机姿态不准确、DSM误差和场景遮挡而下降，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 基于在线3DGS优化，每获取一张图像就通过在线SfM计算姿态和稀疏点云，将新高斯集成并优化到未重建区域，结合正交splatting技术实现实时渲染。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每张新图像的3DGS优化仅需数秒，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和几何精度。

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成的延迟问题，实现了近实时的数字正射影像图生成，为城市管理、规划等领域的实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在少样本学习中面临令牌级交互精炼困难、训练数据有限和归纳偏置不足的挑战，现有方法依赖不灵活的令牌匹配或基础相似性度量，限制了全局上下文和局部特征精炼的有效整合。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：预训练阶段使用掩码图像建模提供可迁移的补丁级表示；元微调阶段引入双层次自适应令牌精炼模块，包括令牌聚类、不确定性感知令牌加权、双层次注意力机制、图令牌传播和类分离惩罚。

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上的广泛实验表明，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景中都取得了优异的结果，显著提升了基于transformer的少样本分类性能。

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式改进令牌表示和保持强大的归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的关键挑战，为少样本分类提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba架构的自动多期相CECT胰腺肿瘤亚型分类方法，通过双层次对比增强感知模块和时空建模，在270例临床数据上达到97.4%准确率和98.6% AUC


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤具有高度异质性和变异性，传统方法无法有效利用放射科医生诊断流程中常用的多期相CECT数据的上下文信息，限制了亚型诊断的准确性

Method: 使用Mamba架构进行时空建模；提出双层次对比增强感知模块，包含新颖的空间和时间采样序列来探索病灶的期相内和期相间对比变化；加入相似性引导的精炼模块强调局部肿瘤区域的时序变化学习；设计空间互补整合器和多粒度融合模块进行跨尺度语义编码和聚合

Result: 在270例临床病例的内部数据集上，区分胰腺导管腺癌(PDAC)和胰腺神经内分泌肿瘤(PNETs)的准确率达到97.4%，AUC达到98.6%

Conclusion: 该方法为胰腺肿瘤亚型分类提供了更准确高效的自动化工具，展现了在多期相CECT数据分析中的潜力

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文表示学习网络，通过整合功能推理和上下文提示来改进人-物交互检测，在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两阶段方法在上下文建模方面存在不足，无法充分捕捉复杂的交互关系，特别是涉及辅助实体（如工具）的多变量关系

Method: 扩展传统HOI检测框架，通过三元组结构<人、工具、物体>显式建模辅助对象的功能角色，使用可学习提示与上下文视觉特征通过注意力机制整合

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集的大多数场景中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 通过上下文化表示学习和功能推理，能够更好地处理复杂、依赖上下文的交互关系，提升了HOI检测的可靠性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 制造业视觉异常检测面临真实异常样本稀缺的问题，现有合成方法存在结构不一致和特征纠缠两大限制，需要新的生成框架来解决这些挑战

Method: 采用双螺旋架构，包含特征分离、连接和融合模块，使用域解耦注意力机制独立增强图像和标注特征，语义分数图对齐模块确保结构真实性，支持文本提示和图形引导

Result: 在多样性和真实性方面显著优于现有最先进方法，在下游异常检测任务中带来显著性能提升

Conclusion: DH-Diff通过创新的跨域生成框架成功解决了合成异常数据的关键问题，为制造业视觉异常检测提供了高质量的数据增强解决方案

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低层特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高层特征但往往牺牲超像素的规则性来捕获复杂物体，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差。

Method: 训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与物体掩码对齐，并能处理任何先验高层分割和不确定区域。

Result: 综合实验表明，SPAM在分割任务上定性和定量均优于最先进方法，成为各种应用的宝贵且鲁棒的工具。

Conclusion: SPAM框架成功解决了超像素分割中准确性与规则性之间的权衡问题，提供了一个多功能且交互性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性注意力通过均匀压缩历史KV信息来降低计算复杂度，但会导致特征冗余和方向对齐损失，造成性能差距。

Method: 引入输入自适应的可学习门控来选择性调制KV特征图的信息聚合，增强语义多样性并缓解低秩约束；提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法进行门控计算。

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下，相比PVT-T实现1.76倍吞吐量提升和2.69倍GPU峰值内存降低；在ImageNet上top-1准确率提升最高达4.4%。

Conclusion: SAGA在保持线性注意力计算效率优势的同时，显著提升了模型表达能力和性能，实现了效率与效果的良好平衡。

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像基础模型受限于较小数据集，需要系统研究数据规模和预训练范式如何影响医疗场景下的性能表现

Method: 使用单一机构的350万张胸部X光片，在保持计算资源和评估协议不变的情况下，对MI2（CLIP范式）和RAD-DINO（DINOv2范式）进行持续预训练，评估分类、分割和报告生成任务

Result: MI2在放射学发现相关任务上扩展性更好，RAD-DINO在管道相关任务上更强；使用UniCL结合报告和结构化标签持续预训练MI2能提升性能；某些任务仅需3万张域内样本即可超越开源基础模型

Conclusion: 机构特定的持续预训练具有重要价值，医疗机构可通过利用域内数据获得显著性能提升

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Conclusion: 基于不同感知方法的度量融合能够有效克服单一指标的局限性，为NeRF生成图像质量评估提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据具有巨大潜力，特别适用于罕见疾病中的数据稀缺问题，虽然方法针对医学领域定制，但相关技术和见解可适应其他领域

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Conclusion: CCS为物体检测器提供了DevOps风格的稳健监控基础，能够在无标注情况下有效评估模型性能

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Method: 提出基于Runge-Kutta微分方程求解器的高效高阶反演方法，以及解耦扩散变换器注意力机制(DDTA)，分离文本和图像注意力

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is
available at https://github.com/wmchen/RKSovler_DDTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO)框架，通过共享-特定解耦学习和协调梯度学习策略，解决手术三元组识别中的任务间和任务内优化冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术三元组识别面临长尾数据分布问题，现有方法存在任务间优化冲突（通用与特定表示纠缠）和任务内优化冲突（类别不平衡）两大挑战

Method: 1) S²D学习方案分解表示为共享和特定组件；2) 使用MLLM构建概率提示池动态增强视觉特征；3) 协调梯度学习策略重新平衡头尾类梯度

Result: 在CholecT45和CholecT50数据集上的广泛实验证明了该框架的优越性，有效处理了优化冲突问题

Conclusion: MEJO框架通过创新的表示解耦和梯度协调机制，显著提升了手术三元组识别的性能，为解决复杂手术场景理解中的优化冲突提供了有效方案

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航任务缺乏对协作对话的全面评估，需要让引导者推断导航者的位置，使通信对任务成功至关重要。

Method: 收集并发布RAIN数据集（人类对话配对导航轨迹），设计综合基准评估导航和对话，分析不同导航者和引导者模型的影响。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了具身对话研究的发展，通过公开数据集、代码和评估框架促进未来研究。

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a
navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn
dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic
evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making
communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and
release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog
paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

### [68] [Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897)
*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Chong Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS)方法，通过在LVLMs中引入视觉记忆机制，平滑关键对象的注意力分布，提高视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)虽然能准确定位图像中的关键对象，但对这些对象的注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键对象可以提升LVLMs的视觉能力。

Method: CLVS方法包含视觉记忆机制，在首层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化记忆，后续层中模型视觉注意力会综合考虑先前层的视觉记忆，同时迭代更新记忆以保持对关键对象的平滑注意力。使用不确定性作为视觉理解完成的指标来终止平滑过程。

Result: 在三个LVLMs的四个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和通用性。CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上达到了最先进的性能，特别是在关系和属性理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: CLVS通过跨层视觉平滑机制有效提升了LVLMs的视觉理解能力，特别是在需要持续关注关键对象的任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个基于多模态场景图指导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在保持细节和结构清晰度方面显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要依赖低层次视觉线索（如纹理和对比度），难以捕捉图像中的高层次语义信息，且现有文本引导方法缺乏结构化建模和空间定位能力

Method: 通过深度耦合来自文本和视觉的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，然后通过场景图表示、层次聚合和图驱动融合等模块同步优化高层次语义和低层次细节

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中显著优于最先进方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面，在下游任务（如低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中表现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图指导的多模态融合框架，有效解决了现有方法在高层次语义捕捉方面的局限性，为红外与可见光图像融合提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的生成式异常检测方法，通过图像到图像转换和片段相似性评分，在胸部CT和脑部MRI中实现了更准确的异常分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学领域的异常检测和无监督分割应用广泛，但现有生成式方法面临细粒度组织变异性的挑战，需要提出更有效的解决方案。

Method: 方法包含两个步骤：1）图像到图像转换进行无异常重建；2）通过片段相似性评分对比观察图像与生成图像，实现精确异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT扫描中检测感染性疾病痒叙和脑部MRI中缩行性脑梗塞痒叙分割任务上，新方法在DICE分数上相对现有最优方法分别提升了1.9%和4.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理正常细粒度组织变异性，在不同医学形态学数据中都显示出优秀的异常检测和分割性能，具有良好的普适性。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN是一个时间感知的Siamese跟踪框架，通过显式时间建模增强SiamTPN架构，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升空中目标跟踪性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器大多关注空间线索而忽视时间依赖，在长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性有限；基于相关的Siamese跟踪器受限于线性相关操作，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化

Method: 扩展SiamTPN架构，引入时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性并实现更丰富的特征表示

Result: 相比基线方法，T-SiamTPN成功率和精度分别提升13.7%和14.7%；在Jetson Nano上实时运行（7.1 FPS），计算效率高

Conclusion: 时间建模对Siamese跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大且高效的解决方案

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

*Melika Sabaghian,Mohammad Ali Keyvanrad,Seyyedeh Mahila Moghadami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对YOLOv8的三阶段压缩管道，结合稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道知识蒸馏，在VisDrone数据集上实现73.51%参数减少的同时仅损失2.7%精度，推理速度从26FPS提升至68FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上高效部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测，需要在保持性能的同时实现显著压缩。

Method: 三阶段压缩管道：1）稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2）利用批量归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3）采用通道知识蒸馏缓解精度损失，并使用可调节温度和损失加权方案。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减少到6.85M（减少73.51%），FLOPs从49.6G降到13.3G，MACs从101G降到34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%至47.9，推理速度从26FPS提升到45FPS。使用TensorRT后速度进一步提升至68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效的模型压缩，在保持检测精度的同时显著提升了推理速度，适用于资源受限的高吞吐量场景。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于回归的点云配准质量验证方法，取代传统的分类方法，能够更精细地量化配准质量，并通过多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的点云配准质量验证方法都采用分类方式，只能将配准质量划分为几个类别，无法提供精细的量化评估。本文旨在通过回归方法实现更细粒度的配准质量量化。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准质量验证，扩展了先前使用的错位相关特征，采用多尺度特征提取和基于注意力的聚合机制。

Result: 该方法在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在具有异质空间密度的点云上表现优异。在指导下游建图任务时，相比最先进的基于分类的方法，显著提高了给定重配准帧数下的建图质量。

Conclusion: 回归方法相比分类方法能够提供更精细的点云配准质量量化，多尺度特征提取和注意力聚合机制有效提升了验证精度，特别是在处理异质密度点云时表现突出。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

TL;DR: 4DRadar-GS是一个基于4D雷达增强的自监督3D重建框架，专门针对动态驾驶场景，通过雷达辅助的高斯初始化和速度引导的点跟踪模型，解决了现有方法在动态对象重建中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督3D重建方法在动态驾驶场景中面临运动估计不准确和时间一致性弱的问题，导致动态对象重建不完整或失真。需要一种能够准确重建动态场景元素的方法。

Method: 提出4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化方案，利用4D雷达的速度和空间信息分割动态对象并恢复单目深度尺度；开发速度引导的点跟踪模型(VGPT)，在场景流监督下联合训练，跟踪细粒度动态轨迹并构建时间一致的表示。

Result: 在OmniHD-Scenes数据集上评估，4DRadar-GS在动态驾驶场景3D重建方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态对象重建的挑战，为自动驾驶系统的验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的三维重建解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯分布的开放词汇对象提取新方法，通过对象级特征聚合绕过可微分渲染的限制，实现准确的3D场景理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯分布技术虽然实现了实时逼真渲染，但其固有的模糊性限制了在AR/VR和机器人等领域的3D场景理解应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但alpha混合会在对象间平均语义，无法实现真正的3D级理解

Method: 利用预分解的对象级高斯分布，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合为每个对象创建全面的"嵌入包"，完全绕过语义的可微分渲染过程

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇对象提取的挑战，同时在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法为3D高斯分布场景理解提供了范式转换的解决方案，通过对象级嵌入聚合实现了准确的开放词汇对象检索和无缝任务适应

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机与脉冲神经网络结合具有能效优势，但事件数据稀缺且DVS输出稀疏，现有方法忽略了RGB与DVS模态间的显著分布差异

Method: TMKT细粒度混合策略，利用SNN异步特性在不同时间步插值RGB和DVS输入；引入模态感知辅助学习目标支持跨模态标签混合

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨模态知识迁移中的分布差异问题，为事件相机与SNN的高效能视觉处理提供了新思路

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击的多模态多表面交互式分割方法，通过融合RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击来预测改进的分割掩码，显著减少了所需点击次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多表面同时存在于同一图像中的复杂分割问题，特别是当这些表面高度纠缠和相邻时的挑战，需要开发新的评估指标和方法来处理这种场景。

Method: 采用网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、多个非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，预测改进的分割掩码。设计满足两个条件：RGB主干网络作为黑盒使用，交互特定信息在图像特征提取和多模态融合后集成以减少响应时间。

Result: 多模态融合策略有效，在DeLiVER数据集上平均每表面减少1.28次点击（NoC@90），在MFNet上减少1.19次点击。RGB-only基线在经典单掩码交互分割场景中也表现出竞争力甚至更优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了多表面交互分割的挑战，多模态输入显著提升了分割效率，同时保持了在传统单掩码场景下的良好性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

*Yan Chen,Long Li,Teng Xi,Long Zeng,Jingdong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段强化学习框架PeBR-R1，专门针对视觉语言模型的感知和推理能力进行联合增强，解决了直接从LLMs移植RL方法到VLMs的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL方法直接从LLMs移植到VLMs效果不佳，因为VLMs需要先准确感知视觉输入才能进行有效推理，任务更加复杂。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升视觉感知能力；第二阶段专注于增强推理能力。使用数据集级采样来缓解RL训练中的优势消失问题。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上的实验表明，PeBR-R1在多种视觉推理任务中表现出优越性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功提升了VLMs的感知和推理能力，为视觉语言模型的强化学习训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档的文本行分割面临独特挑战：不规则笔迹、褪色墨水、复杂布局和重叠行。标注数据稀缺使全监督学习方法不实用，需要开发少样本学习方法。

Method: 举办FEST竞赛，使用U-DIADS-TL数据集，要求参与者仅用每份手稿的3张标注图像进行训练，开发能够处理多样化布局和退化程度的文本行分割系统。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多种古代手稿，具有广泛的布局、退化程度和非标准格式，真实反映实际条件。通过少样本学习促进稳健适应方法的发展。

Conclusion: FEST竞赛通过强调少样本学习，旨在开发只需最少人工标注的鲁棒方法，促进自动化文档分析工具在历史研究中的更广泛应用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

TL;DR: TFANet是一个三阶段图像-文本特征对齐网络，通过知识增强、融合和强化三个阶段系统性地解决多模态对齐问题，提升复杂场景下的指代图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的指代图像分割方法在多模态对齐和语言语义损失方面存在困难，特别是在包含多个视觉相似对象的复杂场景中，经常出现目标定位错误或不完整分割的问题。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：1) 知识增强阶段(KPS)使用多尺度线性交叉注意力模块实现双向语义交换；2) 知识融合阶段(KFS)通过跨模态特征扫描模块捕获长距离依赖；3) 知识强化阶段(KIS)使用词级语言特征引导的语义深化模块补偿语义退化。

Result: 该方法建立了图像区域与不同粒度语言描述之间的丰富高效对齐，构建了统一的跨模态表示，提升了复杂场景下的对齐精度。

Conclusion: TFANet通过系统性的三阶段特征对齐框架，有效解决了多模态错位和语言语义损失问题，显著改善了复杂场景下的指代图像分割性能。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

*Hemanth Chandravamsi,Dhanush V. Shenoy,Steven H. Frankel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种针对SIREN网络的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动来解决SIREN在拟合频谱不匹配信号时的'频谱瓶颈'问题，在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN网络在初始化不当时，对于频谱与其频率支持不匹配的信号拟合能力有限，会出现'频谱瓶颈'现象，导致模型输出接近零且无法恢复其表示能力范围内的频率分量。

Method: WINNER方法对基础SIREN的均匀初始化权重进行高斯噪声扰动，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需引入额外可训练参数。

Result: 该方法在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升。

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱瓶颈问题，还为深度神经网络训练提供了新的自适应、目标感知初始化策略方向。

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose

especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust
and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion
Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for

diverse pre-trained sub-models, Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT,
which are meticulously fine-tuned through a multi-stage process on the
MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these
specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively
leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of
0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position
out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的课程多任务自监督学习框架(CMTSSL)，用于高光谱图像的轻量级模型训练，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低模型复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像数据维度高且卫星数据传输速率慢，需要轻量级模型支持星上处理并减少冗余数据传输

Method: 整合掩码图像建模与解耦的空间和光谱拼图求解，采用课程学习策略逐步增加数据复杂度，联合捕获光谱连续性、空间结构和全局语义特征

Conclusion: CMTSSL在轻量级架构的通用表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，特别适合星上卫星部署的实际高光谱应用

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务中显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%。研究发现VFM通过文本-图像对齐学习到了伪造相关概念，但这种能力依赖于预训练数据的时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像专用检测器在精心设计的基准测试上表现良好，但在真实世界场景中失败率极高，假阴性率严重。研究者希望找到更有效的解决方案来应对真实世界的检测挑战。

Method: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)作为特征提取器，在其上训练简单的线性分类器。通过文本-图像相似性探针分析VFM学习到的表示，并创建了一个在VFM预训练截止日期后收集的新数据集来验证数据暴露的影响。

Result: 基于VFM的基线方法在相同训练数据下显著优于专用检测器，在真实世界基准测试中准确率提升超过20%。研究发现近期VLM学会了将合成图像与伪造相关概念对齐，但这种能力在预训练截止日期后的新数据上急剧下降。

Conclusion: 1) 对于真实世界的AI生成图像检测，更新的VFM原始能力比静态检测器的精心设计更有效；2) 真正的泛化评估需要测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史，包括预训练阶段。

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率下的时序密集推理，但计算帧级特征的计算成本很高。视频中存在大量时间冗余，可以利用这种冗余来降低计算成本。

Method: 1. 提出ResidualViT架构，包含可学习的残差连接确保时序一致性，以及token缩减模块选择性丢弃冗余信息；2. 轻量级蒸馏策略近似原始基础模型的帧级特征；3. 在4个任务5个数据集上评估零样本和全监督设置。

Conclusion: ResidualViT通过利用视频时间冗余，有效降低了时序密集视频任务的计算成本，在多个任务和数据集上都取得了显著的效果提升。

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医学AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,

Result: 实验表明该方法能够生成逼真、无需后处理的动画就绪3D头像，在多个评估指标上持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的两阶段设计和适配器机制，有效解决了单图像3D头像重建中的遮挡区域控制问题，实现了高质量的文本可控3D头像生成。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: HR-LVLMs通过裁剪高分辨率图像为局部图块进行细粒度视觉理解，但会产生大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大。本文提出HERO框架，通过重要性评估和功能感知的token选择，实现训练自由的高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视觉语言模型(HR-LVLMs)通过分治策略处理高分辨率图像，但产生大量视觉token导致显著的计算和内存开销，需要寻找高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出HERO框架：基于内容自适应token预算分配和功能感知token选择，通过评估图块重要性和选择性保留具有互补作用的视觉token，实现高效推理。

Result: HERO在不同基准测试和模型规模上实现了优越的效率-准确性权衡，且无需训练即可应用。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过智能token选择显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Motivation: 传统傅里叶频率信息拟合使用逐像素损失函数，过度关注局部信息可能导致全局信息丢失，需要更有效的傅里叶域信息对齐方法。

Method: 提出LLFDisc U形深度增强网络，集成交叉注意力和门控机制；设计分布感知损失函数，使用闭式KL散度目标最小化傅里叶域信息差异；增强基于VGG的感知损失，在提取的深度特征中嵌入KL散度。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和增强的感知损失机制，有效解决了傅里叶域信息拟合问题，在图像增强任务中表现出优异性能。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要理解动态环境中的运动，但运动标注成本高昂。室外场景通常包含移动前景和静态背景，运动理解可与场景解析关联，因此探索用更易获得的前景/背景标注来替代运动标注

Conclusion: 通过将运动预测与场景解析关联，提出的弱监督和自监督方法有效减少了标注需求，同时保持了良好的运动预测性能，为自动驾驶运动理解提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

Conclusion: MSDNet框架有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨的准确性与效率平衡问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong

sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

TL;DR: Vi-SAFE是一个用于视频监控中暴力检测的时空框架，结合改进的YOLOv8和时序分割网络，在RWF-2000数据集上达到88%的准确率，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公共监控中暴力检测面临的挑战，包括小尺度目标、复杂环境和实时时序分析需求，提升公共安全监控效果。

Method: 提出Vi-SAFE框架：使用GhostNetV3作为轻量化骨干网络优化YOLOv8，加入EMA注意力机制和剪枝技术降低计算成本；YOLOv8用于提取人体区域，TSN进行暴力行为二分类，两者分别训练。

Result: 在RWF-2000数据集上实验显示，Vi-SAFE准确率达到0.88，显著优于单独使用TSN的0.77，在准确率和效率方面都超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Vi-SAFE框架有效解决了公共监控暴力检测的关键挑战，在保持精度的同时降低了计算成本，为公共安全监控提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This
study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments,
and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal
framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as
a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention
mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy.
YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets,
where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of
violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE
achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming
existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its
effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出End4方法检测扩散修复图像，通过去噪重建模型和尺度感知金字塔融合模块提升检测性能，建立包含五种掩码区域的基准测试


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成和修复方面能力强大，但存在被恶意使用的风险。现有方法难以检测基于扩散的修复图像，即使训练数据中包含类似修复图像

Method: End4方法设计去噪重建模型改善重建和检测过程的潜在空间对齐，利用尺度感知金字塔融合模块(SPFM)在不同尺度注意力金字塔层指导下细化局部图像特征

Result: 大量实验表明End4能有效泛化到未见过的掩码模式，并在各种扰动下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: End4方法在检测扩散修复图像方面表现优异，具有良好泛化能力和鲁棒性，代码和数据集将发布

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated
images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical
use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via

accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyleSculptor是一种无需训练的方法，通过内容图像和风格图像生成风格可控的3D资产，使用新颖的Style Disentangled Attention模块实现细粒度的纹理和几何风格控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention模块，通过跨3D注意力机制建立内容和风格图像的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来分离风格和内容特征。

Result: 实验表明StyleSculptor在生成高保真3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了零样本的风格引导3D生成，提供了细粒度的风格控制能力，为3D内容创作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

TL;DR: SR-3D是一个空间区域感知的视觉语言模型，通过共享视觉标记空间连接单视图2D图像和多视图3D数据，支持灵活的3D区域提示，无需多帧标注即可实现准确的空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统方法需要多帧标注的繁琐问题，以及实现2D和3D表示空间的统一，使模型能够利用强大的2D先验知识进行跨帧空间推理。

Method: 通过用3D位置嵌入丰富2D视觉特征，构建共享视觉标记空间，支持边界框、分割掩码等多种区域提示方式，无需多帧标注即可实现3D空间理解。

Result: 在通用2D视觉语言和专门3D空间基准测试中达到最先进性能，能够准确推断空间关系和度量测量，即使在无3D输入或标注的野外视频中也表现良好。

Conclusion: SR-3D有效统一了2D和3D表示空间，为场景理解提供了强大的工具，展示了在缺乏3D数据情况下进行准确空间推理的潜力。

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荷兰语在多语言嵌入资源中代表性不足，通常只占已发布资源的一小部分，需要专门的资源和工具来支持荷兰语嵌入技术的发展。

Method: 1) 创建MTEB-NL基准测试，包含现有荷兰语数据集和新创建的数据集；2) 提供训练数据集，整合可用荷兰语检索数据集并使用大语言模型生成合成数据；3) 发布紧凑高效的E5-NL嵌入模型系列。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了荷兰语嵌入资源的空白，为荷兰语嵌入技术的进一步发展提供了重要基础，通过公开资源鼓励社区参与和发展。

Abstract: Recently, embedding resources, including models, benchmarks, and datasets,
have been widely released to support a variety of languages. However, the Dutch
language remains underrepresented, typically comprising only a small fraction
of the published multilingual resources. To address this gap and encourage the
further development of Dutch embeddings, we introduce new resources for their
evaluation and generation. First, we introduce the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark for Dutch (MTEB-NL), which includes both existing Dutch datasets and
newly created ones, covering a wide range of tasks. Second, we provide a
training dataset compiled from available Dutch retrieval datasets, complemented
with synthetic data generated by large language models to expand task coverage
beyond retrieval. Finally, we release a series of E5-NL models compact yet
efficient embedding models that demonstrate strong performance across multiple
tasks. We make our resources publicly available through the Hugging Face Hub
and the MTEB package.

*Matteo Marcuzzo,Alessandro Zangari,Andrea Albarelli,Jose Camacho-Collados,Mohammad Taher Pilehvar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MORABLES是一个基于寓言和短篇故事的人类验证基准测试，用于评估LLM的道德推理能力，发现大型模型虽然表现更好但仍易受对抗性攻击，存在显著的自相矛盾问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在标准阅读理解基准上的优异表现，研究重点转向评估其复杂抽象推理和推理能力，特别是道德推理等深层理解技能。

Method: 构建MORABLES基准测试，包含从历史文学中提取的寓言和短篇故事，采用多项选择题形式测试道德推理，并设计对抗性变体来测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: 大型模型表现优于小型模型，但易受对抗性操纵，约20%的情况下会自相矛盾，推理增强模型未能弥补这一差距，表明规模而非推理能力是性能主要驱动力。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在道德推理方面存在脆弱性，主要依赖表面模式而非真正的道德推理，需要开发更可靠的评估方法和改进模型推理能力。

Abstract: As LLMs excel on standard reading comprehension benchmarks, attention is
shifting toward evaluating their capacity for complex abstract reasoning and
inference. Literature-based benchmarks, with their rich narrative and moral
depth, provide a compelling framework for evaluating such deeper comprehension
skills. Here, we present MORABLES, a human-verified benchmark built from fables
and short stories drawn from historical literature. The main task is structured
as multiple-choice questions targeting moral inference, with carefully crafted
distractors that challenge models to go beyond shallow, extractive question
answering. To further stress-test model robustness, we introduce adversarial
variants designed to surface LLM vulnerabilities and shortcuts due to issues
such as data contamination. Our findings show that, while larger models
outperform smaller ones, they remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation
and often rely on superficial patterns rather than true moral reasoning. This
brittleness results in significant self-contradiction, with the best models
refuting their own answers in roughly 20% of cases depending on the framing of
the moral choice. Interestingly, reasoning-enhanced models fail to bridge this
gap, suggesting that scale - not reasoning ability - is the primary driver of
performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究使用LLM作为评估者来评估法律检索增强生成系统，发现传统评估指标在AI系统评估中存在误导性，提出使用Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数作为更稳健的评估指标，以及使用Wilcoxon符号秩检验进行系统比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的兴起，传统评估指标无法捕捉法律研究等专业领域的细微质量维度，需要探索LLM作为可靠评估者的可行性，以解决推荐系统评估瓶颈问题。

Method: 通过系统实验研究两个关键问题：哪种评估者间可靠性指标最能捕捉LLM与人类评估的一致性，以及如何进行统计上可靠的系统比较。使用Krippendorff's alpha、Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数等指标进行对比分析。

Result: 发现传统一致性指标如Krippendorff's alpha在AI系统评估的偏斜分布中具有误导性，Gwet's AC2和秩相关系数是更稳健的评估者选择指标，Wilcoxon符号秩检验配合Benjamini-Hochberg校正能提供可靠的系统比较统计严谨性。

Conclusion: 研究为法律应用提供了一条可扩展、成本效益高的评估路径，将传统人力密集的评估瓶颈转变为自动化且统计原理严谨的评估框架，使LLM作为评估者在高风险的推荐质量评估中具有实用可行性。

Abstract: The evaluation bottleneck in recommendation systems has become particularly
acute with the rise of Generative AI, where traditional metrics fall short of
capturing nuanced quality dimensions that matter in specialized domains like
legal research. Can we trust Large Language Models to serve as reliable judges
of their own kind? This paper investigates LLM-as-a-Judge as a principled
approach to evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems in legal
contexts, where the stakes of recommendation quality are exceptionally high.
  We tackle two fundamental questions that determine practical viability: which
inter-rater reliability metrics best capture the alignment between LLM and
human assessments, and how do we conduct statistically sound comparisons
between competing systems? Through systematic experimentation, we discover that
traditional agreement metrics like Krippendorff's alpha can be misleading in
the skewed distributions typical of AI system evaluations. Instead, Gwet's AC2
and rank correlation coefficients emerge as more robust indicators for judge
selection, while the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test with Benjamini-Hochberg
corrections provides the statistical rigor needed for reliable system
comparisons.
  Our findings suggest a path toward scalable, cost-effective evaluation that
maintains the precision demanded by legal applications, transforming what was
once a human-intensive bottleneck into an automated, yet statistically
principled, evaluation framework.

Result: 在3个公开数据集24个文本域上的实验显示，SENTRA在跨域设置中显著优于流行基线方法

Conclusion: SENTRA是一个通用的分类器，能有效检测LLM生成的文本

Abstract: LLMs are becoming increasingly capable and widespread. Consequently, the
potential and reality of their misuse is also growing. In this work, we address
the problem of detecting LLM-generated text that is not explicitly declared as
such. We present a novel, general-purpose, and supervised LLM text detector,
SElected-Next-Token tRAnsformer (SENTRA). SENTRA is a Transformer-based encoder
leveraging selected-next-token-probability sequences and utilizing contrastive
pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data. Our experiments on three
popular public datasets across 24 domains of text demonstrate SENTRA is a
general-purpose classifier that significantly outperforms popular baselines in
the out-of-domain setting.

Motivation: 医疗领域的自然语言生成评估面临独特挑战，传统自动评估指标在区分高质量输出方面存在不足，特别是在开放式医疗问答任务中

Method: 引入MORQA基准，包含英语和中文的医疗视觉和文本问答数据集，每个问题有2-4个以上医学专家撰写的参考答案，并使用专家人工评分。比较传统指标和基于LLM的评估方法

Result: 基于LLM的评估方法（如GPT-4和Gemini）在相关性方面显著优于传统指标，LLM对语义细微差别敏感且对参考答案变异性具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 这是医疗领域首个全面的多语言NLG评估定性研究，强调了需要与人类判断对齐的评估方法，所有数据集和标注将公开发布以支持未来研究

Abstract: Evaluating natural language generation (NLG) systems in the medical domain
presents unique challenges due to the critical demands for accuracy, relevance,
and domain-specific expertise. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics, such
as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, often fall short in distinguishing between
high-quality outputs, especially given the open-ended nature of medical
question answering (QA) tasks where multiple valid responses may exist. In this
work, we introduce MORQA (Medical Open-Response QA), a new multilingual
benchmark designed to assess the effectiveness of NLG evaluation metrics across
three medical visual and text-based QA datasets in English and Chinese. Unlike
prior resources, our datasets feature 2-4+ gold-standard answers authored by
medical professionals, along with expert human ratings for three English and
Chinese subsets. We benchmark both traditional metrics and large language model
(LLM)-based evaluators, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, finding that LLM-based
approaches significantly outperform traditional metrics in correlating with
expert judgments. We further analyze factors driving this improvement,
including LLMs' sensitivity to semantic nuances and robustness to variability
among reference answers. Our results provide the first comprehensive,
multilingual qualitative study of NLG evaluation in the medical domain,
highlighting the need for human-aligned evaluation methods. All datasets and
annotations will be publicly released to support future research.

Motivation: 现有基准在医疗领域的数据范围有限，无法捕捉真实世界医疗信息的复杂性，需要更严格的评估标准来确保LLMs在医疗应用中的事实可靠性。

Method: 采用混合AI-人类框架，通过迭代专家反馈优化AI驱动的多标准筛选过程，构建高质量且具有挑战性的数据集。评估了20个领先LLMs在真实性分类和错误定位方面的表现。

Result: 研究发现模型虽然能判断文本是否包含错误，但精确定位错误仍具有挑战性，即使表现最好的模型也达不到人类专家水平。还发现了'过度批评'现象，即模型倾向于将正确信息误判为错误。

Conclusion: MedFact揭示了LLMs在医疗应用中面临的关键挑战，为开发更可靠和医学感知的模型提供了重要资源，强调了在医疗领域部署LLMs时需要解决的事实可靠性问题。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare
necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their factual reliability. However,
existing benchmarks are often limited by narrow domains of data, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world medical information. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MedFact, a new and challenging benchmark for Chinese
medical fact-checking. MedFact comprises 2,116 expert-annotated instances
curated from diverse real-world texts, spanning 13 medical specialties, 8
fine-grained error types, 4 writing styles, and multiple difficulty levels. Its
construction employs a hybrid AI-human framework where iterative expert
feedback refines an AI-driven, multi-criteria filtering process, ensuring both
high data quality and difficulty. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20
leading LLMs, benchmarking their performance on veracity classification and
error localization against a human expert baseline. Our results reveal that
while models can often determine if a text contains an error, precisely
localizing it remains a substantial challenge, with even top-performing models
falling short of human performance. Furthermore, our analysis uncovers a
frequent ``over-criticism'' phenomenon, a tendency for models to misidentify
correct information as erroneous, which is exacerbated by advanced reasoning
techniques such as multi-agent collaboration and inference-time scaling. By
highlighting these critical challenges for deploying LLMs in medical
applications, MedFact provides a robust resource to drive the development of
more factually reliable and medically aware models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于嵌入相似度或生成概率检索演示样本，往往导致选择不相关或冗余的示例，无法全面覆盖测试输入所需的细粒度知识要求。

Method: 提出TopicK框架：1）估计输入所需的主题知识；2）评估模型在这些主题上的知识水平；3）迭代选择能够引入模型知识薄弱且未被覆盖主题的演示样本。

Result: 在多个数据集和开源/闭源大语言模型上的广泛实验验证了TopicK的有效性。

Conclusion: TopicK通过主题覆盖的检索方法显著提升了上下文学习的效果，能够更全面地满足测试输入的知识需求。

Abstract: The effectiveness of in-context learning relies heavily on selecting
demonstrations that provide all the necessary information for a given test
input. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify and cover fine-grained
knowledge requirements. However, prior methods often retrieve demonstrations
based solely on embedding similarity or generation probability, resulting in
irrelevant or redundant examples. In this paper, we propose TopicK, a topic
coverage-based retrieval framework that selects demonstrations to
comprehensively cover topic-level knowledge relevant to both the test input and
the model. Specifically, TopicK estimates the topics required by the input and
assesses the model's knowledge on those topics. TopicK then iteratively selects
demonstrations that introduce previously uncovered required topics, in which
the model exhibits low topical knowledge. We validate the effectiveness of
TopicK through extensive experiments across various datasets and both open- and
closed-source LLMs. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 随着语言模型在教育技术中的广泛应用，需要确保其与人类语言理解的一致性，特别是在联合国SDG 4强调语言清晰度的教育背景下

Method: 使用新提出的LUCID数据集（包含英语和孟加拉语句对）和RECISE评估指南，通过皮尔逊相关系数、斯皮尔曼相关系数、平均绝对误差和新型HCE准确度指标评估多个SOTA模型

Result: Compound-Beta表现最均衡，在英语中皮尔逊相关系数最高，在混合语言数据上表现稳健，显示出与人类判断的强一致性

Conclusion: 语言模型在精细语言现象处理上仍需改进，Compound-Beta在跨语言场景中表现出最佳的人类对齐能力，为教育技术应用提供了重要参考

Abstract: Despite advances in natural language generation and understanding, LM still
struggle with fine grained linguistic phenomena such as tense, negation, voice,
and modality which are the elements central to effective human communication.
In the context of the United Nations SDG 4, where linguistic clarity is
critical, the deployment of LMs in educational technologies demands careful
scrutiny. As LMs are increasingly powering applications like tutoring systems,
automated grading, and translation, their alignment with human linguistic
interpretation becomes essential for effective learning. In this study, we
conduct a evaluation of SOTA language models across these challenging contexts
in both English and Bengali. To ensure a structured assessment, we introduce a
new Route for Evaluation of Cognitive Inference in Systematic Environments
guidelines. Our proposed LUCID dataset, composed of carefully crafted sentence
pairs in English and Bengali, specifically challenges these models on critical
aspects of language comprehension, including negation, tense, voice variations.
We assess the performance of SOTA models including MISTRAL-SABA-24B,
LLaMA-4-Scout-17B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Gemma2-9B, and Compound-Beta using standard
metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and Mean Absolute
Error, as well as novel, linguistically inspired metric the HCE accuracy. The
HCE accuracy measures how often model predictions fall within one standard
deviation of the mean human rating, thus capturing human like tolerance for
variability in language interpretation. Our findings highlight Compound-Beta as
the most balanced model, consistently achieving high correlations and low MAEs
across diverse language conditions. It records the highest Pearson correlation
in English and demonstrates robust performance on mixed-language data,
indicating a strong alignment with human judgments in cross lingual scenarios.

TL;DR: R2tA方法通过提炼大语言模型的推理轨迹来训练任务特定的小型推理模型，解决了数据稀缺领域的高质量监督信号问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在直接人工监督或高质量标签稀缺的情况下，训练任务特定的小型推理模型具有挑战性。大语言模型产生的丰富中间推理轨迹可以被系统提炼，为训练提供有效的监督信号。

Method: 提出Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA)方法：1) 从开源基础模型生成初始推理和响应；2) 提炼这些轨迹，修复幻觉和不一致性，形成高质量数据集；3) 进行两阶段对齐：监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)，校准模型的中间推理。

Result: 在数据库系统设计的扩展实体关系图(EERD)评估任务上，R2tA方法在600个EERD变体数据集(450训练/150测试)上表现优异，解决了提示方法的幻觉和错误遗漏问题。

Conclusion: R2tA为数据稀缺领域的大语言模型适应提供了实用且成本效益高的路径，为教育等领域的可重现AI工具开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Training a task-specific small reasoning model is challenging when direct
human supervision or high-quality labels are scarce. However, LLMs with
reasoning capabilities produce abundant intermediate reasoning traces that can
be systematically refined to create effective supervision signals. We propose
Reason-Refine-then-Align (R2tA), which turns refined model rationales into
supervision for training task-specific reasoning models. Our method generates
initial reasoning and responses from an open-source base model on task-specific
inputs, then refines these traces, fixing hallucinations and inconsistencies,
to form a high-fidelity dataset. We perform a two-stage alignment, supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), followed by direct preference optimization (DPO) to
calibrate the model's intermediate reasoning with human-validated conceptual
preferences and then condition the final output on that aligned reasoning. As a
case study, we apply R2tA to evaluate extended entity relationship diagrams
(EERDs) in database system design, a structurally complex task where
prompt-only methods miss or hallucinate errors. We curated a dataset of 600
EERD variants (train/test split of 450/150, respectively) with induced mistakes
spanning 11 categories. Empirical evaluation suggests R2tA provides a
practical, cost-effective path to scalable LLM adaptation in data-scarce
domains, enabling reproducible AI tools for education and beyond.

Motivation: 虽然基于LLM的ASR系统在开源基准测试中表现良好，但在实际工业评估集上往往表现不佳，且LLM容易产生幻觉问题，影响用户体验。

Method: 结合海量数据、大模型容量、LLM集成和强化学习，针对流式处理、噪声鲁棒性、代码切换、热词定制等实际应用需求进行优化。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了生产导向优化的重要性，FunAudio-ASR系统能够有效解决LLM幻觉问题，在各种复杂语音识别场景中表现出色，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: In recent years, automatic speech recognition (ASR) has witnessed
transformative advancements driven by three complementary paradigms: data
scaling, model size scaling, and deep integration with large language models
(LLMs). However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, which can significantly
degrade user experience in real-world ASR applications. In this paper, we
present FunAudio-ASR, a large-scale, LLM-based ASR system that synergistically
combines massive data, large model capacity, LLM integration, and reinforcement
learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across diverse and complex
speech recognition scenarios. Moreover, FunAudio-ASR is specifically optimized
for practical deployment, with enhancements in streaming capability, noise
robustness, code-switching, hotword customization, and satisfying other
real-world application requirements. Experimental results show that while most
LLM-based ASR systems achieve strong performance on open-source benchmarks,
they often underperform on real industry evaluation sets. Thanks to
production-oriented optimizations, FunAudio-ASR achieves SOTA performance on
real application datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in
practical settings.

*Chiara Bonfanti,Michele Colombino,Giulia Coucourde,Faeze Memari,Stefano Pinardi,Rosa Meo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较三种Bambara语机器翻译管道：简单Transformer、LLaMA3微调、LaBSE语言蒸馏。简单Transformer在Bayelemagaba数据集上获得最佳翻译效果（10% BLEU, 21% chrF），在Yiri数据集上达到33.81% BLEU和41% chrF。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为低资源语言Bambara（非洲曼德语系，约1418万使用者）开发有效的机器翻译系统，比较不同训练管道的性能。

Method: 1) 简单Transformer法语到Bambara翻译；2) LLaMA3（3B-8B）解码器架构微调；3) LaBSE语言蒸馏+BERT扩展。使用不同超参数组合优化BLEU和chrF分数，在Dokotoro（医学）和Bayelemagaba（混合领域）数据集测试。

Result: 简单管道表现最佳：Bayelemagaba上10% BLEU和21% chrF，Yiri数据集上33.81% BLEU和41% chrF。基于指导的模型在单一数据集上表现优于聚合数据集，表明其能更好捕捉数据集特定模式。

Conclusion: 对于低资源语言翻译，简单的Transformer架构反而能取得最佳性能，复杂模型如LLaMA3微调在特定数据集上表现良好但泛化能力有限。

Abstract: This work compares three pipelines for training transformer-based neural
networks to produce machine translators for Bambara, a Mand\`e language spoken
in Africa by about 14,188,850 people. The first pipeline trains a simple
transformer to translate sentences from French into Bambara. The second
fine-tunes LLaMA3 (3B-8B) instructor models using decoder-only architectures
for French-to-Bambara translation. Models from the first two pipelines were
trained with different hyperparameter combinations to improve BLEU and chrF
scores, evaluated on both test sentences and official Bambara benchmarks. The
third pipeline uses language distillation with a student-teacher dual neural
network to integrate Bambara into a pre-trained LaBSE model, which provides
language-agnostic embeddings. A BERT extension is then applied to LaBSE to
generate translations. All pipelines were tested on Dokotoro (medical) and
Bayelemagaba (mixed domains). Results show that the first pipeline, although
simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on
Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results. On the Yiri
dataset, created for this work, it achieves 33.81% BLEU and 41% chrF.
Instructor-based models perform better on single datasets than on aggregated
collections, suggesting they capture dataset-specific patterns more
effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本自动音频字幕生成系统，利用预训练模型避免大量训练，通过音频CLIP提取特征并生成结构化提示来指导LLM生成字幕，相比传统方法在NLG平均分数上提升了35%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动音频字幕生成面临数据集有限的问题，相比图像字幕生成数据量不足，需要克服这一限制

Method: 使用预训练音频CLIP模型提取听觉特征并生成结构化提示，指导大型语言模型生成字幕，通过音频CLIP模型优化token选择以确保与音频内容对齐

Result: 实验结果显示使用MAGIC搜索和WavCaps模型时，NLG平均分数从4.7提升到7.3，提升了35%。性能受音频-文本匹配模型和关键词选择影响很大，单关键词提示效果最佳，无关键词列表时性能下降50%

Conclusion: 零样本方法在自动音频字幕生成中表现优异，预训练模型的组合使用可以有效克服数据限制问题，关键词选择和音频-文本匹配对性能至关重要

Abstract: Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces
challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome
this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models,
eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained
audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt,
which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike
traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the
audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental
results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using
MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by
the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results
achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no
keyword list is used.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EconProver方法，通过动态CoT切换机制和多样化并行强化学习，在保持定理证明性能的同时将计算成本降低至基线的12%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在自动定理证明中采用测试时扩展策略（如反射式CoT推理和增加采样次数）虽然提升了性能，但带来了巨大的计算开销，且现有成本分析忽略了不同扩展策略带来的采样成本差异

Method: 提出了两种互补方法：1）动态CoT切换机制以减少不必要的token消耗；2）多样化并行扩展的强化学习与可训练前缀，在有限采样次数下提升通过率。这些方法可集成到统一的EconRL流程中

Result: 在miniF2F和ProofNet数据集上的实验表明，EconProver在仅使用基线方法12%计算成本的情况下，达到了可比的性能表现

Conclusion: 这项工作为部署轻量级自动定理证明模型而不牺牲性能提供了可行的见解，显著提高了推理效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently advanced the field of Automated
Theorem Proving (ATP), attaining substantial performance gains through widely
adopted test-time scaling strategies, notably reflective Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and increased sampling passes. However, they both introduce
significant computational overhead for inference. Moreover, existing cost
analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while
neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by
different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the
efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and
demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source
approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage
and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we
propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL
pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching
mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse
parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance
pass rates under constrained sampling passes. Experiments on miniF2F and
ProofNet demonstrate that our EconProver achieves comparable performance to
baseline methods with only 12% of the computational cost. This work provides
actionable insights for deploying lightweight ATP models without sacrificing
performance.

TL;DR: RoPE存在距离依赖偏差限制长上下文建模能力，本文提出TAPA方法通过可学习相位函数改进位置编码，在长上下文任务上表现优于RoPE系列方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) 在注意力分数中引入了内在的距离依赖偏差，限制了其建模长上下文的能力，现有扩展方法需要预训练后调整

Method: 提出Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA)，在注意力机制中融入可学习相位函数的位置编码方法

Result: TAPA能够保持长距离token交互，通过轻量微调扩展到更长上下文，外推到未见长度，在长上下文任务上获得显著更低的困惑度

Conclusion: TAPA是优于RoPE系列的位置编码方法，能够有效解决长上下文建模问题

Abstract: We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE)
introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits
RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this
issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such
as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware
Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a
learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token
interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light
fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower
perplexity on long-context than RoPE families.

TL;DR: 提出发音感知上下文框架(PAC)，通过两阶段学习方法解决LLM-ASR中的发音建模和同音词区分问题，显著降低词错误率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型ASR系统中发音建模不足和同音词区分困难的问题，特别是对生僻词和长尾词的识别

Method: 采用两阶段学习范式：1)发音引导的上下文学习方法，使用交错字素-音素上下文建模策略；2)发音区分性强化学习方法，通过扰动标签采样增强同音词区分能力

Result: 在Librispeech和AISHELL-1数据集上，相比预训练LLM-ASR模型分别降低相对WER 30.2%和53.8%，长尾词偏置WER相对降低31.8%和60.5%

Conclusion: PAC框架有效提升了ASR系统的发音建模能力和同音词区分性能，特别在长尾词识别方面表现优异

Abstract: This paper presents a Pronunciation-Aware Contextualized (PAC) framework to
address two key challenges in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems: effective pronunciation modeling and robust
homophone discrimination. Both are essential for raw or long-tail word
recognition. The proposed approach adopts a two-stage learning paradigm. First,
we introduce a pronunciation-guided context learning method. It employs an
interleaved grapheme-phoneme context modeling strategy that incorporates
grapheme-only distractors, encouraging the model to leverage phonemic cues for
accurate recognition. Then, we propose a pronunciation-discriminative
reinforcement learning method with perturbed label sampling to further enhance
the model\'s ability to distinguish contextualized homophones. Experimental
results on the public English Librispeech and Mandarin AISHELL-1 datasets
indicate that PAC: (1) reduces relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 30.2% and
53.8% compared to pre-trained LLM-based ASR models, and (2) achieves 31.8% and
60.5% relative reductions in biased WER for long-tail words compared to strong
baselines, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种检测大型语言模型意识形态偏见的方法，通过分析模型输出在不同主题提示下的分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控，适用于黑盒系统的审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在数百万用户产品中的广泛应用，其输出可能影响个人信念和公共舆论。如果LLMs可以被有意引导到特定意识形态立场，控制这些系统的实体可能对公共话语产生不成比例的影响。

Method: 采用先前提出的统计方法，适应意识形态偏见审计的新背景。该方法具有模型无关性设计，不需要访问语言模型内部，而是通过分析模型在选定主题相关提示下的输出分布变化来识别潜在的意识形态操控。

Result: 通过一系列实验验证了该方法的有效性，证明了其实际适用性和支持对LLM行为进行独立事后审计的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法为检测大型语言模型中的意识形态操控提供了一种有效的工具，特别适合对专有黑盒系统进行审计，有助于确保AI系统的透明度和问责制。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in products used
by millions, their outputs may influence individual beliefs and, cumulatively,
shape public opinion. If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered
toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views,
then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over
public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can
reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such
steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop
methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt
a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias
auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original
framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language
model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing
distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically
related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable
for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a
series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its
potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过强化学习缓解大语言模型在情感支持对话中策略规划偏好偏差的方法，通过双奖励函数优化策略规划的准确性和置信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在情感支持对话中存在策略规划准确性低和明显偏好偏差的问题，现有方法虽然通过微调策略规划器减少了偏差，但偏差的根本原因尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 首先揭示大语言模型在策略规划中的知识边界，然后提出基于强化学习的双奖励函数方法，根据知识边界通过准确性和基于熵的置信度来优化策略规划。

Result: 在ESCov和ExTES数据集上的多个大语言模型骨干网络实验表明，该方法优于基线方法，证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功缓解了大语言模型在情感支持对话中的策略规划偏好偏差，通过识别知识边界并采用双奖励函数优化，显著提升了策略规划的性能。

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate distress through
empathetic dialogue, yet large language models (LLMs) face persistent
challenges in delivering effective ESC due to low accuracy in strategy
planning. Moreover, there is a considerable preference bias towards specific
strategies. Prior methods using fine-tuned strategy planners have shown
potential in reducing such bias, while the underlying causes of the preference
bias in LLMs have not well been studied. To address these issues, we first
reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge
boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to
mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which
optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for
each region according to the knowledge boundaries. Experiments on the ESCov and
ExTES datasets with multiple LLM backbones show that our approach outperforms
the baselines, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决文本行人搜索中高质量文本标注获取困难的问题，传统方法需要大量人工标注，限制了系统的可扩展性和实际部署。

Method: 使用多轮文本生成(MTG)模块通过与大语言模型模拟对话生成丰富的伪标签，以及多轮文本交互(MTI)模块在推理时通过对话式推理精炼用户查询。

Conclusion: 提出的统一无标注框架为文本行人搜索系统的可扩展和实际部署铺平了道路，解决了现实搜索场景中模糊、不完整或歧义描述的问题。

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from
large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical
value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the
labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which
limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two
complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text
Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues
with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without
manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic,
dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague,
incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in
real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and
annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy,
robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual
captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的在线内容激增，传统基于人类文本训练的毒性分类器面临误分类问题，现有防御策略被动且效果有限，需要主动识别和修复模型脆弱性。

Method: 使用微调的BERT和RoBERTa分类器，通过对抗攻击技术识别脆弱电路，然后抑制这些脆弱组件，在多样化数据集上进行测试。

Result: 发现模型存在对性能关键或易受攻击的特定注意力头，抑制脆弱头能提升对抗输入的性能，不同人口群体的脆弱性由不同注意力头负责。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升毒性检测模型的鲁棒性，为开发更具包容性的内容审核系统提供了重要见解，揭示了模型训练中的公平性和鲁棒性差距。

Abstract: The volume of machine-generated content online has grown dramatically due to
the widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to new challenges
for content moderation systems. Conventional content moderation classifiers,
which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from
misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data
and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence
tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial
training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim
to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute
to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic
interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa
classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups.
We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits.
Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against
adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these
vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training.
We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance
or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves
performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are
responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can
inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.

Motivation: 解决MBR解码依赖模型采样文本，难以捕捉域外知识的问题

Method: 使用案例决策理论，通过域数据示例来估计期望效用，结合MBR和CBDT解码

Result: 在7个域翻译任务和图像字幕任务上，MBR+CBDT组合优于单独MBR解码

Conclusion: CBDT解码能有效提升跨域文本生成质量，是MBR解码的有力补充

Abstract: Minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding is a decision rule of text generation,
which selects the hypothesis that maximizes the expected utility and robustly
generates higher-quality texts than maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding.
However, it depends on sample texts drawn from the text generation model; thus,
it is difficult to find a hypothesis that correctly captures the knowledge or
information of out-of-domain. To tackle this issue, we propose case-based
decision-theoretic (CBDT) decoding, another method to estimate the expected
utility using examples of domain data. CBDT decoding not only generates
higher-quality texts than MAP decoding, but also the combination of MBR and
CBDT decoding outperformed MBR decoding in seven domain De--En and
Ja$\leftrightarrow$En translation tasks and image captioning tasks on MSCOCO
and nocaps datasets.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning about historical events is a critical skill for NLP tasks
like event extraction, historical entity linking, temporal question answering,
timeline summarization, temporal event clustering and temporal natural language
inference. Yet efforts on benchmarking temporal reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) are rather limited. Existing temporal reasoning datasets
are limited in scale, lack multilingual coverage and focus more on contemporary
events. To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual
database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and
article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both
historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning
across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA
reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models
(LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their
performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer
types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models. Our
work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for advancing multilingual and
temporally-aware natural language understanding of historical events. To
facilitate further research, we will make our code and datasets publicly
available upon acceptance of this paper.

investigate 1. The extent to which VLMs have this concept abstraction capacity,
and 2. Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images
that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this
capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped
image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image
captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level
conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the
model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the
information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main
contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image
contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which
measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our
training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept
abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed
to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training
forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic
representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the
higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that
this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in
abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的"自下而上"数据驱动框架，通过"检索优先、聚类结构化"策略，先建立知识边界再进行生成规划，有效解决长文档生成中的事实准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有"自上而下"方法在生成假设或大纲后再检索证据，容易导致模型计划与可用知识脱节，产生内容碎片化和事实不准确的问题。

Method: 采用"检索优先获取知识，聚类构建结构"策略：首先从知识库进行详尽迭代检索，然后使用无监督聚类算法将检索到的文档组织成不同的"知识簇"，这些簇为后续生成分层大纲和最终文档内容提供客观的数据驱动基础。

Result: 在14B和32B参数模型上的实验结果表明，该方法达到或超过了最先进基线的性能，在需要高保真度和结构连贯性的知识约束场景中展现出独特优势。

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成可靠、结构化的长文档提供了一个有效范例，为在高风险、知识密集型领域中构建更稳健的LLM应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable prowess in text
generation, yet producing long-form, factual documents grounded in extensive
external knowledge bases remains a significant challenge. Existing "top-down"
methods, which first generate a hypothesis or outline and then retrieve
evidence, often suffer from a disconnect between the model's plan and the
available knowledge, leading to content fragmentation and factual inaccuracies.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven
framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is
predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure"
strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source
corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform
exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an
unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into
distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven
foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical
outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the
generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source
material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and
fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on
both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is
expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios
that demand high fidelity and structural coherence. Our work presents an
effective paradigm for generating reliable, structured, long-form documents,
paving the way for more robust LLM applications in high-stakes,
knowledge-intensive domains.

Motivation: 马耳他语作为受罗曼语和日耳曼语影响的独特闪族语言，与阿拉伯语存在文字差异，研究是否可以利用阿拉伯语资源来弥补马耳他语NLP资源不足的问题

Method: 采用多种策略对齐阿拉伯语和马耳他语文本数据，包括不同音译方案和机器翻译方法，并引入了新的能更好表示马耳他语正字法的音译系统

Result: 阿拉伯语基础的增强技术能够显著有益于马耳他语NLP任务，在单语和多语模型上都取得了积极效果

Conclusion: 阿拉伯语资源可以有效支持马耳他语NLP，跨语言增强技术为解决低资源语言处理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Maltese is a unique Semitic language that has evolved under extensive
influence from Romance and Germanic languages, particularly Italian and
English. Despite its Semitic roots, its orthography is based on the Latin
script, creating a gap between it and its closest linguistic relatives in
Arabic. In this paper, we explore whether Arabic-language resources can support
Maltese natural language processing (NLP) through cross-lingual augmentation
techniques. We investigate multiple strategies for aligning Arabic textual data
with Maltese, including various transliteration schemes and machine translation
(MT) approaches. As part of this, we also introduce novel transliteration
systems that better represent Maltese orthography. We evaluate the impact of
these augmentations on monolingual and mutlilingual models and demonstrate that
Arabic-based augmentation can significantly benefit Maltese NLP tasks.

Motivation: 多媒体内容激增需要有效的多媒体事件抽取系统，但大型视觉语言模型在此任务上的应用潜力尚未充分探索

Method: 在M2E2数据集上评估代表性LVLMs（DeepSeek-VL2和Qwen-VL系列），涵盖文本、图像和跨媒体子任务，采用few-shot提示和微调设置

Result: few-shot LVLMs在视觉任务表现更好但文本任务困难；LoRA微调显著提升性能；多模态组合展现强协同效应，在跨模态设置中达到优越性能

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs在M2E2任务中的潜力和局限性，指出了语义精度、定位和跨模态基础等持续挑战，为推进M2E2能力提供了重要见解

Abstract: The proliferation of multimedia content necessitates the development of
effective Multimedia Event Extraction (M2E2) systems. Though Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong cross-modal capabilities,
their utility in the M2E2 task remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
the first systematic evaluation of representative LVLMs, including DeepSeek-VL2
and the Qwen-VL series, on the M2E2 dataset. Our evaluations cover text-only,
image-only, and cross-media subtasks, assessed under both few-shot prompting
and fine-tuning settings. Our key findings highlight the following valuable
insights: (1) Few-shot LVLMs perform notably better on visual tasks but
struggle significantly with textual tasks; (2) Fine-tuning LVLMs with LoRA
substantially enhances model performance; and (3) LVLMs exhibit strong synergy
when combining modalities, achieving superior performance in cross-modal
settings. We further provide a detailed error analysis to reveal persistent
challenges in areas such as semantic precision, localization, and cross-modal
grounding, which remain critical obstacles for advancing M2E2 capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖重复响应采样、辅助模型或微调目标模型，计算成本高且可能影响通用性，需要更高效准确的难度估计方法

Method: 将token级生成过程建模为马尔可夫链，定义价值函数来估计给定隐藏状态的预期输出质量，仅基于初始隐藏状态进行难度估计

Result: 在文本和多模态任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在难度估计方面始终优于现有基线，并能以更少的生成token实现更高的推理效率

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种计算高效且通用的难度估计解决方案，可用于指导自适应推理策略，提高LLM的推理效率

Abstract: Estimating the difficulty of input questions as perceived by large language
models (LLMs) is essential for accurate performance evaluation and adaptive
inference. Existing methods typically rely on repeated response sampling,
auxiliary models, or fine-tuning the target model itself, which may incur
substantial computational costs or compromise generality. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for difficulty estimation that leverages only the
hidden representations produced by the target LLM. We model the token-level
generation process as a Markov chain and define a value function to estimate
the expected output quality given any hidden state. This allows for efficient
and accurate difficulty estimation based solely on the initial hidden state,
without generating any output tokens. Extensive experiments across both textual
and multimodal tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing baselines in difficulty estimation. Moreover, we apply our difficulty
estimates to guide adaptive reasoning strategies, including Self-Consistency,
Best-of-N, and Self-Refine, achieving higher inference efficiency with fewer
generated tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM微调方法（如LoRA）在文本嵌入任务中存在数据和训练差距问题，需要开发专门针对嵌入任务优化的模型架构和训练策略。

Method: 1) 添加新闻数据和多语言对进行预训练以弥补数据差距；2) 提出跨语言检索数据集；3) 引入软掩码机制在因果掩码和双向掩码之间平滑过渡；4) 提出动态硬负样本挖掘方法。

Conclusion: 通过专门设计的预训练数据、软掩码机制和动态负样本挖掘策略，即使只有14亿参数，也能在文本嵌入任务上实现卓越的跨语言性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated excellent performance
in text embedding tasks. Previous work usually use LoRA to fine-tune existing
LLMs, which are limited by the data and training gap between LLMs and embedding
models. In this work, we introduce Conan-embedding-v2, a new 1.4B-parameter LLM
trained from scratch and fine-tuned as a text embedder. First, we add news data
and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on
this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to
better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs
use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional
mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less
effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually
transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more
comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard
negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative
examples throughout the training process. Being intuitive and effective, with
only approximately 1.4B parameters, Conan-embedding-v2 achieves SOTA
performance on both the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) and Chinese
MTEB (May 19, 2025).

propose a set of training-free, graph-based confidence estimation methods

graphs and estimates confidence by exploiting graph properties such as
centrality, path convergence, and path weighting. Experiments with two LLMs on
three reasoning datasets demonstrate improved confidence estimation and
enhanced performance on two downstream tasks.

Abstract: The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the
reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science".
However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural
components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address
this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive,
structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case
study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric
approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to
identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772.
Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow
phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of
0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically
categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages
using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of
0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the
documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire
research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived
from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two
decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition
from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated
technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel,
process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving
scientific paradigms. Source code and data are available at:

Motivation: 研究ReLoRA在小语言模型预训练中的表现，探索参数高效方法在低计算成本环境下的适用性

Method: 通过消融实验系统评估ReLoRA在11M-66M参数SLMs上的性能和学习动态，比较损失、Paloma困惑度和BLiMP指标

Result: ReLoRA在所有评估指标上都比标准训练表现更差，且模型越大差距越明显；分析显示ReLoRA会加剧小模型的秩缺陷问题

Conclusion: 低秩更新策略不能简单迁移到小语言模型预训练中，需要在低计算资源环境下进行更多研究

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA have revolutionised the fine-tuning
of LLMs. Still, their extension to pretraining via ReLoRA is less well
understood, especially for small language models (SLMs), which offer lower
computational and environmental costs. This work is the first systematic study
of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and
learning dynamics. Through ablation experiments, we find that ReLoRA generally
performs worse than standard training on loss, Paloma perplexity and BLiMP,
with the gap widening for the larger models. Further analysis of the learning
dynamics of the models indicates that ReLoRA reinforces the rank deficiencies
found in smaller models. These results indicate that low-rank update strategies
may not transfer easily to SLM pretraining, highlighting the need for more
research in the low-compute regime.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
culture-aware language tasks. We introduce the novel problem of adapting wine
reviews across Chinese and English, which goes beyond literal translation by
incorporating regional taste preferences and culture-specific flavor
descriptors. In a case study on cross-cultural wine review adaptation, we
compile the first parallel corpus of professional reviews, containing 8k
Chinese and 16k Anglophone reviews. We benchmark both
neural-machine-translation baselines and state-of-the-art LLMs with automatic
metrics and human evaluation. For the latter, we propose three culture-oriented
criteria -- Cultural Proximity, Cultural Neutrality, and Cultural Genuineness
-- to assess how naturally a translated review resonates with target-culture
readers. Our analysis shows that current models struggle to capture cultural
nuances, especially in translating wine descriptions across different cultures.
This highlights the challenges and limitations of translation models in
handling cultural content.

Abstract: Poor sitting posture is a critical yet often overlooked factor contributing
to long-term musculoskeletal disorders and physiological dysfunctions. Existing
sitting posture monitoring systems, although leveraging visual, IMU, or
pressure-based modalities, often suffer from coarse-grained recognition and
lack the semantic expressiveness necessary for personalized feedback. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{SitLLM}, a lightweight multimodal framework that
integrates flexible pressure sensing with large language models (LLMs) to
enable fine-grained posture understanding and personalized health-oriented
response generation. SitLLM comprises three key components: (1) a
\textit{Gaussian-Robust Sensor Embedding Module} that partitions pressure maps
into spatial patches and injects local noise perturbations for robust feature
extraction; (2) a \textit{Prompt-Driven Cross-Modal Alignment Module} that
reprograms sensor embeddings into the LLM's semantic space via multi-head
cross-attention using the pre-trained vocabulary embeddings; and (3) a
\textit{Multi-Context Prompt Module} that fuses feature-level, structure-level,
statistical-level, and semantic-level contextual information to guide
instruction comprehension.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
many domains, yet their application to specialized fields remains constrained
by the scarcity and complexity of domain-specific training data. We present a
novel approach that achieves a 261x cost reduction for maritime intelligence by
using LLMs as one-time teachers rather than using them directly for inference.
Our method transforms 3.2 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel
tracking records into 21,543 synthetic question and answer pairs through
multi-model generation (GPT-4o and o3-mini), preventing overfitting and
ensuring accurate reasoning. The resulting fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model achieves
75% accuracy on maritime tasks, while being substantially cheaper than using a
larger model for inference. We show that smaller, cheaper models -- when fine
tuned properly -- can provide similar accuracy compared to larger models that
are prohibitively expensive. Our work contributes to the growing field of
synthetic dataset generation for specialized AI applications and presents a
highly reproducible framework for domains where manual annotation is
infeasible. Beyond expanding research in the growing field of specialized small
language models, our approach has immediate applications in maritime safety,
security operations, and vessel traffic management systems in various

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating human-like text,
aligning their outputs with complex, qualitative goals like pedagogical
soundness remains a significant challenge. Standard reinforcement learning
techniques often rely on slow and expensive LLM-as-a-judge evaluations or on
brittle, keyword-based metrics like ROUGE, which fail to capture the semantic
essence of a high-quality explanation. In this work, we introduce a novel
approach to reward shaping within the Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)
framework. Our central contribution is the use of a small, efficient
encoder-only transformer as a semantic reward model. This model provides a
dense, semantically rich reward signal based on the cosine similarity between a
generated explanation and a ground-truth reference, guiding the policy towards
explanations that are not just factually correct but also structurally and
conceptually aligned with expert reasoning. We apply this method to the task of
training a model for the Italian medical-school entrance examinations,
following standard domain-adaptive continued pre-training (CPT) and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our results demonstrate that GRPO with our proposed semantic
reward significantly improves explanation faithfulness and clarity over a
strong SFT baseline, showcasing the power of using lightweight encoder models
for nuanced reward shaping in complex generation tasks

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to the
development of LLM-based AI agents. A key challenge is the creation of agents
that can effectively ground themselves in complex, adversarial long-horizon
environments. Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to
interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions,
and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to
stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable
actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate
high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges,
we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning
framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon
environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill
library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill
planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized
skills into executable action sequences. We implement PLAP in MicroRTS, a
long-horizon real-time strategy game that provides an unfamiliar and
challenging environment for LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of PLAP. In particular, GPT-4o-driven PLAP in a zero-shot setting
outperforms 80% of baseline agents, and Qwen2-72B-driven PLAP, with carefully
crafted few-shot examples, surpasses the top-tier scripted agent, CoacAI.
Additionally, we design comprehensive evaluation metrics and test 6
closed-source and 2 open-source LLMs within the PLAP framework, ultimately
releasing an LLM leaderboard ranking long-horizon skill planning ability. Our
code is available at https://github.com/AI-Research-TeamX/PLAP.

TL;DR: HSAD是一种基于隐藏信号分析的幻觉检测框架，通过建模自回归生成过程中隐藏表示的时间动态，在频域分析中提取最强非直流频率分量作为特征，在多个基准测试中比现有方法提升10个百分点以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法存在局限性：事实性检查受外部知识覆盖范围限制，静态隐藏状态分析无法捕捉推理动态中的偏差，导致检测效果和鲁棒性有限。

Method: HSAD框架通过跨层采样激活构建隐藏层信号，应用快速傅里叶变换获得频域表示，提取最强非直流频率分量作为频谱特征，并利用LLMs的自回归特性确定最佳观测点。

Result: 在包括TruthfulQA在内的多个基准测试中，HSAD相比之前的最先进方法实现了超过10个百分点的改进。

Conclusion: 通过将推理过程建模与频域分析相结合，HSAD为LLMs中的鲁棒幻觉检测建立了新范式。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical barrier for deploying large language models
(LLMs) in reliability-sensitive applications. Existing detection methods
largely fall into two categories: factuality checking, which is fundamentally
constrained by external knowledge coverage, and static hidden-state analysis,
that fails to capture deviations in reasoning dynamics. As a result, their
effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal
Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that
models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive
generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across
layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain
representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as
spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of
LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable
detection. Across multiple benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, HSAD achieves over
10 percentage points improvement compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. By
integrating reasoning-process modeling with frequency-domain analysis, HSAD
establishes a new paradigm for robust hallucination detection in LLMs.

*Yongjian Tang,Doruk Tuncel,Christian Koerner,Thomas Runkler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型中的过度提示现象，发现过多的领域特定示例反而会降低模型性能，挑战了传统少样本学习的认知。通过多种少样本选择方法和多个LLM的实验，确定了最佳示例数量，在软件需求分类任务上实现了1%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中过度提示现象，即过多示例反而导致性能下降的问题，挑战传统少样本学习认为更多相关示例总是有益的认知。

Method: 使用随机采样、语义嵌入和TF-IDF向量三种少样本选择方法，在GPT-4o、GPT-3.5-turbo、DeepSeek-V3等多个LLM上进行实验，通过逐步增加TF-IDF选择的分层少样本示例数量来确定最优数量。

Result: 实验发现过度添加领域特定示例会降低某些LLM性能，确定了每个LLM的最佳示例数量，在软件功能和非功能需求分类任务上超越了现有最佳方法1%的性能。

Conclusion: 过度提示确实存在，需要为不同LLM确定最佳示例数量，组合方法可以用更少示例获得更好性能，避免过度提示问题。

Abstract: Over-prompting, a phenomenon where excessive examples in prompts lead to
diminished performance in Large Language Models (LLMs), challenges the
conventional wisdom about in-context few-shot learning. To investigate this
few-shot dilemma, we outline a prompting framework that leverages three
standard few-shot selection methods - random sampling, semantic embedding, and
TF-IDF vectors - and evaluate these methods across multiple LLMs, including
GPT-4o, GPT-3.5-turbo, DeepSeek-V3, Gemma-3, LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.2, and Mistral.
Our experimental results reveal that incorporating excessive domain-specific
examples into prompts can paradoxically degrade performance in certain LLMs,
which contradicts the prior empirical conclusion that more relevant few-shot
examples universally benefit LLMs. Given the trend of LLM-assisted software
engineering and requirement analysis, we experiment with two real-world
software requirement classification datasets. By gradually increasing the
number of TF-IDF-selected and stratified few-shot examples, we identify their
optimal quantity for each LLM. This combined approach achieves superior
performance with fewer examples, avoiding the over-prompting problem, thus
surpassing the state-of-the-art by 1% in classifying functional and
non-functional requirements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型在真实对话环境中解读人类人格特质的能力，发现当前模型与经过验证的心理结构对齐有限，所有相关系数均低于0.26。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在需要心理理解的角色中部署增多，如情感支持代理和决策助手，但其在生态有效的对话环境中解读人格特质的能力尚未被探索，特别是在与连续真实人格评估的对齐方面。

Method: 引入包含半结构化访谈记录和验证过的连续大五人格特质分数的新基准，系统评估了三种范式：1）GPT-4.1 Mini的零样本和思维链提示；2）对RoBERTa和Meta-LLaMA架构进行LoRA微调；3）使用预训练BERT和OpenAI文本嵌入的回归分析。

Result: 所有模型预测与真实人格特质之间的皮尔逊相关系数均低于0.26，思维链提示相比零样本提示仅有最小增益，表明人格推断更多依赖于潜在语义表征而非显式推理。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了将LLMs与复杂人类属性对齐的挑战，并推动了未来在特质特定提示、上下文感知建模和对齐导向微调方面的工作。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in roles requiring
nuanced psychological understanding, such as emotional support agents,
counselors, and decision-making assistants. However, their ability to interpret
human personality traits, a critical aspect of such applications, remains
unexplored, particularly in ecologically valid conversational settings. While
prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on
social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth
personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely
unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising
semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five
trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance
across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with
GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA
architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT
and OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small. Our results reveal that all Pearson
correlations between model predictions and ground-truth personality traits
remain below 0.26, highlighting the limited alignment of current LLMs with
validated psychological constructs. Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal
gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on
latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning. These findings
underscore the challenges of aligning LLMs with complex human attributes and
motivate future work on trait-specific prompting, context-aware modeling, and
alignment-oriented fine-tuning.

TL;DR: ChartGaze是一个新的眼动追踪数据集，通过比较人类和模型注意力模式，发现LVLMs在图表问答任务中注意力与人类注视存在差异，提出基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，显著提升了模型准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图表问答任务中经常关注不相关区域，与人类注视模式存在差异，导致可解释性和准确性下降，需要研究如何利用人类注视模式来改进模型。

Method: 构建ChartGaze眼动追踪数据集，系统比较人类和模型注意力模式，提出基于人类注视的注意力优化方法，将图像-文本注意力与人类注视点对齐。

Result: 该方法在多个模型上实现了最高2.56个百分点的准确率提升，同时改善了注意力对齐效果。

Conclusion: 人类注视信息可以有效提升图表相关LVLMs的推理质量和可解释性，展示了将人类认知模式融入模型优化的潜力。

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing
information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on
chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when
models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present
ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during
chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model
attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced
interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided
attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our
approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains
of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results
demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the
reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Motivation: 解决现有单上下文方法中的上下文窒息和噪声污染问题，构建能够自主发现和综合知识的AI代理

Method: 1) WebResearcher：将深度研究重新表述为马尔可夫决策过程，定期整合发现到演进报告中；2) WebFrontier：通过工具增强的复杂性升级生成高质量训练数据

Result: 在6个具有挑战性的基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，甚至超越了前沿专有系统，训练数据显著提升了工具使用能力

Conclusion: 该范式通过并行思维自然扩展，支持并发多代理探索以获得更全面的结论，为构建自主知识发现系统提供了有效框架

Abstract: Recent advances in deep-research systems have demonstrated the potential for
AI agents to autonomously discover and synthesize knowledge from external
sources. In this paper, we introduce WebResearcher, a novel framework for
building such agents through two key components: (1) WebResearcher, an
iterative deep-research paradigm that reformulates deep research as a Markov
Decision Process, where agents periodically consolidate findings into evolving
reports while maintaining focused workspaces, overcoming the context
suffocation and noise contamination that plague existing mono-contextual
approaches; and (2) WebFrontier, a scalable data synthesis engine that
generates high-quality training data through tool-augmented complexity
escalation, enabling systematic creation of research tasks that bridge the gap
between passive knowledge recall and active knowledge construction. Notably, we
find that the training data from our paradigm significantly enhances tool-use
capabilities even for traditional mono-contextual methods. Furthermore, our
paradigm naturally scales through parallel thinking, enabling concurrent
multi-agent exploration for more comprehensive conclusions. Extensive
experiments across 6 challenging benchmarks demonstrate that WebResearcher
achieves state-of-the-art performance, even surpassing frontier proprietary
systems.

Motivation: 现有基于通用基础模型的训练方法在智能体任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏强大的智能体基础模型，导致模型需要同时学习多样化智能体行为并与专家演示对齐，产生优化冲突

Method: 提出Agentic Continual Pre-training方法，将其整合到深度研究智能体训练流程中，开发了AgentFounder模型

Result: AgentFounder-30B在10个基准测试中取得state-of-the-art性能，包括BrowseComp-en 39.9%、BrowseComp-zh 43.3%、HLE Pass@1 31.5%，同时保持强大的工具使用能力

Conclusion: Agentic CPT方法有效解决了智能体基础模型缺失的问题，通过持续预训练构建了强大的智能体基础模型，显著提升了智能体任务的性能表现

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of
autonomous tool use and multi-step reasoning for complex problem-solving.
However, post-training approaches building upon general-purpose foundation
models consistently underperform in agentic tasks, particularly in open-source
implementations. We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic
foundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn
diverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby
creating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to
propose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the
deep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational
models. Based on this approach, we develop a deep research agent model named
AgentFounder. We evaluate our AgentFounder-30B on 10 benchmarks and achieve
state-of-the-art performance while retains strong tool-use ability, notably
39.9% on BrowseComp-en, 43.3% on BrowseComp-zh, and 31.5% Pass@1 on HLE.

Motivation: 现实世界应用需要大语言模型具备精确、鲁棒的函数调用智能，而函数调用能力的广度与训练环境的多样性密切相关，因此需要规模化环境来推进通用智能体智能

Method: 设计可扩展框架自动构建完全模拟的异构环境，采用两阶段智能体微调策略：先赋予基础智能体能力，再进行领域专业化训练

Result: 在tau-bench、tau2-Bench和ACEBench等智能体基准测试中，训练的AgentScaler模型显著提升了模型的函数调用能力

Conclusion: 通过规模化环境构建和两阶段训练策略，有效提升了智能体的函数调用智能，为推进通用智能体智能提供了可行方案

Abstract: Advanced agentic intelligence is a prerequisite for deploying Large Language
Models in practical, real-world applications. Diverse real-world APIs demand
precise, robust function-calling intelligence, which needs agents to develop
these capabilities through interaction in varied environments. The breadth of
function-calling competence is closely tied to the diversity of environments in
which agents are trained. In this work, we scale up environments as a step
towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central
challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how
to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through
interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable
framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are
fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling
scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first
endowing agents with fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them
for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks,
tau-bench, tau2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model,
AgentScaler, significantly enhances the function-calling capability of models.

Abstract: This paper tackles open-ended deep research (OEDR), a complex challenge where
AI agents must synthesize vast web-scale information into insightful reports.
Current approaches are plagued by dual-fold limitations: static research
pipelines that decouple planning from evidence acquisition and one-shot
generation paradigms that easily suffer from long-context failure issues like
"loss in the middle" and hallucinations. To address these challenges, we
introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human
research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively
interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a
comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence.
The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process,
composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of
only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively
mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art
across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and
DeepResearchGym. These results validate our human-centric, iterative
methodology, demonstrating that adaptive planning and focused synthesis are
crucial for producing high-quality, reliable, and well-structured reports.

TL;DR: ReSum是一种新的LLM网络代理范式，通过周期性上下文摘要实现无限探索，解决了ReAct等范式中的上下文窗口限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于LLM的网络代理在知识密集型任务上表现良好，但受到上下文窗口限制的阻碍。复杂查询涉及多个实体、交织关系和高不确定性，需要大量搜索周期，在达到完整解决方案之前迅速耗尽上下文预算。

Method: 引入ReSum范式，通过定期上下文摘要将不断增长的交互历史转换为紧凑的推理状态，保持对先前发现的意识同时绕过上下文约束。提出ReSum-GRPO，集成GRPO与分段轨迹训练和优势广播，使代理熟悉基于摘要的推理。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，ReSum相比ReAct平均绝对提升4.5%，经过ReSum-GRPO训练后进一步提升至8.2%。WebResummer-30B在BrowseComp-zh上达到33.3% Pass@1，在BrowseComp-en上达到18.3%，超越了现有的开源网络代理。

Conclusion: ReSum通过上下文摘要机制有效解决了LLM网络代理的上下文限制问题，结合GRPO训练进一步提升了性能，在有限训练样本下实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on
knowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in
paradigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined
relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly
exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this
challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite
exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing
interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of
prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,
we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and
advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned
reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three
benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of
4.5\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\% following ReSum-GRPO
training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a
ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\% Pass@1 on
BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web
agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文批判性评估了LLM激活描述方法，发现现有基准测试存在缺陷，这些方法往往反映的是描述器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的内部激活，需要更严格的基准和控制实验来验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估激活描述方法是否能真正揭示目标LLM的内部工作机制，还是仅仅反映了输入信息或描述器LLM的参数知识。

Method: 在先前工作使用的数据集上评估流行描述方法，进行控制实验分析描述内容来源，比较有无目标模型内部访问权限时的表现差异。

Result: 描述方法在无目标模型内部访问时也能在基准测试中成功，表明这些基准不理想；控制实验显示描述内容往往来自描述器LLM的参数知识而非目标模型的激活。

Conclusion: 需要针对性的基准测试和实验控制来严格评估描述方法是否能提供对LLM操作的有意义洞察，当前方法存在严重局限性。

Abstract: Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal
representations into natural language descriptions using a second verbalizer
LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and
operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually
provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model,
or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate
popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that
they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals,
suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization
methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations
often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated
them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken
together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental
controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful
insights into the operations of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无边界场景中的长距离相机轨迹（如飞越森林）需要提取网格表示，但单一静态网格会过大，而独立提取不同视角的网格会导致过渡时的视觉跳跃问题。

Method: 使用新的时空树结构——二进制八叉树进行4D网格提取，确保时间相干性。

Result: 相比现有基线方法，该方法在相当成本下提供了更优越的视觉一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的二进制八叉树方法能够有效解决无边界场景中长距离相机轨迹的网格提取问题，实现时间相干的视觉一致性。

Abstract: The procedural occupancy function is a flexible and compact representation
for creating 3D scenes. For rasterization and other tasks, it is often
necessary to extract a mesh that represents the shape. Unbounded scenes with
long-range camera trajectories, such as flying through a forest, pose a unique
challenge for mesh extraction. A single static mesh representing all the
geometric detail necessary for the full camera path can be prohibitively large.
Therefore, independent meshes can be extracted for different camera views, but
this approach may lead to popping artifacts during transitions. We propose a
temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera
trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key
idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure
called a binary-octree. Experiments show that, compared to existing baseline
methods, our method offers superior visual consistency at a comparable cost.

Conclusion: DISPLIB为火车调度研究社区提供了标准化基准，促进了算法性能的实证比较和研究的可复现性

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型仅编码训练时观察到的物理规律作为参数知识，无法处理违反这些规律的推理场景。人类具有从少量视觉示例中适应新物理环境的归纳推理能力，这对安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 提出InPhyRe视觉问答基准，通过算法生成的合成碰撞视频评估模型在违反物理规律的碰撞事件中的推理能力，测试了13个大型多模态模型。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在视觉输入的信任度方面存在问题，归纳物理推理能力有限，需要改进以适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路线规划方法存在局限性：直接使用LLM处理地图数据能力不足，图搜索方法理解自然语言偏好能力有限，且全球用户时空分布高度异构不可预测

Method: 使用LLM-as-Parser解析自然语言、识别任务、提取用户偏好和任务依赖关系，结合多步图构建与迭代搜索算法(MSGS)进行最优路线查找，采用多目标优化自适应调整权重

Result: 在14个国家27个城市的1000个不同复杂度路由提示上进行实验，结果表明该方法在多重约束下实现了优越性能

Conclusion: LLMAP系统能够有效处理自然语言驱动的路线规划问题，在保证多约束条件的同时实现最优路线规划

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Method: 开发了基于物联网的平台控制环境条件，并使用VGG-19、InceptionResNetV2和InceptionV3算法构建AI疾病检测框架

Result: 物联网系统能持续在线发布温度、湿度等数据并调整控制参数；VGG-19算法在疾病检测中达到92%的最高准确率

Conclusion: 该智能温室系统成功整合了物联网和人工智能技术，能够有效监测植物健康状态和环境条件，为精准农业管理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助研究工具虽然强大但分散，缺乏以人为中心的工作流程，需要整合的协作框架来提升科研效率和质量。

Method: 开发AIssistant框架，集成模块化工具和代理进行文献合成、分段实验、引用管理和自动LaTeX文本生成，保持人工监督。采用三层评估：独立人工评审、自动化LLM评审和程序主席监督。

Result: AIssistant提高了起草效率和主题一致性，但人机协作对于保持事实正确性、方法合理性和伦理合规性仍然至关重要。存在引用幻觉、动态论文结构适应困难和多模态内容整合不完全等局限性。

Conclusion: AIssistant作为人机协作框架有效提升了科研工作流效率，但需要进一步解决引用准确性、结构适应性和多模态整合等挑战，强调人机协作在科研中的持续重要性。

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小型设备端模型在UI交互意图理解上的困难，提供隐私保护、低成本和低延迟的用户体验

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 结构化交互摘要捕捉用户动作关键信息 2) 基于聚合摘要使用微调模型进行意图提取

Result: 该方法提升了资源受限模型的意图理解性能，甚至超越大型多模态大语言模型的基准表现

Conclusion: 分解式方法为设备端智能代理提供了有效的意图理解解决方案，在保持隐私和低延迟的同时实现了高性能

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\sys的熵增强框架，用于在多轮工具辅助环境中优化LLM的偏好对齐，在保持输出多样性的同时提升代码任务性能，在SWE-bench基准测试中取得了开源模型的最佳结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好优化方法（如DPO、KTO）虽然能对齐人类偏好，但会降低模型输出多样性，限制了测试时扩展的效果。现有方法主要针对单轮任务，无法有效处理多轮推理和工具集成所需的交互式编程代理复杂性。

Method: \sys框架通过增强偏好目标来显式保留策略熵，并将学习推广到优化多轮交互而非单轮响应。还提出了结合学习验证器和无模型方法的混合最佳轨迹选择方案来最大化测试时扩展的性能增益。

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，使用\sys训练的30B参数模型在开源权重模型中排名第一（lite版本）和第四（verified版本），仅被参数量超过10倍（>350B）的模型超越。

Conclusion: \sys框架成功地将偏好优化方法适应到多轮工具辅助设置中，在保持输出多样性的同时显著提升了LLM在软件工程任务上的性能，为交互式编程代理的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决世界模型在部署时的大小与性能权衡问题 - 大模型计算资源需求高难以在边缘设备部署，小模型物理建模能力不足导致预测效果差

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)，使用Soft Mask训练技术改善动态物体建模和未来预测，引入Warm Start推理技术零样本提升预测质量

Result: 在相同参数量(400M)下，PIWM比基线模型加权总分提升60.6%；最小PIWM模型(130M Soft Mask)相比最大基线模型(400M)加权总分高7.4%，推理速度快28%

Conclusion: PIWM通过创新的训练和推理技术，成功实现了小参数规模下的高性能物理动力学建模，为边缘设备部署高效世界模型提供了可行方案

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC)方法，通过在剪枝过程中同时重构输入和思维链激活，显著提升推理语言模型的压缩性能，解决了传统剪枝方法在推理任务中性能下降严重的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理语言模型（如DeepSeek-R1）在推理时产生长思维链轨迹，导致部署成本高昂。传统神经网络剪枝方法在推理任务中性能损失更大，甚至可能使模型更慢，因为标准剪枝方法主要关注输入重构，而推理是解码主导的任务。

Method: 提出RAC方法：在剪枝过程中联合重构来自输入的激活和模型在策略思维链轨迹的激活。该方法可无缝集成到现有剪枝工作流（如SparseGPT）中。

Result: RAC方法显著提升了现有剪枝方法的性能，解决了传统剪枝在推理任务中的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: RAC是一种简单、即插即用的解决方案，通过联合重构输入和思维链激活，有效提升了推理语言模型的压缩性能，为大规模部署推理模型提供了更高效的压缩方法。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the
paper can be found at: https://github.com/RyanLucas3/RAC

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,

Motivation: 认知科学和理论计算机科学都致力于分类和解释任务的难度，智能机制是那些能够降低任务难度的机制。研究旨在探索心智与物质能力如何协同工作来降低任务的有效时间复杂度。

Method: 通过分析Soma Cube拼图的分支因子（搜索树出度）来量化任务难度，逐步改进试错搜索方法：添加预处理（认知分块）、值排序（认知自由排序）、变量排序（认知支架）和剪枝（认知推理）。

Result: 研究发现合格使用人工制品可以通过利用物理约束来降低有效时间复杂度，不同认知策略能够显著改变问题的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出将智能建模为一个算法库，该库能够同时调用心智和物质的能力，通过"物质性原则"将计算复杂度概念与认知问题解决策略联系起来。

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

Conclusion: 该工作流将模式发现与案例级解释相结合，为公共安全分析提供了实用的可解释AI模板，支持现场筛查、对策选择和审计就绪报告。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the
scalability and reliability of the platform. This work introduces key design
patterns for real-time, consumer-facing AI systems that emphasize speed,
precision, and usability that highlights a practical path for deploying
performant agentic systems in dynamic environments.

*Minyu Chen,Guoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DaSAThco是一个基于大语言模型的框架，通过学习从实例特征到定制启发式集合的可泛化映射，解决了SAT求解器配置难以通用化的问题，实现了训练一次、广泛适应的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAT问题的异质性使得单一最优配置不可行，而现有的数据集特定方法缺乏泛化性且需要为新问题类型重新优化，成本高昂。

Method: 使用大语言模型，在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成多样化的专用启发式集合组合，然后学习自适应选择机制形成最终映射。

Result: 实验表明DaSAThco实现了优越性能，最重要的是在非自适应方法表现有限的情况下展示了强大的域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

*Anmol Singhal Navya Singhal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AD-FCoT是一个基于类比推理和思维链提示的金融新闻情感分析框架，无需额外训练即可提升LLM在金融情感分类和市场回报预测方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析方法难以捕捉复杂经济背景且缺乏透明推理，影响了系统可靠性。需要一种能够结合历史类比和结构化推理的方法来提升分析质量。

Method: 提出类比驱动的金融思维链(AD-FCoT)提示框架，通过引导LLM在新事件和相关历史场景之间建立类比，并将这些类比嵌入到结构化、逐步推理的思维链中。

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验表明，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确性上优于强基线方法，与市场回报的相关性显著更高，生成的解释与领域专业知识一致。

Conclusion: AD-FCoT通过纯提示方式有效结合类比推理和思维链，为金融分析提供了可解释的见解，无需额外训练数据或微调，展现了在实际金融分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GBV-SQL是一个多智能体框架，通过SQL2Text反向翻译验证来提升Text2SQL生成的语义准确性，同时揭示了基准数据中的系统性质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Text2SQL生成中语法正确但语义误解用户意图的问题，以及当前评估基准中普遍存在的黄金标准错误问题。

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多智能体框架，采用引导生成和SQL2Text反向翻译验证机制，通过专门智能体将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言来验证逻辑一致性。

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%执行准确率（提升5.8%），在去除错误样本后的Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，还揭示了基准数据完整性的重要性，强调了更严格数据集管理的必要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于随机森林(RF)的牛群体重增长预测方法MB CWG，在包含天气和年龄因素的数据集上表现最佳(R²=0.973)，优于SVR和LSTM模型，并开发了自动化预处理工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测牛群体重增长有助于大型畜牧场优化饲养策略、做出明智育种选择，并降低气候变异和市场波动的风险。

Method: 使用随机森林(RF)模型，并与支持向量回归(SVR)和长短期记忆(LSTM)模型进行比较，利用756个样本数据和天气数据(降雨和温度)进行月度体重增长预测。

Result: RF模型在所有数据集上表现最佳，当包含天气和年龄因素时达到R²=0.973、RMSE=0.040和MAE=0.033，显著优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明RF模型是预测牛群体重增长的强大工具，年龄和气候因素对预测准确性有重要影响，开发的自动化预处理工具可为未来研究提供基准数据集。

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

*Yong Xia,Jingxuan Li,YeTeng Sun,Jiarui Bu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe是一种新颖的心电图编码方法，将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，使任何LLM都能直接解释，解决了现有方法在可移植性、时间尺度信息学习和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在ECG分析中存在三个主要问题：模型特定的ECG编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer架构难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、黑盒特性限制临床采用。

Method: 通过构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，ECG-aBcDe将ECG信号转换为通用ECG语言，无需修改LLM架构即可直接微调预训练模型，实现双向可转换性并提取注意力热图。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR上达到竞争性性能，BLEU-4指标在数据集内和跨数据集评估中分别提升2.8倍和3.9倍，达到42.58和30.76分。

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe为ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，证明了该方法的可行性，显著提升了性能指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoCO是一个端到端的自动化约束优化方法，利用大型语言模型生成约束松弛策略，结合进化算法和蒙特卡洛树搜索来解决非线性组合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非线性组合优化问题(NCOPs)由于非凸性导致多模态解空间，传统方法依赖专家经验且缺乏系统性自动化。现有LLM方法主要作为被动约束验证器，无法处理复杂的约束交互。

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过三重表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码。建立双向(全局-局部)协同进化机制，结合进化算法进行局部优化和蒙特卡洛树搜索进行全局策略空间探索。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的NCOP基准测试上的综合实验验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能。

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习松弛约束的方法，革命性地解决了NCOPs问题，在碎片化解空间中实现了强化和多样化的最优平衡。

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估前沿大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索更高效的推理方法，以降低计算成本同时保持高性能。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型（2023年12月、2024年9月、2025年6月），评估准确性和推理策略忠实度。提出神经符号架构：用小参数LLM将问题标准化，然后用Z3 SMT求解器解析程序。

Result: 2023到2024年性能提升归因于隐藏思维链提示，2024到2025年思考模型带来显著改进。神经符号方法将计算成本显著降低（FLOPs减少），同时保持近乎完美性能（准确率接近100%）。推理FLOPs约为活跃参数与总token数乘积的两倍，实验误差在10%以内。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的推理能力随时间持续提升，神经符号架构是降低计算成本的有效方法，能够在保持高性能的同时大幅减少资源消耗，为高效推理系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: GRRAF是一种无需训练的图推理方法，利用检索增强生成和LLM的代码生成能力，通过生成可执行代码查询图数据库来完成各种图推理任务，在大多数任务上达到100%准确率且能扩展到万节点大图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图推理方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在通过结合RAG和LLM的代码生成能力，提供一种无需训练、灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 将目标图存储在图形数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息，并包含错误反馈循环和超时机制来确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，GRRAF在大多数图推理任务（包括环检测、二分图检查、最短路径计算和最大流）上达到100%准确率，token成本与图大小无关，在子图匹配任务上表现也很高，能有效扩展到10,000个节点的大图。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种无需训练的高效图推理方法，通过代码生成和检索增强的结合，在多种图任务上表现出色且具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Motivation: 现有方法将先验经验和知识视为整体单元，导致知识迁移效率低下且粒度粗糙，需要更细粒度的知识迁移机制

Method: 分层记忆架构 + 分层后见反思机制(H²R)，从历史交互中提炼可重用的分层知识，测试时分别检索高低层记忆

Result: 在两个基准测试中显示H²R能够提高泛化能力和决策性能，优于Expel等基线方法

Conclusion: 分层记忆架构和H²R机制有效解决了LLM智能体知识迁移的粒度问题，为多任务学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂推理中存在"过度思考"问题，现有方法在连续潜在空间推理中的核心瓶颈是高效生成和利用高质量潜在思维。基于SoftCoT++理论，潜在思维分布方差越大越接近真实分布。

Method: 1) 基于可学习先验的潜在思维生成架构，增加生成潜在思维向量的方差分布；2) 基于分布的定向优化范式，结合SFT损失、语义对齐损失（KL散度）和推理焦点损失（对比学习）的多目标协同训练策略。

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker通过增强潜在思维分布的方差和引入多目标优化策略，有效提升了大型语言模型的复杂推理能力，为解决过度思考问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high

architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations

Motivation: 现有MARL基准（如SMAC）主要关注微观操作，缺乏对高级战略智能的全面评估。需要新的基准来测试战术机动、时机协调和欺骗等战略元素。

Method: 基于《三十六计》设计12个星际争霸II场景，每个对应一个特定计策。提出多维度评估指标（能力利用率和推进效率等），集成最先进的MARL算法和LLM智能体进行实验。

Result: 实验结果表明HLSMAC能够有效评估多智能体的战略决策能力，为高级战略智能的发展提供了强大的测试平台。

Conclusion: HLSMAC填补了MARL基准在高级战略评估方面的空白，为多智能体战略决策研究提供了新的方向和评估标准。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FSRL是一种透明的对齐框架，通过训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器的可解释特征，实现与RLHF相当的效果，但更易于分析模型内部机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLHF方法导致参数变化分散且不透明，难以理解模型内部学到了什么，需要更透明的对齐方法。

Method: 使用特征引导强化学习（FSRL），训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取的可解释特征。

Result: FSRL在偏好优化方面与当前RLHF方法效果相当，机制分析发现适配器策略更倾向于提升风格特征而非明确的alignment概念。

Conclusion: FSRL为可解释的模型控制和alignment机制诊断提供了工具，揭示了偏好优化过程可能将风格呈现作为质量的代理指标。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

TL;DR: 提出基于进化算法的黑盒模型融合方法Evo-Merging，仅通过API推理查询实现大规模语言模型的无权重融合


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒大语言模型（如GPT-4）因权重不可得而无法使用传统任务向量方法进行模型融合的挑战

Method: 采用进化算法框架，包含稀疏去噪和符号感知缩放两个关键组件，通过API查询进行无导数优化

Result: 在多个任务上达到最先进性能，显著超越现有基线方法

Conclusion: Evo-Merging为黑盒大模型融合提供了有效解决方案，仅需推理API即可实现高性能模型集成

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一个隐私增强的持续学习框架PeCL，通过动态差分隐私和隐私引导的记忆雕刻，在保护敏感信息的同时保持模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续学习模型面临严重的隐私挑战，统一的差分隐私预算会导致模型性能显著下降，阻碍在隐私敏感领域的部署

Method: 1. 引入token级动态差分隐私策略，根据语义敏感性自适应分配隐私预算；2. 集成隐私引导的记忆雕刻模块，智能遗忘敏感信息并保留任务不变的历史知识

Result: 大量实验表明PeCL在隐私保护和模型效用之间实现了优越的平衡，在保持先前任务高精度的同时确保强大的隐私保护

Conclusion: PeCL框架通过动态隐私预算分配和智能记忆管理，有效解决了持续学习中的隐私-性能权衡问题，为隐私敏感应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Planning Copilot是一个集成多种规划工具的聊天机器人，通过自然语言指令调用工具，显著提升LLMs在长程规划任务中的表现，即使使用较小模型也能超越GPT-5。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)作为自主代理执行复杂任务时缺乏可靠的长期规划能力，需要弥补这一能力差距。

Method: 基于模型上下文协议(MCP)标准，集成多种规划工具（语法检查、规划器选择、调用、验证和执行模拟），支持任何兼容MCP的LLM而无需领域特定微调。

Result: 实验表明Planning Copilot在使用三个开源LLM时显著优于无规划工具的相同LLM，在有限定性比较中甚至超越了GPT-5。

Conclusion: 专用规划工具是使LLMs有效执行规划任务的有效途径，MCP标准为此类工具集成提供了可行框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文测试了安娜·卡列尼娜原则在不同媒介中的适用性，发现结构模式因媒介而异：小说遵循反向AKP顺序，维基百科结合AKP与有序模式，学术论文顺序上呈反向AKP但位置保持嘈杂，电影则按类型分化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证安娜·卡列尼娜原则（成功需要满足少量必要条件，失败形式多样）及其变体在不同文本媒介中的适用性，探索不同领域成功与失败的结构模式差异。

Method: 将文本表示为功能块序列，通过转换顺序和位置评估收敛性，分析小说、在线百科全书、研究论文和电影四种媒介的结构模式。

Result: 不同媒介呈现不同的结构原则：小说在顺序上遵循反向AKP；维基百科结合AKP与有序模式；学术论文顺序上呈反向AKP但位置保持嘈杂；电影结构因类型而异。

Conclusion: 成功取决于特定媒介的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同形态，结构模式具有媒介特异性。

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理社会模拟框架缺乏对事件组织的系统评估，且缺少与物理环境的可视化集成，限制了代理在空间中导航和与现实物品交互的能力。

Method: 开发MiniAgentPro可视化平台，包含直观的地图编辑器用于定制环境，以及带有流畅动画的模拟播放器。基于此工具创建包含8个不同事件场景的测试集（基础版和困难版变体）来评估代理能力。

Result: 使用GPT-4o进行的评估显示，在基础设置中代理表现良好，但在困难变体中突显了协调挑战。

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro平台为LLM代理在物理环境中的事件组织和协调能力提供了有效的可视化评估工具，揭示了当前代理在复杂协调任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces

platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含369个大学录取问题实例的新基准，用于评估大语言模型在匹配问题中的表现，发现LLMs在满足所有评估标准方面存在困难，推理模型表现优于传统模型，不同提示策略效果各异，迭代提示性能非单调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在数学推理和组合优化方面表现出色，但在需要偏好和结构约束的匹配问题中的应用仍未被充分探索，因此需要建立一个专门的基准来评估LLMs在这类问题上的性能。

Method: 创建了包含369个大学录取问题实例的基准，评估多个开源LLMs在可行性、稳定性和最优性三个维度的表现，测试了包括思维链、上下文学习和基于角色的提示等多种提示策略。

Result: LLMs能够满足某些约束但难以一致满足所有评估标准；推理模型（如QwQ和GPT-oss）显著优于传统模型；不同提示策略效果差异明显且无一致最优策略；迭代提示性能呈现非单调性，可能早期达到峰值后显著下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型推理性能和提示策略在具有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新的视角，揭示了LLMs在匹配问题中的局限性以及提示策略选择的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融犯罪合规成本不断上升但效果有限，现有AI解决方案不透明且不符合监管要求，需要开发更有效的合规系统。

Method: 采用行动设计研究(ADR)方法，与金融科技公司和监管机构合作，使用工件中心建模，为自主代理分配明确角色，实现任务特定模型路由和审计日志。

Result: 开发了参考架构和实际原型，展示了智能AI如何在监管约束下重构金融犯罪合规工作流程，支持透明度和机构信任。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在负责任的治理结构内嵌入自动化可以支持高风险监管环境中的透明度和机构信任，为AI驱动的合规提供了新的见解。

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于图的冲突集提取算法(G-CSEA)来解决伪布尔约束模型中不可行子集的识别问题，相比传统方法减少了求解器调用次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量可行性检查，而基于对偶射线分析的方法在处理伪布尔约束模型时可能失效，需要更高效的冲突检测方法

Method: 基于冲突驱动子句学习(CDCL)思想，在约束传播过程中构建蕴含图，检测到冲突时追踪所有贡献约束，生成冲突集，并可选择使用QuickXplain进一步最小化为IIS

Result: 开发了G-CSEA算法，能够有效提取冲突集，减少求解器调用次数，提高不可行性诊断效率

Conclusion: G-CSEA为伪布尔约束模型提供了一种高效的冲突集提取方法，特别适用于包含复杂调度规则的劳动力排班问题中的不可行性分析

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在糖尿病视网膜病变检测中的应用，比较了GPT-4o和MedGemma两种模型的表现，发现MedGemma在基线测试中表现更优，而GPT-4o在结合MedGemma描述性输出时能达到优异性能，表明MLLMs可改善DR筛查流程并作为临床AI辅助研究的可扩展模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查系统主要提供二元转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。确定最有效的输出格式以增强临床医生与AI的协作性能是一个难以大规模评估的经验性挑战。

Method: 研究测试了GPT-4o（通用MLLM）和MedGemma（开源医疗模型）在IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集上的表现。实验包括：(1)基线评估，(2)使用合成预测模拟AI辅助，(3)实际的AI-to-AI协作，其中GPT-4o整合MedGemma输出。

Result: MedGemma在基线评估中表现优于GPT-4o，具有更高的敏感性和AUROC。GPT-4o显示出近乎完美的特异性但敏感性较低。在协作中，GPT-4o在MedGemma描述性输出的指导下即使没有直接图像访问也能达到强性能（AUROC高达0.96）。

Conclusion: MLLMs可以改善糖尿病视网膜病变筛查流程，并作为研究不同输出配置下临床AI辅助的可扩展模拟器。开放式轻量级模型如MedGemma在资源有限环境中特别有价值，而描述性输出可以增强临床工作流程中的可解释性和临床医生信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence

next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念向量提取框架，能够从少量数据中分离出特定概念的表示，实现对LLM行为的精准干预，同时引发了对模型安全性的新担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生比预期更广泛的影响，需要更纯净的概念向量来实现针对性干预和更细粒度地理解LLM行为。

Method: 提出了RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式从少量示例中提取特定概念的表示向量，能够精确定位到100-200个神经元。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上，RepIt能够选择性抑制特定概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他安全功能；仅需12个示例和单个A6000 GPU即可提取稳健的目标表示。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了针对性干预可以抵消过度泛化问题，为更细粒度的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但也凸显了用有限计算和数据就能操纵模型的安全隐患。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition是一种新的计算认知建模范式，通过记忆化的知识星座来模拟语言智能体，使它们能够像人类一样通过模式识别、类比推理和认知负荷最小化来处理复杂现实问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语言智能体在复杂现实环境中的认知建模问题，提出一种能够模拟人类认知方式（如模式识别、习惯行为、类比推理）的新范式，以构建可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的智能体系统。

Method: 采用基于形状的建模方法，包括特定目标、假设、建模策略、知识库和实际模型实现，这些都在特定的认知架构中实施。形状是感官、语言、概念、情景和程序知识的记忆化星座。

Result: 提出了一个具体的、可验证的形状建模框架，能够处理典型和异常情况，支持在线学习、寻求人类帮助和情境理解等恢复方法。

Conclusion: 形状认知范式不仅为语言智能体提供了具体的建模方法，其原则还可以更广泛地应用于知识基础和混合AI领域，为这些领域注入新的活力。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.
